The social security wage base limit is $137,700.\\nThe Medicare tax rate is 1.45% each for the employee and employer, unchanged from 2019. There is no wage base limit for Medicare tax.\\nSocial security and Medicare taxes apply to the wages of household workers you pay $2,200 or more in cash wages in 2020. Social security and Medicare taxes apply to election workers who are paid $1,900 or more in cash or an equivalent form of compensation in 2020.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReminders\\n\\nQualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities.\\nFor tax years beginning after 2015, a qualified small business may elect to claim up to $250,000 of its credit for increasing research activities as a payroll tax credit against the employer share of social security tax. The payroll tax credit must be elected on an original income tax return that is timely filed (including extensions). The portion of the credit used against the employer share of social security tax is allowed in the first calendar quarter beginning after the date that the qualified small business filed its income tax return. The election and determination of the credit amount that will be used against the employer share of social security tax are made on Form 6765, Credit for Increasing Research Activities. The amount from Form 6765, line 44, must then be reported on Form 8974, Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities. Form 8974 is used to determine the amount of the credit that can be used in the current quarter. The amount from Form 8974, line 12, is reported on Form 941, line 11. If you’re claiming the research payroll tax credit on your Form 941, you must attach Form 8974 to that Form 941. For more information about the payroll tax credit, see Notice 2017-23, 2017-16 I.R.B. 1100, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-16_IRB#NOT-2017-23 and IRS.gov/ResearchPayrollTC. Also see Adjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities reported on line 11, later.\\n\\n\\nCertification program for professional employer organizations (PEOs).\\nThe Stephen Beck, Jr., ABLE Act of 2014 required the IRS to establish a voluntary certification program for PEOs. PEOs handle various payroll administration and tax reporting responsibilities for their business clients and are typically paid a fee based on payroll costs. To become and remain certified under the certification program, certified professional employer organizations (CPEOs) must meet various requirements described in sections 3511 and 7705 and related published guidance. Certification as a CPEO may affect the employment tax liabilities of both the CPEO and its customers. A CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer of any individual who performs services for a customer of the CPEO and is covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between the CPEO and the customer (CPEO contract), but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System. For more information or to apply to become a CPEO, go to IRS.gov/CPEO.\\nCPEOs generally must file Form 941 and Schedule R (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers, electronically. For more information about a CPEO’s requirement to file electronically, see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.\\n\\n\\nOutsourcing payroll duties.\\nGenerally, as an employer, you\\'re responsible to ensure that tax returns are filed and deposits and payments are made, even if you contract with a third party to perform these acts. You remain responsible if the third party fails to perform any required action. Before you choose to outsource any of your payroll and related tax duties (that is, withholding, reporting, and paying over social security, Medicare, FUTA, and income taxes) to a third-party payer, such as a payroll service provider or reporting agent, go to IRS.gov/OutsourcingPayrollDuties for helpful information on this topic. If a CPEO pays wages and other compensation to an individual performing services for you, and the services are covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between you and the CPEO (CPEO contract), then the CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer, but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. However, with respect to certain employees covered by a CPEO contract, you may also be treated as an employer of the employees and, consequently, may also be liable for federal employment taxes imposed on wages and other compensation paid by the CPEO to such employees. For more information on the different types of third-party payer arrangements, see section 16 in Pub. 15.\\n\\n\\nAggregate Form 941 filers.\\nAgents and CPEOs must complete Schedule R (Form 941) when filing an aggregate Form 941. Aggregate Forms 941 are filed by agents approved by the IRS under section 3504. To request approval to act as an agent for an employer, the agent files Form 2678 with the IRS unless you\\'re a state or local government agency acting as an agent under the special procedures provided in Rev. Proc. 2013-39, 2013-52 I.R.B. 830, available at IRS.gov/irb/2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39. Aggregate Forms 941 are also filed by CPEOs approved by the IRS under section 7705. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System at IRS.gov/CPEO. CPEOs file Form 8973, Certified Professional Employer Organization/Customer Reporting Agreement, to notify the IRS that they started or ended a service contract with a customer. CPEOs generally must file Form 941 and Schedule R electronically. For more information about a CPEO’s requirement to file electronically, see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf both an employer and a section 3504 authorized agent paid wages to an employee during a quarter, or if both an employer and a CPEO paid wages to an employee during a quarter, both the employer and the section 3504 authorized agent (or the CPEO, if applicable) should file Form 941 reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the applicable quarter and issue Forms W-2 reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the year.\\n\\nWork opportunity tax credit for qualified tax-exempt organizations hiring qualified veterans.\\nQualified tax-exempt organizations that hire eligible unemployed veterans may be able to claim the work opportunity tax credit against their payroll tax liability using Form 5884-C. For more information, go to IRS.gov/WOTC.\\n\\n\\nCOBRA premium assistance credit.\\nEffective for tax periods beginning after 2013, the credit for COBRA premium assistance payments can\\'t be claimed on Form 941. Instead, after filing your Form 941, file Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit. Filing a Form 941-X before filing a Form 941 for the quarter may result in errors or delays in processing your Form 941-X. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 941-X. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re entitled to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit, but aren\\'t otherwise required to file Form 941, file a Form 941 with -0- entered on line 14 before filing a Form 941-X to claim the credit.\\n\\n\\nCorrecting a previously filed Form 941.\\nIf you discover an error on a previously filed Form 941, make the correction using Form 941-X. Form 941-X is filed separately from Form 941. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 941-X, section 13 of Pub. 15, or go to IRS.gov/CorrectingEmploymentTaxes.\\n\\n\\nFederal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT).\\nYou must use EFT to make all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). If you don\\'t want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your behalf. Also, you may arrange for your financial institution to initiate a same-day wire payment on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of the Treasury. Services provided by your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other third party may have a fee.\\nFor more information on making federal tax deposits, see section 11 of Pub. 15. To get more information about EFTPS or to enroll in EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov, or call 800-555-4477 or 800-733-4829 (TDD). Additional information about EFTPS is also available in Pub. 966.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor an EFTPS deposit to be on time, you must submit the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date the deposit is due.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSame-day wire payment option.\\nIf you fail to submit a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Collection Service (FTCS) to make a same-day wire payment. To use the same-day wire payment method, you will need to make arrangements with your financial institution ahead of time. Please check with your financial institution regarding availability, deadlines, and costs. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for payments made this way. To learn more about the information you will need to give your financial institution to make a same-day wire payment, go to IRS.gov/SameDayWire.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTimeliness of federal tax deposits.\\nIf a deposit is required to be made on a day that isn\\'t a business day, the deposit is considered timely if it is made by the close of the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The term \"legal holiday\" for deposit purposes includes only those legal holidays in the District of Columbia. Legal holidays in the District of Columbia are provided in section 11 of Pub. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\nElectronic filing and payment.\\nBusinesses can enjoy the benefits of filing tax returns and paying their federal taxes electronically. Whether you rely on a tax professional or handle your own taxes, the IRS offers you convenient programs to make filing and paying easier. Spend less time worrying about taxes and more time running your business. Use e-file and EFTPS to your benefit.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor e-file, go to IRS.gov/EmploymentEfile for additional information. A fee may be charged to file electronically.\\n\\n\\nFor EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov, or call EFTPS Customer Service at 800-555-4477 or 800-733-4829 (TDD) for additional information.\\n\\n\\nFor electronic filing of Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, go to SSA.gov/employer. You may be required to file Forms W-2 electronically. For details, see the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re filing your tax return or paying your federal taxes electronically, a valid employer identification number (EIN) is required at the time the return is filed or the payment is made. If a valid EIN isn\\'t provided, the return or payment won\\'t be processed. This may result in penalties. See Employer identification number (EIN), later, for information about applying for an EIN.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nElectronic funds withdrawal (EFW).\\nIf you file Form 941 electronically, you can e-file and use EFW to pay the balance due in a single step using tax preparation software or through a tax professional. However, don\\'t use EFW to make federal tax deposits. For more information on paying your taxes using EFW, go to IRS.gov/EFW. \\n\\n\\n\\nCredit or debit card payments.\\nYou can pay the balance due shown on Form 941 by credit or debit card. Your payment will be processed by a payment processor who will charge a processing fee. Don\\'t use a credit or debit card to make federal tax deposits. For more information on paying your taxes with a credit or debit card, go to IRS.gov/PayByCard. \\n\\n\\nOnline payment agreement.\\nYou may be eligible to apply for an installment agreement online if you can\\'t pay the full amount of tax you owe when you file your return. For more information, see What if you can\\'t pay in full, later.\\n\\n\\nPaid preparers.\\nIf you use a paid preparer to complete Form 941, the paid preparer must complete and sign the paid preparer\\'s section of the form.\\n\\n\\nWhere can you get telephone help?\\nFor answers to your questions about completing Form 941 or tax deposit rules, you can call the IRS at 800-829-4933 or 800-829-4059 (TDD/TTY for persons who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability), Monday–Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. local time (Alaska and Hawaii follow Pacific time).\\n\\n\\nPhotographs of missing children.\\nThe IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in instructions on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Instructions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPurpose of Form 941\\nThese instructions give you some background information about Form 941. They tell you who must file Form 941, how to complete it line by line, and when and where to file it.\\nIf you want more in-depth information about payroll tax topics relating to Form 941, see Pub. 15 or go to IRS.gov/EmploymentTaxes.\\nFederal law requires you, as an employer, to withhold certain taxes from your employees\\' pay. Each time you pay wages, you must withhold—or take out of your employees\\' pay—certain amounts for federal income tax, social security tax, and Medicare tax. You must also withhold Additional Medicare Tax from wages you pay to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. Under the withholding system, taxes withheld from your employees are credited to your employees in payment of their tax liabilities.\\nFederal law also requires you to pay any liability for the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes. This share of social security and Medicare taxes isn\\'t withheld from employees.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must File Form 941?\\nIf you pay wages subject to federal income tax withholding or social security and Medicare taxes, you must file Form 941 quarterly to report the following amounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWages you’ve paid.\\n\\n\\nTips your employees reported to you.\\n\\n\\nFederal income tax you withheld.\\n\\n\\nBoth the employer and the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Medicare Tax withheld from employees.\\n\\n\\nCurrent quarter\\'s adjustments to social security and Medicare taxes for fractions of cents, sick pay, tips, and group-term life insurance.\\n\\n\\nQualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon\\'t use Form 941 to report backup withholding or income tax withholding on nonpayroll payments such as pensions, annuities, and gambling winnings. Report these types of withholding on Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax. Also, don\\'t use Form 941 to report unemployment taxes. Report unemployment taxes on Form 940, Employer\\'s Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return.\\nAfter you file your first Form 941, you must file a return for each quarter, even if you have no taxes to report, unless you filed a final return or one of the exceptions listed next applies.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExceptions\\nSpecial rules apply to some employers.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you received notification to file Form 944, you must file Form 944 annually; don\\'t file Form 941 quarterly.\\n\\n\\nSeasonal employers don\\'t have to file a Form 941 for quarters in which they have no tax liability because they have paid no wages. To tell the IRS that you won\\'t file a return for one or more quarters during the year, check the box on line 18 every quarter you file Form 941. See section 12 of Pub. 15 for more information.\\n\\n\\nEmployers of household employees don\\'t usually file Form 941. See Pub. 926 and Schedule H (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for more information.\\n\\n\\nEmployers of farm employees don\\'t file Form 941 for wages paid for agricultural labor. See Form 943 and Pub. 51 for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf none of the above exceptions applies and you haven\\'t filed a final return, you must file Form 941 each quarter even if you didn\\'t pay wages during the quarter. Use IRS e-file, if possible.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRequesting To File Forms 941 Instead of Form 944, or Requesting To File Form 944 Instead of Forms 941\\n\\nRequesting to file Forms 941 instead of Form 944.\\nEmployers that would otherwise be required to file Form 944, Employer\\'s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return, may contact the IRS to request to file quarterly Forms 941 instead of annual Form 944. To request to file quarterly Forms 941 to report your social security and Medicare taxes for the 2020 calendar year, you must either call the IRS at 800-829-4933 between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020, or send a written request postmarked between January 1, 2020, and March 16, 2020. After you contact the IRS, the IRS will send you a written notice that your filing requirement has been changed to Forms 941. You must receive written notice from the IRS to file Forms 941 instead of Form 944 before you may file these forms. If you don\\'t receive this notice, you must file Form 944 for calendar year 2020.\\n\\n\\nRequesting to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941.\\nIf you’re required to file Forms 941 but believe your employment taxes for calendar year 2020 will be $1,000 or less, you may request to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941 by calling the IRS at 800-829-4933 between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020, or sending a written request postmarked between January 1, 2020, and March 16, 2020. After you contact the IRS, the IRS will send you a written notice that your filing requirement has been changed to Form 944. You must receive written notice from the IRS to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941 before you may file this form. If you don\\'t receive this notice, you must file Forms 941 for calendar year 2020. \\n\\n\\nWhere to send written requests.\\nWritten requests should be sent to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDepartment of the Treasury \\n\\xa0\\nDepartment of the Treasury\\n\\n\\nInternal Revenue Service\\nor \\nInternal Revenue Service \\n\\n\\nOgden, UT 84201-0038\\n\\xa0\\nCincinnati, OH 45999-0038\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you would mail your return filed without a payment to Ogden, as shown under Where Should You File, later, send your request to the Ogden address shown above. If you would mail your return filed without a payment to Kansas City, send your request to the address for Cincinnati shown above. For more information about these procedures, see Rev. Proc. 2009-51, 2009-45 I.R.B. 625, available at IRS.gov/irb/2009-45_IRB#RP-2009-51.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat if You Reorganize or Close Your Business?\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIf You Sell or Transfer Your Business . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you sell or transfer your business during the quarter, you and the new owner must each file a Form 941 for the quarter in which the transfer occurred. Report only the wages you paid.\\nWhen two businesses merge, the continuing firm must file a return for the quarter in which the change took place and the other firm should file a final return.\\nChanging from one form of business to another—such as from a sole proprietorship to a partnership or corporation—is considered a transfer. If a transfer occurs, you may need a new EIN. See Pub. 1635 and section 1 of Pub. 15 for more information.\\nAttach a statement to your return with:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe new owner\\'s name (or the new name of the business);\\n\\n\\nWhether the business is now a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation;\\n\\n\\nThe kind of change that occurred (a sale or transfer);\\n\\n\\nThe date of the change; and\\n\\n\\nThe name of the person keeping the payroll records and the address where those records will be kept.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Your Business Has Closed . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you go out of business or stop paying wages to your employees, you must file a final return. To tell the IRS that Form 941 for a particular quarter is your final return, check the box on line 17 and enter the final date you paid wages. Also attach a statement to your return showing the name of the person keeping the payroll records and the address where those records will be kept.\\nSee Terminating a business in the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for information about earlier dates for the expedited furnishing and filing of Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, when a final Form 941 is filed.\\nIf you participated in a statutory merger or consolidation, or qualify for predecessor-successor status due to an acquisition, you should generally file Schedule D (Form 941), Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations. See the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) to determine whether you should file Schedule D (Form 941) and when you should file it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen Must You File?\\nFile your initial Form 941 for the quarter in which you first paid wages that are subject to social security and Medicare taxes or subject to federal income tax withholding. See the table titled When To File Form 941, later.\\nThen you must file for every quarter after that—every 3 months—even if you have no taxes to report, unless you’re a seasonal employer or are filing your final return. See Seasonal employers and If Your Business Has Closed, earlier.\\nFile Form 941 only once for each quarter. If you filed electronically, don\\'t file a paper Form 941. For more information about filing Form 941 electronically, see Electronic filing and payment, earlier.\\n\\nWhen To File Form 941\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Form 941 is due by the last day of the month that follows the end of the quarter.\\n\\n\\nThe Quarter Includes . . .\\nQuarter Ends\\nForm 941\\n\\t\\t\\tIs Due\\n\\n\\n1.

October, November, December\\nDecember 31\\nJanuary 31\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor example, you generally must report wages you pay during the first quarter—which is January through March—by April 30. If you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the quarter, you may file by the 10th day of the second month that follows the end of the quarter. For example, you may file Form 941 by May 10 if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the first quarter.\\nIf we receive Form 941 after the due date, we will treat Form 941 as filed on time if the envelope containing Form 941 is properly addressed, contains sufficient postage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the due date, or sent by an IRS-designated private delivery service (PDS) on or before the due date. If you don\\'t follow these guidelines, we generally will consider Form 941 filed when it is actually received. For more information about PDSs, see Where Should You File, later.\\nIf any due date for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file your return on the next business day.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow Should You Complete Form 941?\\nType or print your EIN, name, and address in the spaces provided. Also enter your name and EIN on the top of page 2. Don\\'t use your social security number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Generally, enter the business (legal) name you used when you applied for your EIN. For example, if you’re a sole proprietor, enter \"Haleigh Smith\" on the \"Name\" line and \"Haleigh\\'s Cycles\" on the \"Trade name\" line. Leave the \"Trade name\" line blank if it is the same as your \"Name.\"\\nIf you use a tax preparer to fill out Form 941, make sure the preparer shows your business name exactly as it appeared when you applied for your EIN.\\n\\nEmployer identification number (EIN).\\nTo make sure businesses comply with federal tax laws, the IRS monitors tax filings and payments by using a numerical system to identify taxpayers. A unique nine-digit EIN is assigned to all corporations, partnerships, and some sole proprietors. Businesses needing an EIN must apply for a number and use it throughout the life of the business on all tax returns, payments, and reports.\\nYour business should have only one EIN. If you have more than one and aren\\'t sure which one to use, write to the IRS office where you file your returns (using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, later) or call the IRS at 800-829-4933.\\nIf you don\\'t have an EIN, you may apply for one online by visiting IRS.gov/EIN. You may also apply for an EIN by faxing or mailing Form SS-4 to the IRS. If the principal business was created or organized outside of the United States or U.S. territories, you may also apply for an EIN by calling 267-941-1099 (toll call). If you haven\\'t received your EIN by the due date of Form 941, file a paper return and write \"Applied For\" and the date you applied in this entry space.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re filing your tax return electronically, a valid EIN is required at the time the return is filed. If a valid EIN isn\\'t provided, the return won\\'t be accepted. This may result in penalties.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAlways be sure the EIN on the form you file exactly matches the EIN the IRS assigned to your business. Don\\'t use your SSN or ITIN on forms that ask for an EIN. Filing a Form 941 with an incorrect EIN or using another business\\'s EIN may result in penalties and delays in processing your return.\\n\\n\\nIf you change your business name, business address, or responsible party...\\nNotify the IRS immediately if you change your business name, business address, or responsible party.\\n\\n\\n\\nWrite to the IRS office where you file your returns (using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, later) to notify the IRS of any business name change. See Pub.1635 to see if you need to apply for a new EIN.\\n\\n\\nComplete and mail Form 8822-B to notify the IRS of a business address or responsible party change. Don\\'t mail Form 8822-B with your Form 941. For a definition of \"responsible party,\" see the Instructions for Form SS-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCheck the Box for the Quarter\\nUnder \"Report for this Quarter of 2020\" at the top of Form 941, check the appropriate box of the quarter for which you’re filing. Make sure the quarter checked is the same as shown on any attached Schedule B (Form 941), Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule Depositors, or Schedule R (Form 941).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCompleting and Filing Form 941\\nMake entries on Form 941 as follows to enable accurate scanning and processing.\\n\\n\\n\\nUse 10-point Courier font (if possible) for all entries if you’re typing or using a computer to complete your form. Portable Document Format (PDF) forms on IRS.gov have fillable fields with acceptable font specifications.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t enter dollar signs and decimal points. Commas are optional. Enter dollars to the left of the preprinted decimal point and cents to the right of it. Don’t round entries to whole dollars. Always show an amount for cents, even if it is zero.\\n\\n\\nLeave blank any data field (except lines 1, 2, and 12) with a value of zero.\\n\\n\\nEnter negative amounts using a minus sign (if possible). Otherwise, use parentheses.\\n\\n\\nEnter your name and EIN on all pages.\\n\\n\\nEnter your name, EIN, \"Form 941,\" and the tax year and quarter on all attachments.\\n\\n\\nStaple multiple sheets in the upper left corner when filing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRequired Notice to Employees About the Earned Income Credit (EIC)\\nTo notify employees about the EIC, you must give the employees one of the following items.\\n\\n\\n\\nForm W-2 which has the required information about the EIC on the back of Copy B.\\n\\n\\nA substitute Form W-2 with the same EIC information on the back of the employee\\'s copy that is on Copy B of the IRS Form W-2.\\n\\n\\nNotice 797, Possible Federal Tax Refund Due to the Earned Income Credit (EIC).\\n\\n\\nYour written statement with the same wording as\\n\\tNotice 797.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information, see section 10 of Pub. 15, Pub. 596, and IRS.gov/EIC.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReconciling Forms 941 and Form W-3\\nThe IRS matches amounts reported on your four quarterly Forms 941 with Form W-2 amounts totaled on your yearly Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements. If the amounts don\\'t agree, you may be contacted by the IRS or the Social Security Administration (SSA). The following amounts are reconciled.\\n\\n\\n\\nFederal income tax withholding.\\n\\n\\nSocial security wages.\\n\\n\\nSocial security tips.\\n\\n\\nMedicare wages and tips.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information, see section 12 of Pub. 15 and the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhere Should You File?\\nYou’re encouraged to file Form 941 electronically. Go to IRS.gov/EmploymentEfile for more information on electronic filing. If you file a paper return, where you file depends on whether you include a payment with Form 941. Mail your return to the address listed for your location in the table that follows.\\nPDSs can\\'t deliver to P.O. boxes. You must use the U.S. Postal Service to mail an item to a P.O. box address. Go to IRS.gov/PDS for the current list of PDSs. For the IRS mailing address to use if you’re using a PDS, go to IRS.gov/PDSstreetAddresses.

Don\\'t send Form 941 or any payments to the SSA.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDepositing Your Taxes\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou must deposit all depository taxes electronically by EFT. For more information, see Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) under Reminders, earlier.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMust You Deposit Your Taxes?\\nYou may have to deposit the federal income taxes you withheld and both the employer and employee social security taxes and Medicare taxes.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) are less than $2,500 for the current quarter or the prior quarter, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. You don\\'t have to make a deposit. To avoid a penalty, you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely. For more information on paying with a timely filed return, see the instructions for line 14, later. If you’re not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $2,500 (and your liability for the prior quarter wasn\\'t less than $2,500), make deposits using the semiweekly or monthly rules so you won\\'t be subject to failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalties.\\n\\n\\nIf your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) are $2,500 or more for the current quarter and the prior quarter. You must make deposits according to your deposit schedule. See section 11 of Pub. 15 for information about payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule and for rules about federal tax deposits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou may reduce your deposits during the quarter by the amount of the COBRA premium assistance credit that will be reflected on your Form 941-X, but only if you use the claim process and not the adjustment process to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit on your Form 941-X for the quarter.\\nThe COBRA premium assistance credit is treated as a credit on the first day of the return period (that is, January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). However, because the credit is now claimed on Form 941-X filed after submission of the Form 941, an employer that reduces its required deposits in anticipation of the credit will receive a system-generated notice reflecting a balance due and associated penalties and interest, if applicable. The balance due, including any related penalties and interest, resulting from the reduction in deposits in anticipation of the credit will be abated when the credit is applied. Such abatement will generally occur without any further action from the employer.\\nAlternatively, to prevent triggering a system-generated balance due notice, the employer can make its deposits without a reduction in anticipation of the COBRA premium assistance credit and follow the ordinary procedures for filing a claim for refund or adjusted return using Form 941-X.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen Must You Deposit Your Taxes?\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine if You’re a Monthly or Semiweekly Schedule Depositor for the Quarter\\n\\n\\n\\nThe IRS uses two different sets of deposit rules to determine when businesses must deposit their social security, Medicare, and withheld federal income taxes. These schedules tell you when a deposit is due after you have a payday.\\nYour deposit schedule isn\\'t determined by how often you pay your employees. Your deposit schedule depends on the total tax liability you reported on Form 941 during the previous 4-quarter lookback period (July 1 of the second preceding calendar year through June 30 of the preceding calendar year). See section 11 of Pub. 15 for details. If you filed Form 944 in either 2018 or 2019, your lookback period is the 2018 calendar year.\\nBefore the beginning of each calendar year, determine which type of deposit schedule you must use.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor.\\n\\n\\nIf you reported more than $50,000 of taxes during the lookback period, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re a monthly schedule depositor and accumulate a $100,000 tax liability on any day during the deposit period, you become a semiweekly schedule depositor on the next day and remain so for at least the rest of the calendar year and for the following calendar year. See $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule in section 11 of Pub. 15 for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat About Penalties and Interest?\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAvoiding Penalties and Interest\\nYou can avoid paying penalties and interest if you do all of the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nDeposit or pay your taxes when they are due.\\n\\n\\nFile your fully completed Form 941 on time.\\n\\n\\nReport your tax liability accurately.\\n\\n\\nSubmit valid checks for tax payments.\\n\\n\\nFurnish accurate Forms W-2 to employees.\\n\\n\\nFile Form W-3 and Copy A of Forms W-2 with the SSA on time and accurately.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPenalties and interest are charged on taxes paid late and returns filed late at a rate set by law. See sections 11 and 12 of Pub. 15 for details.\\nUse Form 843 to request abatement of assessed penalties or interest. Don\\'t request abatement of assessed penalties or interest on Form 941 or Form 941-X.\\nIf you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don\\'t attach an explanation when you file your return.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf federal income, social security, and Medicare taxes that must be withheld (that is, trust fund taxes) aren\\'t withheld or aren\\'t deposited or paid to the United States Treasury, the trust fund recovery penalty may apply. The penalty is 100% of the unpaid trust fund tax. If these unpaid taxes can\\'t be immediately collected from the employer or business, the trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to be responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. For more information, see section 11 of Pub. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAdjustment of Tax on Tips\\nIf, by the 10th of the month after the month you received an employee\\'s report on tips, you don\\'t have enough employee funds available to withhold the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes, you no longer have to collect it. Report the entire amount of these tips on line 5b (Taxable social security tips), line 5c (Taxable Medicare wages and tips), and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 5d (Taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding). Include as a negative adjustment on line 9 the total uncollected employee share of the social security and Medicare taxes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart 1: Answer These Questions for This Quarter\\n\\n\\xa0\\n1. Number of Employees Who Received Wages, Tips, or Other Compensation\\nEnter the number of employees on your payroll for the pay period including March 12, June 12, September 12, or December 12, for the quarter indicated at the top of\\nForm 941.

Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation\\nEnter amounts on line 2 that would also be included in box 1 of your employees\\' Forms W-2. See Box 1—Wages, tips, other compensation in the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for details. Include sick pay paid by a third party if you were given timely notice of the payments and the third party transferred liability for the employer\\'s taxes to you.\\nIf you’re a third-party payer of sick pay, don\\'t include sick pay that you paid to policyholders\\' employees here if you gave the policyholders timely notice of the payments. See section 6 of Pub. 15-A, Employer\\'s Supplemental Tax Guide, for more information about sick pay reporting and the procedures for transferring the liability to the employer.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n3. Federal Income Tax Withheld From Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation\\nEnter the federal income tax you withheld (or were required to withhold) from your employees on this quarter\\'s wages, tips, taxable fringe benefits, and supplemental unemployment compensation benefits. Don\\'t include any income tax withheld by a third-party payer of sick pay even if you reported it on Forms W-2. You will reconcile this difference on Form W-3. Also include here any excise taxes you were required to withhold on golden parachute payments (section 4999). For information on the employment tax treatment of fringe benefits, see Pub. 15-B, Employer\\'s Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits. For information about supplemental unemployment compensation benefits and golden parachute payments, see section 5 of Pub. 15-A.\\nIf you’re a third-party payer of sick pay, enter the federal income tax you withheld (or were required to withhold) on third-party sick pay here.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n4. If No Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation Are Subject to Social Security or Medicare Tax . . .\\nIf no wages, tips, and other compensation on line 2 are subject to social security or Medicare tax, check the box on line 4. If this question doesn\\'t apply to you, leave the box blank. For more information about exempt wages, see section 15 of Pub. 15. For religious exemptions, see section 4 of Pub. 15-A.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re a government employer, wages you pay aren\\'t automatically exempt from social security and Medicare taxes. Your employees may be covered by law or by a voluntary Section 218 Agreement with the SSA. For more information, see Pub. 963, Federal-State Reference Guide.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n5a–5e. Taxable Social Security and Medicare Wages and Tips\\n\\n\\xa0\\n5a. Taxable social security wages.\\nEnter the total wages, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits subject to social security taxes you paid to your employees during the quarter. For this purpose, sick pay includes payments made by an insurance company to your employees for which you received timely notice from the insurance company. See section 6 in Pub. 15-A for more information about sick pay reporting.\\nEnter the amount before payroll deductions. Don\\'t include tips on this line. For information on types of wages subject to social security taxes, see section 5 of Pub. 15.\\nFor 2020, the rate of social security tax on taxable wages is 6.2% (0.062) each for the employer and employee or 12.4% (0.124) for both. Stop paying social security tax on and entering an employee\\'s wages on line 5a when the employee\\'s taxable wages (including tips) reach $137,700 for the year. However, continue to withhold income and Medicare taxes for the whole year on wages and tips even when the social security wage base of $137,700 has been reached.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nline 5a\\n(column 1)\\n\\n\\nx 0.124\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nline 5a\\n(column 2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n5b. Taxable social security tips.\\nEnter all tips your employees reported to you during the quarter until the total of the tips and wages for an employee reach $137,700 for the year. Include all tips your employee reported to you even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 6.2%. You will reduce your total taxes by the amount of any uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on tips later on line 9; see Current quarter\\'s adjustments for tips and group-term life insurance, later. Don’t include service charges on line 5b. For details about the difference between tips and service charges, see Rev. Rul. 2012-18, 2012-26 I.R.B. 1032, available at IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18.\\nYour employee must report cash tips to you by the 10th day of the month after the month the tips are received. Cash tips include tips paid by cash, check, debit card, and credit card. The report should include charged tips (for example, credit and debit card charges) you paid over to the employee for charge customers, tips the employee received directly from customers, and tips received from other employees under any tip-sharing arrangement. Both directly and indirectly tipped employees must report tips to you. No report is required for months when tips are less than $20. Employees may use Form 4070 (available only in Pub. 1244), or submit a written statement or electronic tip record.\\nDon\\'t include allocated tips (described in section 6 of Pub. 15) on this line. Instead, report them on Form 8027. Allocated tips aren\\'t reportable on Form 941 and aren\\'t subject to withholding of federal income, social security, or Medicare taxes.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nline 5b\\n(column 1)\\n\\n\\nx 0.124\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nline 5b\\n(column 2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n5c. Taxable Medicare wages & tips.\\nEnter all wages, tips, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits that are subject to Medicare tax. Unlike social security wages, there is no limit on the amount of wages subject to Medicare tax.\\nThe rate of Medicare tax is 1.45% (0.0145) each for the employer and employee or 2.9% (0.029) for both. Include all tips your employees reported during the quarter, even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 1.45%.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nline 5c\\n(column 1)\\n\\n\\nx 0.029\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nline 5c\\n(column 2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information on tips, see section 6 of Pub. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n5d. Taxable wages & tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding.\\nEnter all wages, tips, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits that are subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding. You’re required to begin withholding Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which you pay wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. Additional Medicare Tax is only imposed on the employee. There is no employer share of Additional Medicare Tax. All wages that are subject to Medicare tax are subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding if paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold.\\nFor more information on what wages are subject to Medicare tax, see the chart, Special Rules for Various Types of Services and Payments, in section 15 of Pub. 15. For more information on Additional Medicare Tax, go to IRS.gov/ADMT.\\nOnce wages and tips exceed the $200,000 withholding threshold, include all tips your employees reported during the quarter, even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 0.9%.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nline 5d\\n(column 1)\\n\\n\\nx 0.009\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nline 5d\\n(column 2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n5e.

Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand—Tax Due on Unreported Tips\\nEnter the tax due from your Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand on line 5f. The IRS issues a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand to advise an employer of the amount of tips received by employees who failed to report or underreported tips to the employer. An employer isn\\'t liable for the employer share of the social security and Medicare taxes on unreported tips until notice and demand for the taxes is made to the employer by the IRS in a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand. The tax due may have been determined from tips reported to the IRS on employees\\' Forms 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income, or other tips that weren\\'t reported to their employer as determined by the IRS during an examination. For additional information, see Rev. Rul. 2012-18, 2012-26 I.R.B. 1032, available at IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18.\\nDeposit the tax within the time period required under your deposit schedule to avoid any possible deposit penalty. The tax is treated as accumulated by the employer on the \"Date of Notice and Demand\" as printed on the Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand. The employer must include this amount on the appropriate line of the record of federal tax liability (Part 2 of Form 941 for a monthly schedule depositor or Schedule B (Form 941) for a semiweekly schedule depositor).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n6. Total Taxes Before Adjustments\\nAdd the total federal income tax withheld from wages, tips, and other compensation (line 3), the total social security and Medicare taxes before adjustments (line 5e), and any tax due under a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand (line 5f). Enter the result on line 6.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n7–9. Tax Adjustments\\nEnter tax amounts on lines 7–9 that result from current quarter adjustments. Use a minus sign (if possible) to show an adjustment that decreases the total taxes shown on line 6 instead of parentheses. Doing so enhances the accuracy of our scanning software. For example, enter \"-10.59\" instead of \"(10.59).\" However, if your software only allows for parentheses in entering negative amounts, you may use them.\\n\\nCurrent quarter\\'s adjustments.\\nIn certain cases, you must adjust the amounts you entered as social security and Medicare taxes in column 2 of lines 5a–5d to figure your correct tax liability for this quarter\\'s Form 941. See section 13 of Pub. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n7. Current quarter\\'s adjustment for fractions of cents.\\nEnter adjustments for fractions of cents (due to rounding) relating to the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes withheld. The employee share of amounts shown in column 2 of lines 5a–5d may differ slightly from amounts actually withheld from employees\\' pay due to the rounding of social security and Medicare taxes based on statutory rates. This adjustment may be a positive or a negative adjustment.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n8. Current quarter\\'s adjustment for sick pay.\\nEnter a negative adjustment for the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes that were withheld and deposited by your third-party sick pay payer with regard to sick pay paid by the third party. These wages should be included on line 5a, line 5c, and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 5d. If you’re the third-party sick pay payer, enter a negative adjustment for any employer share of these taxes required to be paid by the employer.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n9. Current quarter\\'s adjustments for tips and group-term life insurance.\\nEnter a negative adjustment for:\\n\\n\\n\\nAny uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on tips, and\\n\\n\\nThe uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on group-term life insurance premiums paid for former employees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPrior quarter\\'s adjustments.\\nIf you need to correct any adjustment reported on a previously filed Form 941, complete and file Form 941-X. Form 941-X is an adjusted return or claim for refund and is filed separately from Form 941. See section 13 of Pub. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n10.

Balance Due\\nIf line 12 is more than line 13, enter the difference on line 14. Otherwise, see Overpayment, later.\\nNever make an entry on both lines 14 and 15.\\nYou don\\'t have to pay if line 14 is under $1. Generally, you should have a balance due only if your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) for the current quarter or prior quarter are less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. However, see section 11 of Pub. 15 for information about payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule.\\nIf you were required to make federal tax deposits, pay the amount shown on line 14 by EFT. If you weren\\'t required to make federal tax deposits (see Must You Deposit Your Taxes, earlier) or you\\'re a monthly schedule depositor making a payment under the accuracy of deposits rule, you may pay the amount shown on line 14 by EFT, credit card, debit card, check, money order, or EFW. For more information on electronic payment options, go to IRS.gov/Payments.\\nIf you pay by EFT, credit card, or debit card, file your return using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, earlier, and don\\'t file Form 941-V, Payment Voucher.\\nIf you pay by check or money order, make it payable to \"United States Treasury.\" Enter your EIN, \"Form 941,\" and the tax period (\"1st Quarter 2020,\" \"2nd Quarter 2020,\" \"3rd Quarter 2020,\" or \"4th Quarter 2020\") on your check or money order. Complete Form 941-V and enclose with Form 941.\\nIf line 12 is $2,500 or more on both your prior and current quarter Form 941, and you’ve deposited all taxes when due, the balance due on line 14 should be zero, unless you’ve reduced your deposits in anticipation of filing a Form 941-X to claim COBRA premium assistance credits. See Depositing Your Taxes, earlier.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re required to make deposits and instead pay the taxes with Form 941, you may be subject to a penalty. See Must You Deposit Your Taxes, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat if you can\\'t pay in full?\\nIf you can\\'t pay the full amount of tax you owe, you can apply for an installment agreement online. You can apply for an installment agreement online if:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can\\'t pay the full amount shown on line 14,\\n\\n\\nThe total amount you owe is $25,000 or less, and\\n\\n\\nYou can pay the liability in full in 24 months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTo apply using the Online Payment Agreement Application, go to IRS.gov/OPA.\\nUnder an installment agreement, you can pay what you owe in monthly installments. There are certain conditions you must meet to enter into and maintain an installment agreement, such as paying the liability within 24 months, and making all required deposits and timely filing tax returns during the length of the agreement.\\nIf your installment agreement is accepted, you will be charged a fee and you will be subject to penalties and interest on the amount of tax not paid by the due date of the return.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n15. Overpayment\\nIf line 13 is more than line 12, enter the difference on line 15.\\nNever make an entry on both lines 14 and 15.\\nIf you deposited more than the correct amount for the quarter, you can choose to have the IRS either refund the overpayment or apply it to your next return. Check only one box on line 15. If you don\\'t check either box or if you check both boxes, generally we will apply the overpayment to your next return. Regardless of any boxes you check or don\\'t check on line 15, we may apply your overpayment to any past due tax account that is shown in our records under your EIN.\\nIf line 15 is under $1, we will send a refund or apply it to your next return only if you ask us in writing to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nComplete Both Pages\\nYou must complete both pages of Form 941 and sign on page 2. Failure to do so may delay processing of your return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart 2: Tell Us About Your Deposit Schedule and Tax Liability for This Quarter\\n\\n\\xa0\\n16. Tax Liability for the Quarter\\nCheck one of the boxes on line 16. Follow the instructions for each box to determine if you need to enter your monthly tax liability on Form 941 or your daily tax liability on Schedule B (Form 941).\\n\\nDe minimis exception.\\nIf line 12 is less than $2,500 or line 12 on the prior quarterly return was less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter, check the first box on line 16 and go to Part 3.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you meet the de minimis exception based on the prior quarter and line 12 for the current quarter is $100,000 or more, you must provide a record of your federal tax liability. If you’re a monthly schedule depositor, complete the deposit schedule on line 16. If you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, attach Schedule B (Form 941).\\n\\n\\nMonthly schedule depositor.\\nIf you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule discussed in section 11 of Pub. 15 applies. Check the second box on line 16 and enter your tax liability for each month in the quarter. Enter your tax liabilities in the month that corresponds to the dates you paid wages to your employees, not the date payroll liabilities were accrued or deposits were made. Add the amounts for each month. Enter the result in the \"Total liability for quarter\" box.\\nNote that your total tax liability for the quarter must equal your total taxes shown on line 12. If it doesn\\'t, your tax deposits and payments may not be counted as timely. Don\\'t change your tax liability on line 16 by adjustments reported on any Forms 941-X.\\nYou’re a monthly schedule depositor for the calendar year if the amount of your Form 941 taxes reported for the lookback period is $50,000 or less. The lookback period is the 4 consecutive quarters ending on June 30 of the prior year. For 2020, the lookback period begins July 1, 2018, and ends June 30, 2019. For details on the deposit rules, see section 11 of Pub. 15. If you filed Form 944 in either 2018 or 2019, your lookback period is the 2018 calendar year.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe amounts entered on line 16 are a summary of your monthly tax liability, not a summary of deposits you made. If you don\\'t properly report your liabilities when required or if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor and enter your liabilities on line 16 instead of on Schedule B (Form 941), you may be assessed an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. See Deposit Penalties in section 11 of Pub. 15 for more information.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReporting adjustments from lines 7–9 on line 16.\\nIf your net adjustment during a month is negative and it exceeds your total tax liability for the month, don\\'t enter a negative amount for the month. Instead, enter \"-0-\" for the month and carry over the unused portion of the adjustment to the next month. \\n\\n\\n\\nSemiweekly schedule depositor.\\nIf you reported more than $50,000 of taxes for the lookback period, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor. Check the third box on line 16.\\nYou must complete Schedule B (Form 941) and submit it with your Form 941. Don\\'t file Schedule B (Form 941) with your Form 941 if you’re a monthly schedule depositor.\\nDon\\'t change your tax liability on Schedule B (Form 941) by adjustments reported on any Forms 941-X.\\n\\n\\nAdjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities reported on line 11.\\nMonthly schedule depositors and semiweekly schedule depositors must account for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities (line 11) when reporting their tax liabilities on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941). The total tax liability for the quarter must equal the amount reported on line 12. Failure to account for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941) may cause line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941) to report more than the total tax liability reported on line 12.\\nThe qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities applies to the employer share of social security tax on wages paid in the quarter that begins after the income tax return electing the credit has been filed. In completing line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941), you take into account the payroll tax credit against the liability for the employer share of social security tax starting with the first payroll payment of the quarter that includes payments of wages subject to social security tax to your employees. The credit may be taken to the extent of the employer share of social security tax on wages associated with the first payroll payment, and then to the extent of the employer share of social security tax associated with succeeding payroll payments in the quarter until the credit is used. Don\\'t reduce your monthly tax liability reported on line 16 or your daily tax liability reported on Schedule B (Form 941) below zero. Consistent with the entries on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941), the payroll tax credit should be taken into account in making deposits of employment tax. If any payroll tax credit is remaining at the end of the quarter that has not been used completely because it exceeds the employer share of social security tax for the quarter, the excess credit may be carried forward to the succeeding quarter and allowed as a payroll tax credit for the succeeding quarter. The payroll tax credit may not be taken as a credit against income tax withholding, Medicare tax, or the employee share of social security tax. Also, the remaining payroll tax credit may not be carried back and taken as a credit against wages paid from preceding quarters.\\n\\nExample.\\nRose Co. is an employer with a calendar tax year that filed its timely income tax return on April 15, 2020. Rose Co. elected to take the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities on Form 6765. The third quarter of 2020 is the first quarter that begins after Rose Co. filed the income tax return making the payroll tax credit election. Therefore, the payroll tax credit applies against Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid to employees in the third quarter of 2020. Rose Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor. Rose Co. completes Schedule B (Form 941) by reducing the amount of liability entered for the first payroll payment in the third quarter of 2020 that includes wages subject to social security tax by the lesser of (1) its share of social security tax on the wages, or (2) the available payroll tax credit. If the payroll tax credit elected is more than Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on the first payroll payment of the quarter, the excess payroll tax credit would be carried forward to succeeding payroll payments in the third quarter until it is used. If the amount of the payroll tax credit exceeds Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid to its employees in the third quarter, the excess credit would be treated as a payroll tax credit against its share of social security tax on wages paid in the fourth quarter. If the amount of the payroll tax credit remaining exceeded Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid in the fourth quarter, it could be carried forward and treated as a payroll tax credit for the first quarter of 2021.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart 3: Tell Us About Your Business\\nIn Part 3, answer only those questions that apply to your business. If the questions don\\'t apply, leave them blank and go to Part 4.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n17. If Your Business Has Closed . . .\\nIf you go out of business or stop paying wages, you must file a final return. To tell the IRS that a particular Form 941 is your final return, check the box on line 17 and enter the final date you paid wages in the space provided. For additional filing requirements, see If Your Business Has Closed, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n18. If You’re a Seasonal Employer . . .\\nIf you hire employees seasonally—such as for summer or winter only—check the box on line 18. Checking the box tells the IRS not to expect four Forms 941 from you throughout the year because you haven\\'t paid wages regularly.\\nGenerally, we won\\'t ask about unfiled returns if at least one taxable return is filed each year. However, you must check the box on line 18 on every Form 941 you file. Otherwise, the IRS will expect a return to be filed for each quarter.\\nAlso, when you complete Form 941, be sure to check the box on the top of the form that corresponds to the quarter reported.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart 4: May We Speak With Your Third-Party Designee?\\nIf you want to allow an employee, a paid tax preparer, or another person to discuss your Form 941 with the IRS, check the \"Yes\" box in Part 4. Enter the name, phone number, and the five-digit personal identification number (PIN) of the specific person to speak with—not the name of the firm that prepared your tax return. The designee may choose any five numbers as his or her PIN.\\nBy checking \"Yes,\" you authorize the IRS to talk to the person you named (your designee) about any questions we may have while we process your return. You also authorize your designee to do all of the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nGive us any information that is missing from your return.\\n\\n\\nCall us for information about processing your return.\\n\\n\\nRespond to certain IRS notices that you’ve shared with your designee about math errors and return preparation. The IRS won\\'t send notices to your designee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou’re not authorizing your designee to bind you to anything (including additional tax liability) or to otherwise represent you before the IRS. If you want to expand your designee\\'s authorization, see Pub. 947.\\nThe authorization will automatically expire 1 year from the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing your Form 941. If you or your designee wants to terminate the authorization, write to the IRS office for your location using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart 5: Sign Here (Approved Roles)\\nComplete all information and sign Form 941. The following persons are authorized to sign the return for each type of business entity.\\n\\n\\n\\nSole proprietorship—The individual who owns the business.\\n\\n\\nCorporation (including a limited liability company (LLC) treated as a corporation)—The president, vice president, or other principal officer duly authorized to sign.\\n\\n\\nPartnership  (including an LLC treated as a partnership)  or unincorporated organization—A responsible and duly authorized partner, member, or officer having knowledge of its affairs.\\n\\n\\nSingle-member LLC treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes—The owner of the LLC or a principal officer duly authorized to sign.\\n\\n\\nTrust or estate—The fiduciary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm 941 may be signed by a duly authorized agent of the taxpayer if a valid power of attorney has been filed.\\n\\nAlternative signature method.\\nCorporate officers or duly authorized agents may sign Form 941 by rubber stamp, mechanical device, or computer software program. For details and required documentation, see Rev. Proc. 2005-39, 2005-28 I.R.B. 82, available at IRS.gov/irb/2005-28_IRB#RP-2005-39.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPaid Preparer Use Only\\nA paid preparer must sign Form 941 and provide the information in the Paid Preparer Use Only section of Part 5 if the preparer was paid to prepare Form 941 and isn\\'t an employee of the filing entity. Paid preparers must sign paper returns with a manual signature. The preparer must give you a copy of the return in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS.\\nIf you’re a paid preparer, enter your Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) in the space provided. Include your complete address. If you work for a firm, enter the firm\\'s name and the EIN of the firm. You can apply for a PTIN online or by filing Form W-12. For more information about applying for a PTIN online, go to IRS.gov/PTIN. You can\\'t use your PTIN in place of the EIN of the tax preparation firm.\\nGenerally, don\\'t complete this section if you’re filing the return as a reporting agent and have a valid Form 8655 on file with the IRS. However, a reporting agent must complete this section if the reporting agent offered legal advice, for example, advising the client on determining whether its workers are employees or independent contractors for federal tax purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow To Get Forms, Instructions, and Publications\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou can view, download, or print most of the forms, instructions, and publications you may need at IRS.gov/Forms. Otherwise, you can go to IRS.gov/OrderForms to place an order and have them mailed to you.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

La base salarial para la retención de la contribución al Seguro Social es $137,700.\\nLa tasa de la contribución al Medicare es 1.45% tanto para la parte del empleado como la parte del patrono, la misma tasa que correspondió para el año 2019. No hay límite sobre la cantidad de salarios sujetos a la contribución al Medicare.\\nLas contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare se aplican a los salarios de empleados domésticos a quienes usted les paga $2,200 o más en efectivo u otra forma de compensación equitativa en el año 2020. Las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare se aplican a los trabajadores electorales a quienes se les paga $1,900 o más en efectivo u otra forma equivalente de compensación en el año 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRecordatorios\\n\\nCrédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas.\\nPara los años contributivos que comienzan después de 2015, un pequeño negocio calificado puede optar por reclamar hasta $250,000 de su crédito por aumentar las actividades de investigación como un crédito de contribuciones de nómina contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono. El crédito contributivo sobre la nómina tiene que ser elegido en una planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos original que se radica oportunamente (incluyendo prórrogas). Se permite reclamar la parte del crédito utilizada contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono en el primer trimestre natural comenzando después de la fecha en que el pequeño negocio calificado radicó su planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos. La elección y la determinación de la cantidad del crédito que se utilizará contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono se hacen en el Formulario 6765, Credit for Increasing Research Activities (Crédito por aumentar las actividades investigativas), en inglés. La cantidad de la línea 44 del Formulario 6765 tiene que ser informada en el Formulario 8974, Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities (Crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas), en inglés. El Formulario 8974 se utiliza para determinar la cantidad del crédito que se puede utilizar en el trimestre actual. La cantidad de la línea 12 del Formulario 8974 se informa en la línea 11 del Formulario 941-PR. Si usted está reclamando el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina por las actividades investigativas en su Formulario 941-PR, tiene que adjuntar un Formulario 8974. Para más información sobre el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina, vea el Aviso 2017-23 que se encuentra en la página 1100 del Internal Revenue Bulletin (Boletín de Rentas Internas) 2017-16, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2017-16_IRB#NOT-2017-23 y  IRS.gov/ResearchPayrollTC. También vea Ajuste de la obligación contributiva para el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas declarado en la línea 11, más adelante.\\n\\n\\nPrograma de certificación para las organizaciones de patronos profesionales (PEO).\\nLa Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (Ley de Logro de una Mejor Calidad de Vida de 2014) requiere del  IRS establecer un programa de certificación voluntaria para las organizaciones de patronos profesionales (PEO, por sus siglas en inglés). Las PEO se encargan de manejar varias responsabilidades administrativas de la nómina y reportes de contribuciones de sus clientes de negocios y, por lo general, se les paga una tarifa basada en los costos de la nómina. Para certificarse y mantener la certificación conforme al programa de certificación, las organizaciones de patronos profesionales certificados (CPEO, por sus siglas en inglés) tienen que cumplir con varios requisitos descritos en las secciones 3511 y 7705 y las guías relacionadas que se han publicado. La certificación como una  CPEO puede afectar las obligaciones de contribuciones de nómina tanto de la CPEO como las de sus clientes. Por lo general, para propósitos de las contribuciones sobre la nómina, una CPEO es tratada como el patrono de cualquier individuo que realiza servicio para un cliente de la CPEO y es cubierto por un contrato descrito en la sección 7705(e)(2) entre la CPEO y el cliente (contrato de la CPEO), pero sólo para los salarios y otra compensación pagados a la persona por la CPEO. Para certificarte como una CPEO, la organización tiene que solicitar a través del IRS Online Registration System (Sistema de registro en línea del IRS), en inglés. Para más información o solicitar para certificarse como una CPEO, visite IRS.gov/CPEO. La información está disponible en inglés.\\nPor lo general, las CPEO tienen que radicar electrónicamente el Formulario 941-PR y el Schedule R (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers (Anexo R (Formulario 941), Registro de asignación para los declarantes de Formularios 941 agregados), en inglés. Para obtener más información sobre el requisito de una CPEO de radicar electrónicamente, vea el Revenue Procedure 2017-14 (Procedimiento Administrativo Contributivo 2017-14), en inglés. Puede ver dicho procedimiento en la página 426  del Internal Revenue Bulletin (I.R.B.) 2017-03 (Boletín de Rentas Internas 2017-03), en inglés, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.\\n\\n\\nExternalización de las obligaciones de nómina.\\nPor lo general, como patrono, usted es responsable por asegurarse que las planillas de contribución se radiquen y que los depósitos y pagos se efectúen, aun si usted contrata los servicios de un tercero para hacerlo. Usted sigue siendo el responsable aun si el tercero no cumple con la acción requerida. Antes de elegir por externalizar cualquier parte de su nómina y las obligaciones relacionadas con las contribuciones (es decir, retención, declaración y pago de las contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare y al fondo federal de desempleo (FUTA, por sus siglas en inglés)) a un tercero pagador, tal como un proveedor de servicios de nómina o agente de reportación, visite el sitio web IRS.gov/OutsourcingPayrollDuties para información útil sobre este tema. Dicha información está disponible en inglés. Si una CPEO paga los salarios y otra compensación de cualquier individuo que realiza servicio para un cliente de la CPEO y éste está cubierto por un contrato descrito en la sección 7705(e)(2) entre la CPEO y el cliente, la CPEO es tratada para propósitos de las contribuciones sobre la nómina, como el patrono de dicho empleado, pero sólo para salarios y otra compensación pagada al individuo por la CPEO. Sin embargo, con respecto a ciertos empleados cubiertos por un contrato de la CPEO, usted también puede ser tratado como un patrono de los empleados y, en consecuencia, también puede ser responsable de las contribuciones federales sobre los salarios y otra compensación pagada por la CPEO a dichos empleados. Para más información sobre los diferentes tipos de arreglos de terceros pagadores, vea el apartado 16 titulado Third Party Payer Arrangements (Arreglos de un tercero pagador) en la Pub. 15, en inglés.\\n\\n\\nDeclarantes de Formularios 941-PR agregados.\\nLos agentes y las CPEO tienen que completar el Schedule R (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers (Anexo R (Formulario 941), Registro de asignación para los declarantes de Formularios 941 agregados), en inglés, cuando radiquen un Formulario 941-PR agregado. Los Formularios 941-PR agregados son radicados por agentes de aquéllos quienes reciben servicios de cuidado en el hogar aprobados por el IRS conforme a la sección 3504. Para solicitar la aprobación para actuar como un agente para un empleador o patrono, el agente radica el Formulario 2678 con el IRS, a menos que usted sea una agencia del gobierno estatal o local que actúa como agente de acuerdo con los procedimientos especiales provistos en el Revenue Procedure 2013-39) (Procedimiento Administrativo Contributivo 2013-39) que aparece en la página 830 del Internal Revenue Bulletin 2013-52 (Boletín de Rentas Internas) 2013-52, en inglés, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39. Las CPEO aprobadas por el IRS conforme a la sección 7705 pueden radicar Formularios 941-PR agregados. Para ser una CPEO, la organización tiene que solicitar a través del IRS Online Registration System (Sistema de registro en línea del IRS), en inglés, visitando IRS.gov/CPEO. Las CPEO radican el Formulario 8973, Certified Professional Employer Organization/Customer Reporting Agreement (Organización de empresarios profesionales certificados/Acuerdo de radicación del cliente), en inglés, para notificar al IRS que comenzaron o terminaron un contrato de servicio con un cliente. Por lo general, las CPEO tienen que radicar el Formulario 941-PR y el Anexo R (Formulario 941) electrónicamente. Para obtener más información sobre el requisito de una CPEO de radicar electrónicamente, vea el Revenue Procedure 2017-14 (Procedimiento Administrativo Contributivo 2017-14), en inglés. Puede ver dicho procedimiento en la página 426 del Internal Revenue Bulletin (I.R.B.) 2017-03 (Boletín de Rentas Internas 2017-03), en inglés, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSi tanto un patrono como un agente autorizado conforme a la sección 3504, pagaron salarios a un empleado durante un trimestre, o si tanto un patrono como una CPEO pagaron salarios a un empleado durante un trimestre, tanto el patrono como el agente autorizado conforme a la sección 3504 (o la CPEO, si corresponde) tienen que radicar el Formulario 941-PR declarando los salarios que cada entidad pagó al empleado durante el trimestre correspondiente y emitir los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR declarando los salarios que cada entidad pagó al empleado durante el año.\\n\\nEl crédito contributivo por oportunidad de trabajo para organizaciones calificadas exentas de contribución que contratan a veteranos calificados.\\nLas organizaciones calificadas exentas de contribuciones que contratan veteranos desempleados que reúnen los requisitos pueden reclamar el crédito contributivo por oportunidad de trabajo contra su contribución sobre la nómina utilizando el Formulario 5884-C, Work Opportunity Credit for Qualified Tax-Exempt Organizations Hiring Qualified Veterans (Crédito por oportunidad de trabajo para organizaciones exentas de contribuciones calificadas que contratan a veteranos calificados), en inglés. Si desea más información, visite IRS.gov/WOTC y pulse sobre Español.\\n\\n\\nEl crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA.\\nEfectivo para los períodos contributivos comenzados después de 2013, no puede reclamar el crédito por pagos de asistencia para las primas de COBRA en el Formulario 941-PR.

Por lo general, una EFT se realiza mediante el Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (Sistema electrónico de pagos de la contribución federal o EFTPS, por sus siglas en inglés). Si usted no desea utilizar el EFTPS, puede hacer arreglos para que su preparador profesional, institución financiera, servicio de nóminas u otro tercero de confianza le haga los depósitos electrónicamente de parte de usted. También puede hacer arreglos para que su institución financiera inicie una transferencia electrónica realizada el mismo día de pago de parte de usted. El EFTPS es un servicio gratuito provisto por el Departamento del Tesoro. Podría verse obligado a pagar un cargo por los servicios de un preparador profesional, institución financiera, servicio de nómina u otro tercero.\\nPara más información sobre los depósitos de la contribución federal, vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179. Para obtener más información sobre el EFTPS o para inscribirse en el EFTPS, visite el sitio web EFTPS.gov o llame al Servicio al Cliente del EFTPS en español al 800-244-4829 o, si es usuario de equipo TDD, llame al 800-733-4829. Información adicional sobre el EFTPS está disponible en la Pub. 966(SP).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPara que un depósito efectuado por medio del EFTPS se considere hecho a su debido tiempo, tiene que transmitir el depósito a más tardar a las 8 p.m. horario del Este de los Estados Unidos el día anterior a la fecha de vencimiento para efectuar el depósito. Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para obtener más detalles.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOpción de pago el mismo día por medio de una transferencia electrónica.\\nSi no transmite una transacción de depósito en el EFTPS para las 8 p.m. horario del Este de los Estados Unidos el día anterior a la fecha de vencimiento para efectuar un depósito, todavía puede efectuar a tiempo su depósito por medio del Federal Tax Collection Service (Servicio de recaudación de la contribución federal o FTCS, por sus siglas en inglés) para efectuar un pago electrónico el mismo día. Para utilizar el método de pago efectuado el mismo día, tendrá que hacer los trámites con su institución financiera con anticipación. Por favor consulte con su institución financiera con respecto a la disponibilidad, los plazos y el costo. Su institución financiera puede cobrar un cargo por los pagos efectuados de esta manera. Para obtener más detalles sobre la información que necesita proveer a su institución financiera para poder efectuar un pago electrónico el mismo día, visite IRS.gov/SameDayWire y pulse sobre Español.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPuntualidad de los depósitos de la contribución federal.\\nSi se requiere que un depósito se efectúe en un día que no es un día laborable, se considera que dicho depósito se hace a tiempo si se hace para el cierre de operaciones comerciales del siguiente día laborable. Un \"día laborable\" es todo día que no sea sábado, domingo o día feriado oficial. El término \"día feriado oficial\" para propósitos de efectuar los depósitos únicamente incluye los días feriados oficiales en el Distrito de Columbia. Dichos días feriados oficiales se indican en el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179.\\n\\n\\nRadicación y pago por medios electrónicos.\\nLos negocios pueden disfrutar de los beneficios de radicar sus planillas de contribución y pagar sus contribuciones federales por medios electrónicos. No importa si depende de un preparador profesional o si usted mismo se ocupa de completar su planilla de contribución, el IRS ofrece programas convenientes para facilitar la radicación y el pago de las contribuciones. Pasará menos tiempo preocupándose de las contribuciones y más tiempo dedicándose a la operación de su negocio. Use la radicación electrónica (e-file) y el EFTPS, según le convenga:\\n\\n\\n\\nPara e-file, visite el sitio del IRS  en  IRS.gov/EmploymentEfile para más información en inglés.

Si no provee un EIN válido, la planilla o el pago no será tramitado. Esta acción puede resultar en multas. Visite Número de identificación patronal (EIN), más adelante, para más información.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRetiro electrónico de fondos (EFW).\\nSi radica el Formulario 941-PR electrónicamente, puede radicar (e-file) y usar EFW, (retiro electrónico de fondos) para pagar el saldo adeudado en un solo paso, usando programas de computadora (software) para la preparación de planillas o por medio de un preparador profesional de contribuciones. Sin embargo, no use el EFW para efectuar los depósitos de la contribución federal.

Dicha publicación explica los requisitos para la retención, el depósito y el pago de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Le explica sobre los formularios que tiene que darle a sus empleados, los formularios que sus empleados tienen que darle a usted y aquéllos que usted tiene que enviar al IRS. Vea la Pub. 15-A, en inglés, para obtener información especializada sobre las contribuciones sobre la nómina que complementa la información básica contenida en la Pub. 179 o visite el sitio web IRS.gov e ingrese \" employment taxes \" (contribuciones sobre la nómina) en el encasillado Search (Buscar). Dicha información está disponible en inglés.\\nLa ley federal requiere que usted, como patrono, les retenga ciertas contribuciones a los cheques de salario de sus empleados. Cada vez que paga salarios, tiene que retener —es decir, descontar de los cheques de salario de sus empleados— ciertas cantidades para pagar la contribución al Seguro Social y la contribución al Medicare. También tiene que retener la Contribución Adicional al Medicare de los salarios en exceso de $200,000 que le paga a un empleado en un año natural. De acuerdo con el sistema de la retención de contribuciones, estas mismas que se les retienen a sus empleados se acreditarán en sus cuentas del Seguro Social para pagar sus obligaciones contributivas correspondientes.\\nLa ley federal también requiere que usted pague toda obligación resultante de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare correspondientes al patrono. No se les retiene esta parte de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare a los empleados.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuién tiene que radicar el Formulario 941-PR\\nPor lo general, tiene que radicar una planilla para el primer trimestre en el cual usted paga salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare, y para cada trimestre de allí en adelante hasta que usted radique una planilla final. Use el Formulario 941-PR si el lugar principal donde desempeña sus actividades comerciales está en Puerto Rico o si tiene empleados que están sujetos a la retención de la contribución sobre los ingresos de Puerto Rico.\\nUse el Formulario 941-PR para declarar las siguientes cantidades:\\n\\n\\n\\nSalarios que ha pagado sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare.\\n\\n\\nPropinas que sus empleados han recibido sujetas a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare.\\n\\n\\nLas partes correspondientes al patrono y al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare.\\n\\n\\nContribución Adicional al Medicare retenida de los empleados.\\n\\n\\nAjustes hechos en el trimestre en curso a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare por fracciones de centavos, pagos por enfermedad, propinas y seguro de vida colectivo a término fijo.\\n\\n\\nCrédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNo use el Formulario 941-PR si tiene tanto a empleados que están sujetos a la retención de la contribución federal sobre ingresos de los Estados Unidos como a empleados que no están sujetos a la retención de la contribución federal sobre ingresos de los Estados Unidos. En su lugar, tiene que radicar sólo el Formulario 941 (o Formulario 944 (SP)) e incluir todos los salarios de sus empleados en ese formulario. Tampoco, use el Formulario 941-PR para declarar las contribuciones de desempleo. Use el Formulario 940-PR, Planilla para la Declaración Federal Anual del Patrono de la Contribución Federal para el Desempleo (FUTA) para declarar las contribuciones de desempleo.\\nTiene que radicar una planilla cada trimestre aunque no haya tenido ninguna obligación contributiva que declarar, a no ser que radique una planilla final o le corresponda una de las Excepciones, a continuación.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExcepciones\\nReglas especiales le corresponden a ciertos patronos:\\n\\n\\n\\nSi recibió una notificación que le informa que tiene que radicar el Formulario 944(SP), tiene que radicar el Formulario 944(SP) anualmente no radique el Formulario 941-PR trimestralmente.\\n\\n\\nLos patronos estacionales no tienen que radicar el Formulario 941-PR para los trimestres durante los cuales no han tenido una obligación contributiva debido a que no han pagado salarios. Para notificarle al IRS que no va a radicar una planilla por uno o más trimestres del año, marque el encasillado que aparece en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-PR en cada trimestre que radica dicho formulario. Por lo general, el IRS no le preguntará sobre planillas que no han sido radicadas si por lo menos una planilla en la cual se indica una obligación contributiva es radicada cada año. No obstante, tiene que marcar el encasillado en la línea 18 en cada planilla trimestral que radique. De otra manera, el IRS anticipará que radicará una planilla para cada trimestre.\\n\\n\\nLos patronos de empleados domésticos normalmente no radican el Formulario 941-PR. Vea la Pub. 179, el Anexo H-PR (Formulario 1040-PR), Contribuciones sobre el Empleo de Empleados Domésticos, sus instrucciones por separado y la Pub. 926, ésta última en inglés.\\n\\n\\nLos patronos de empleados agrícolas no radican el Formulario 941-PR por salarios pagados por trabajo agrícola. Consulte el Formulario 943-PR, Planilla para la Declaración Anual de la Contribución Federal del Patrono de Empleados Agrícolas, la Pub. 179 y la Pub. 51, ésta última en inglés.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSi ninguna de las excepciones anteriores le corresponde y no ha radicado una planilla final, usted tiene que radicar el Formulario 941-PR cada trimestre aunque no haya pagado salarios durante el trimestre.

Para solicitar la radicación de los Formularios 941-PR trimestrales para declarar sus contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare para el año natural 2020, tiene que llamar al IRS al 800-829-4933, entre el 1 de enero de 2020 y el 1 de abril de 2020, o enviar una solicitud por escrito con fecha de matasellos del correo, entre el 1 de enero de 2020 y el 16 de marzo de 2020. Después de comunicarse con el IRS, el mismo le enviará una notificación por escrito de que su requisito de radicación ha cambiado a los Formularios 941-PR. Usted tiene que recibir una notificación por escrito del IRS antes de radicar los Formularios 941-PR en lugar del Formulario 944(SP). Si no recibe dicha notificación, usted tiene que radicar el Formulario 944(SP) para el año natural 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\nSolicitud para radicar el Formulario 944(SP) en lugar de los Formularios 941-PR.\\nSi tiene que radicar los Formularios 941-PR pero cree que sus contribuciones sobre la nómina para el año natural 2020 serán de $1,000 o menos, puede hacer una solicitud para poder radicar el Formulario 944(SP) en lugar de los Formularios 941-PR.

Declare únicamente los salarios que usted mismo pagó.\\nCuando se consolidan dos empresas, la empresa que continúa en vigor tiene que radicar un Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre en el cual ocurrió la fusión y la otra empresa tiene que radicar una planilla final.\\nCuando la clasificación de un negocio cambia a otra, tal como un negocio de un solo dueño que se convierte en una sociedad colectiva (partnership) o en una corporación, se considera este tipo de cambio una transferencia. Si ocurre una transferencia, quizás tenga que obtener un número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés) nuevo. Vea la Pub.1635, en inglés, y el apartado 3 de la Pub. 179 para más detalles.\\nAsegúrese de adjuntar una declaración que incluya lo siguiente:\\n\\n\\n\\nEl nombre del nuevo dueño (o el nombre nuevo de la empresa);\\n\\n\\nSi la empresa actualmente es un negocio propio, sociedad colectiva (partnership) o corporación (sociedad anónima);\\n\\n\\nLa clase de cambio que se efectuó (venta o transferencia);\\n\\n\\nLa fecha en la cual se efectuó el cambio; y\\n\\n\\nEl nombre del individuo que lleva los archivos de la nómina y la dirección donde se guardarán tales archivos.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSi cierra su negocio...\\n\\n\\n\\nSi cierra su negocio o deja de pagar salarios a sus empleados, tiene que radicar una planilla final.

Vea las Instrucciones para el Anexo D (Formulario 941) a fin de determinar si debe radicar el Anexo D (Formulario 941) y cuándo debe radicarlo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPlanilla final\\nSi cierra su negocio o si deja de pagar salarios a sus empleados, tiene que radicar una planilla final. Para notificarle al IRS que el Formulario 941-PR para un trimestre particular es su planilla final, marque el encasillado en la línea 17 y anote la última fecha en que pagó salarios. También adjunte una declaración a su planilla que indique el nombre de la persona que se quedará con los archivos o récords correspondientes a la nómina y la dirección en donde permanecerán. Comuníquese con el Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico para obtener información sobre cuándo debe entregarles a sus empleados el Formulario 499R-2/W-2PR que corresponda al año natural en que ocurrió el cierre.

Si hace depósitos a su debido tiempo y paga las contribuciones trimestrales en su totalidad, puede radicar para el décimo día del segundo mes siguiente al final del trimestre. Por ejemplo, si usted hizo depósitos a su debido tiempo en su totalidad durante el primer trimestre, puede radicar el Formulario 941-PR el 10 de mayo.\\nSi recibimos el Formulario 941-PR después de la fecha de vencimiento, lo trataremos como si fuera radicado a tiempo si el sobre que contiene el Formulario 941-PR está debidamente rotulado, tiene suficiente franqueo y el matasellos del Servicio Postal de los EE.UU. está fechado a más tardar en la fecha de vencimiento, o si se envió por medio de un servicio de entrega privado (PDS, por sus siglas en inglés) aceptado por el IRS a más tardar en la fecha de vencimiento. Si no sigue estas pautas, generalmente consideramos que el Formulario 941-PR fue radicado en la fecha en que realmente se recibió.

También anote su nombre y su EIN en la parte superior de la segunda página. No use su número de Seguro Social (SSN, por sus siglas en inglés) ni su número de identificación personal del contribuyente (ITIN, por sus siglas en inglés). Por lo general, anotará el nombre comercial (legal) que usó al solicitar su EIN. Por ejemplo, si es dueño único de su negocio, anotará \"Roberto Herrera\" en la línea que dice \"Nombre\" y \"Bicicletas Roberto\" donde dice \"Nombre comercial\". Deje en blanco la línea \"Nombre comercial\" si este nombre es igual al \"Nombre\" de usted.\\nSi utiliza un preparador remunerado para completar el Formulario 941-PR, asegúrese de que el preparador muestre su nombre comercial exactamente como apareció cuando solicitó su EIN.\\n\\nNúmero de identificación patronal (EIN).\\nPara asegurar que los negocios cumplan con las leyes federales de la contribución, el IRS se ocupa de controlar los pagos de contribución mediante el uso de un sistema de números para identificar a los contribuyentes. El número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés) es un número especial y singular que consta de nueve dígitos que el IRS les expide a todas las corporaciones y sociedades colectivas, así como a algunos negocios de un solo dueño. Todo negocio que tenga que obtener un EIN tiene que solicitar este número y anotarlo en toda planilla, pago o informe de contribución mientras esté en operación.\\nSu negocio debe tener solamente un EIN. Si tiene más de un número y no está seguro del número que debe usar, escriba a la oficina del IRS donde suele radicar sus planillas de contribución (la dirección que usa cuando envía planillas \"Sin un pago\", bajo Adónde deberá enviar la planilla, más adelante), o llame al IRS al 800-829-4933.\\nSi usted no tiene un EIN, puede solicitar uno en línea visite el sitio web del IRS en IRS.gov/EIN y pulse sobre Español. También puede solicitar un EIN enviando el Formulario SS-4(PR), Solicitud de Número de Identificación Patronal (EIN), al IRS por fax o por correo. Si usted no ha recibido su EIN antes de la fecha de vencimiento del Formulario 941-PR, escriba \" Applied For \" (Solicitado) y la fecha en que solicitó el EIN en el espacio correspondiente.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSi usted radica su planilla de contribución electrónicamente, un EIN válido se requiere en el momento de radicar su planilla. Si no provee un EIN válido, la planilla no será aceptada. Esto puede resultar en multas.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAsegúrese siempre que el EIN que aparezca en el formulario que radica sea exactamente igual al EIN que el IRS le designó a su negocio. No use su SSN o ITIN en ninguna planilla que pida un EIN. La radicación de un Formulario 941-PR con un EIN incorrecto o el uso de un EIN que pertenece a otro negocio puede resultar en multas y demoras en la tramitación de su planilla.\\n\\n\\nSi cambia su nombre comercial, dirección comercial o parte responsable...\\nNotifíquele al IRS inmediatamente si cambia el nombre comercial, dirección comercial o parte responsable. \\n\\n\\n\\nEscriba a la oficina del IRS donde usted radica sus planillas (utilizando la dirección \"Sin un pago\", que se encuentra bajo Adónde deberá enviar la planilla, más adelante) para notificarle al IRS sobre todo cambio de nombre comercial. Vea la Pub. 1635, en inglés, para determinar si necesita solicitar un nuevo EIN.\\n\\n\\nComplete y envíe por correo el Formulario 8822-B, en inglés, para notificarle al IRS sobre un cambio en la dirección comercial o parte responsable. No envíe el Formulario 8822-B junto con el Formulario 941-PR. Si desea ver la definición de \"parte responsable\", vea las Instrucciones para el Formulario SS-4PR.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMarque el encasillado para el trimestre\\nDebajo de Informe para este trimestre de 2020 en la parte superior del Formulario 941-PR, marque el encasillado del trimestre para el cual radica esta planilla. Asegúrese que el trimestre en cuestión sea el mismo que aparece en todo Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), Registro de la Obligación Contributiva para los Depositantes de Itinerario Bisemanal, que usted adjunte.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCómo completar y radicar el Formulario 941-PR\\nAnote las partidas en el Formulario 941-PR tal como se indica a continuación para evitar problemas con su tramitación:\\n\\n\\n\\nUse letra de imprenta de fuente Courier de 10 puntos (si es posible) para cada anotación que escriba a maquinilla o con computadora para completar su formulario. Los formularios en formato de documento portátil (PDF, por sus siglas en inglés) en IRS.gov tienen campos editables con especificaciones de fuentes aceptables.\\n\\n\\nOmita el signo de dólares y puntos decimales.

Para obtener información, vea el tema Los depósitos de la contribución federal tienen que efectuarse por transferencia electrónica de fondos (EFT) bajo Recordatorios.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n¿Tiene que depositar sus contribuciones?\\nPuede estar obligado a depositar tanto la contribución al Seguro Social como al Medicare correspondientes al patrono y al empleado.\\n\\n\\n\\nSi el total de sus contribuciones después de considerar los ajustes y créditos (línea 12) es menos de $2,500 para el trimestre en curso o el trimestre anterior y usted no tuvo una obligación de depositar $100,000 el próximo día durante el trimestre en curso. No tiene que hacer un depósito. Para evitar una multa, tiene que pagar la cantidad en su totalidad con una planilla radicada a su debido tiempo o tiene que depositar la cantidad oportunamente. Para más información sobre cómo pagar junto con una planilla radicada a tiempo, vea las instrucciones de la línea 14, más adelante. Si no está seguro si su obligación total por pagar para el trimestre en curso será menos de $2,500 (y su obligación para el trimestre anterior no fue menos de $2,500), haga los depósitos según las reglas del itinerario mensual o bisemanal para evitar multas por no depositar (FTD).\\n\\n\\nSi el total de sus contribuciones después de considerar los ajustes y créditos (línea 12) es $2,500 o más para el trimestre en curso y el trimestre anterior. Tiene que hacer depósitos conforme a su itinerario de depósitos. Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para la información sobre los pagos efectuados de acuerdo a la regla de la exactitud de los depósitos y para las reglas sobre los depósitos de la contribución federal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUsted puede reducir los depósitos durante el trimestre por la cantidad del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA que se reflejarán en su Formulario 941-X (PR), pero sólo si utiliza el proceso de reclamación y no el proceso de ajuste para reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA en el Formulario 941-X (PR) para el trimestre.\\nEl crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA se considera como un crédito en el primer día del período de su planilla (es decir, 1 de enero, 1 de abril, 1 de julio o 1 de octubre). Sin embargo, debido a que el crédito ahora se reclama en el Formulario 941-X (PR) radicado después de la radicación del Formulario 941-PR, un patrono que reduzca sus depósitos requeridos en anticipación del crédito recibirá un aviso generado por el sistema reflejando un saldo adeudado y multas asociadas e intereses, si es aplicable. El saldo adeudado, así como las multas e intereses correspondientes resultantes de la reducción de los depósitos con anticipación del crédito serán reducidas cuando se aplique el crédito. Tal reducción generalmente ocurrirá sin ninguna otra acción de parte del patrono.\\nComo alternativa, para evitar que se reciba un aviso de saldo adeudado generado por el sistema, el patrono puede efectuar sus depósitos sin considerar la reducción en la obligación debido a la anticipación del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA, y luego puede seguir los procedimientos para radicar una reclamación para un reembolso o ajuste en la planilla utilizando el Formulario 941-X (PR).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n¿Cuándo tiene que depositar sus contribuciones?\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine si es depositante de itinerario mensual o bisemanal para el trimestre\\n\\n\\n\\nEl IRS usa dos clases de reglas de depósito para determinar cuándo los negocios tienen que depositar sus contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Esos itinerarios le informarán cuándo debe hacer un depósito después de un día de pago.\\nSu itinerario de depósitos no se determina por la frecuencia en que le paga a sus empleados. Su itinerario de depósitos depende del total de la obligación contributiva que declaró en el Formulario 941-PR durante el período retroactivo de los 4 trimestres anteriores (desde el 1 de julio del segundo año natural anterior (penúltimo año) hasta el 30 de junio del año natural pasado). Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para más detalles. Si radicó el Formulario 944(SP) en 2018 ó 2019, su período retroactivo es el año natural 2018.\\nAntes del comienzo de cada año natural, tiene que determinar cuál de los itinerarios de depósitos tiene que usar.\\n\\n\\n\\nSi declaró $50,000 o menos por concepto de contribuciones durante el período retroactivo, usted es depositante de itinerario mensual.\\n\\n\\nSi declaró más de $50,000 por concepto de contribuciones durante el período retroactivo, usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSi usted es depositante de itinerario mensual y acumula $100,000 o más por concepto de contribuciones en cualquier día durante el período de depósito, entonces se convierte en depositante de itinerario bisemanal en el próximo día y por el resto del año natural y el año siguiente. Vea la Regla de depositar $100,000 el próximo día en el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para más información.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n¿Qué hay que saber acerca de las multas e intereses?\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCómo evitar el pago de multas e intereses\\nPuede evitar el pago de multas e intereses si hace todo lo indicado a continuación:\\n\\n\\n\\nDeposita o paga las contribuciones cuando se debe hacer.\\n\\n\\nRadica a su debido tiempo su Formulario 941-PR debidamente completado.\\n\\n\\nDeclara correctamente su obligación contributiva.\\n\\n\\nEntrega cheques válidos para el pago de las contribuciones.\\n\\n\\nEntrega los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR correctos a sus empleados.\\n\\n\\nRadica el Formulario W-3PR junto a los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR ante la SSA a su debido tiempo y sin errores.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSe cobran multas e intereses sobre las contribuciones pagadas fuera de plazo y sobre las planillas radicadas fuera de plazo a una tasa fijada conforme a la ley. Vea los apartados 11 y 12 de la Pub. 179 para más detalles.\\nUse el Formulario 843, en inglés, para solicitar un reembolso o reducción en los intereses o multas que le han sido tasados. No solicite la reducción de multas o intereses en los Formularios 941-PR o 941-X (PR).\\nSi recibe una notificación de multas después de que haya radicado esta planilla, responda a la notificación con una explicación y determinaremos si cumple el criterio de lo que se considera ser causas razonables. No adjunte dicha explicación cuando radique su planilla.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSi las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare que se tienen que retener (es decir, contribuciones al fondo fiduciario) no se retienen, no se depositan o no se pagan al Tesoro de los Estados Unidos, se le podría imponer una multa por recuperación del fondo fiduciario. La multa es del 100% de la contribución al fondo fiduciario adeudada. Si estas contribuciones no pagadas no se le pueden cobrar inmediatamente al patrono o al negocio, la multa por recuperación del fondo fiduciario puede ser impuesta a las personas que el IRS determine que son responsables del cobro, de la contabilidad o del pago por estas contribuciones y que intencionalmente no lo hacen. Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para más información.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAjuste a la contribución sobre las propinas\\nSi, para el día 10 del mes siguiente al mes en que recibió la declaración de propinas del empleado, no tiene suficientes fondos del empleado para retener la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare, entonces ya no tendrá que recaudarlas. Declare la cantidad de las propinas en su totalidad en las líneas 5b (Propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social), 5c (Salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al  Medicare) y, si cumple con la cantidad del límite superior, en la línea 5d (Salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al  Medicare  ). Incluya en la línea 9, por concepto de un ajuste negativo, el total de la parte no recaudada correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n¿Dónde puede obtener formularios?\\nVea la Pub. 179 para obtener información sobre cómo pedir formularios del IRS por teléfono, por correo o por Internet. También puede obtener algunos de los formularios del IRS en la dirección indicada a continuación:\\nInternal Revenue Service\\nCity View Plaza II Bldg.\\n48 Carr. 165 km. 1.2\\nGuaynabo, PR 00968-8000\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRetención de la contribución federal sobre los ingresos\\nEn el caso de un empleado que es ciudadano de los Estados Unidos y que trabaja para un patrono que no sea el gobierno de los Estados Unidos o alguna de sus agencias, no hay que retener la contribución federal sobre los ingresos de los salarios pagados a dicho empleado si el patrono está obligado a retener la contribución sobre ingresos de Puerto Rico en conformidad con sus leyes o cuando es razonable creer que tal empleado será, durante todo el año natural, residente bona fide de Puerto Rico. No obstante, si un patrono tiene un empleado en Puerto Rico que es ciudadano de los Estados Unidos y de cuyos salarios no se exige la retención de la contribución sobre los ingresos de acuerdo con la ley de Puerto Rico, y si tal empleado no piensa adquirir residencia bona fide en Puerto Rico por todo el año natural, dicho patrono está obligado a retener la contribución federal sobre los ingresos de los salarios pagados al mencionado empleado. En casos como éste, el patrono debe consultar con la oficina del IRS en Guaynabo.\\nUse el Formulario 941, en inglés, en lugar del Formulario 941-PR si tiene que retener la contribución federal sobre los ingresos de los salarios pagados a sus empleados. Puede obtener los formularios necesarios y las instrucciones pertinentes en la oficina en Guaynabo o descargándolos del sitio web del IRS en IRS.gov/Forms.

Salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social.\\nAnote aquí el total de los salarios, compensación por enfermedad y beneficios marginales sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social que pagó a sus empleados durante el trimestre. Para este propósito, la compensación por enfermedad incluye los pagos hechos a sus empleados por una compañía de seguros y por los cuales usted fue notificado oportunamente por dicha compañía de seguros. Vea el apartado 6 de la Pub. 15-A, en inglés, para más información sobre la declaración de la compensación por enfermedad.\\nAnote la cantidad antes de descontar las deducciones de nómina. No incluya propinas en esta línea. Para más información sobre los tipos de salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social, vea el apartado 5 de la Pub. 179.\\nLa tasa para 2020 de la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios sujetos a contribución es 6.2% (0.062) correspondiente tanto al patrono como al empleado, o sea, 12.4% (0.124) para los dos. Deje de pagar y de declarar la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios de un empleado en la línea 5a cuando los salarios sujetos a contribución (incluyendo las propinas) del empleado alcancen $137,700 para el año. Sin embargo, siga reteniéndole la contribución al Medicare para todo el año sobre los salarios y propinas aun cuando se haya alcanzado la base salarial para la contribución al Seguro Social de $137,700.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlínea 5a\\n(columna 1)\\n\\n\\nx 0.124\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nlínea 5a\\n(columna 2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n5b.

Incluya todas las propinas que sus empleados le hayan declarado aun cuando no haya podido retenerle la contribución correspondiente al empleado del 6.2%. Reducirá su total de contribuciones por la cantidad de la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare no retenidas sobre las propinas, discutido más adelante en la línea 9; vea Ajustes por propinas y por seguro de vida colectivo a término fijo del trimestre, más adelante. No incluya cargos por servicios en la línea 5b. Para más detalles sobre la diferencia entre propinas y cargos por servicio, vea Revenue Ruling 2012-18 (Resolución administrativa contributiva 2012-18) que aparece en la página 1032 del I.R.B. 2012-26, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18.\\nSu empleado tiene que declararle las propinas en efectivo para el día 10 del mes siguiente al mes en que recibió dichas propinas. Las propinas en efectivo incluyen propinas pagadas en efectivo, cheque, tarjeta de débito y tarjeta de crédito. El informe debe incluir propinas cargadas (por ejemplo, cargos de las tarjetas de crédito y débito) que usted le pagó a los empleados por pagos provenientes de tarjetas de crédito de los clientes, propinas que el empleado recibió directamente de los clientes y propinas que recibió de otros empleados bajo cualquier acuerdo de propinas compartidas. Los empleados que reciben propinas directamente e indirectamente tienen que declararle las propinas al patrono. No se requiere declarar las propinas para meses en que las propinas sumen menos de $20. Los empleados pueden usar el Formulario 4070-PR (disponible solamente en la Pub. 1244-PR), o cualquier declaración por escrito o informe electrónico de propinas recibidas.\\nNo incluya las propinas asignadas en esta línea. En vez de incluirlas aquí, declárelas en el Formulario 8027, en inglés.

Salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare.\\nAnote el total de los salarios, propinas, pagos por enfermedad y beneficios marginales sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Se le requiere que comience la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare en el período de pago en el que le paga a un empleado un salario de más de $200,000 y después continuar la retención en cada período de pago hasta el final del año natural. La Contribución Adicional al Medicare sólo le corresponde al empleado. No hay ninguna Contribución Adicional al Medicare que le corresponda a la parte del patrono. Todos los salarios que están sujetos a la contribución al Medicare están sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare si éstos se pagan en exceso del límite de $200,000.\\nPara más información sobre qué salarios están sujetos a la contribución al Medicare, vea la tabla titulada Reglas especiales para varias clases de servicios y de pagos en el apartado 15 de la Pub.179. Para más información sobre la Contribución Adicional al Medicare, visite el sitio web IRS.gov/ADMT y pulse sobre Español.\\nCuando los salarios y propinas exceden el límite superior de la retención de $200,000, tiene que incluir todas las propinas que sus empleados le hayan declarado durante el trimestre, aun cuando no haya podido retenerles la parte de la contribución correspondiente a los empleados de 0.9% (0.009).\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlínea 5d\\n(columna 1)\\n\\n\\nx 0.009\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nlínea 5d\\n(columna 2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n5e.

Notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q): Contribución adeudada por propinas no declaradas\\nAnote el saldo de contribución adeudado que aparece en el Notice and Demand under Section 3121(q) (Notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q)), en inglés, en la línea 5f. El IRS emite esta notificación para informarle a un patrono de la cantidad de propinas recibidas por empleados que no fueron declaradas o que fueron declaradas de menos al patrono. El patrono no es responsable de pagar la parte correspondiente del patrono de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare por las propinas no declaradas hasta que el IRS le emita una notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q) a dicho patrono. La contribución adeudada pudo haber sido determinada calculando las propinas declaradas al IRS en el Formulario 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income (Contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare sobre el ingreso de propinas no declaradas), en inglés, del empleado, u otras propinas que el IRS determinó que no fueron declaradas al patrono después de una revisión. Para obtener más información, vea el Revenue Ruling 2012-18 (Resolución administrativa contributiva 2012-18) que aparece en la página 1032 del I.R.B. 2012-26, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18.\\nDeposite la contribución dentro del período requerido que le corresponde a su itinerario de depósito para evitar cualquier multa. La contribución se tratará como acumulada por el patrono en la parte titulada Date of Notice and Demand (Fecha de notificación y solicitud), en inglés, la cual está impresa en la notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q). El patrono tiene que incluir esta cantidad en la línea apropiada del formulario que corresponde a la obligación contributiva federal (la Parte 2 del Formulario 941-PR para un depositante de itinerario mensual o en el Anexo B del Formulario 941-PR para un depositante de itinerario bisemanal).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n6. Total de contribuciones antes de ajustes\\nSume el total de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare antes de tomar en cuenta los ajustes (línea 5e) y toda contribución adeudada de la notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q) declarada en la línea 5f. Anote el resultado en la línea 6.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n7–9. Ajustes a la contribución\\nAnote en las líneas 7 a 9 las cantidades de contribución que resultaron por un ajuste del trimestre en curso. Use el signo de menos (si es posible) para indicar un ajuste que disminuya las contribuciones totales anotadas en la línea 6 en vez de usar paréntesis. Esto mejora la veracidad de los programas de computadoras (software) para escanear que utiliza el IRS. Por ejemplo, declare \"-10.59\" en vez de \"(10.59)\". Sin embargo, si su programa de computadora sólo permite el uso de los paréntesis para declarar cantidades negativas, puede usarlos.\\n\\nAjustes del trimestre en curso.\\nEn ciertos casos, tendrá que ajustar las cantidades declaradas como contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare en la columna 2 de las líneas 5a a 5d para poder determinar su obligación contributiva correcta en el Formulario 941-PR para este trimestre. Vea el apartado 12 de la Pub. 179.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n7. Ajustes por fracciones de centavos del trimestre actual.\\nAnote los ajustes por fracciones de centavos (debido al redondeo de las cifras) que tienen que ver con la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare retenidas. La parte correspondiente al empleado de las cantidades indicadas en la columna 2 de las líneas 5a a 5d puede diferir un poco de las cantidades realmente retenidas de los pagos de sus empleados debido al redondeo de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare que ocurrió al aplicar las tasas estatutarias. Este ajuste puede ser un ajuste positivo o negativo.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n8. Ajustes por compensación por enfermedad del trimestre actual.\\nAnote un ajuste negativo por la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al seguro Medicare retenidas y pagadas por su tercero pagador de compensación por enfermedad con respecto a toda la compensación por enfermedad pagada por el tercero pagador. Estos salarios deben ser incluidos en la línea 5a y la línea 5c y, si cumple con la cantidad del límite superior, en la línea 5d. Si usted es el tercero pagador de compensación por enfermedad, anote un ajuste negativo de la parte correspondiente al patrono de estas contribuciones que se requiere ser pagado por el patrono.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n9. Ajustes por propinas y por seguro de vida colectivo a término fijo del trimestre actual.\\nAnote un ajuste negativo por:\\n\\n\\n\\nLa parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare no retenidas sobre las propinas y\\n\\n\\nLa parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare no retenidas sobre las primas del seguro de vida colectivo a término fijo pagadas para sus\\n\\tex empleados.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAjustes de trimestres anteriores.\\nSi necesita corregir un ajuste declarado en un Formulario 941-PR radicado previamente, complete y radique el Formulario 941-X (PR).

Si usted es un depositante de itinerario mensual, complete el resumen de su obligación contributiva mensual que se encuentra en la línea 16 del Formulario 941-PR. Si usted es un depositante de itinerario bisemanal, adjunte el Anexo B del Formulario 941-PR.\\n\\nDepositante de itinerario mensual.\\nSi declaró $50,000 o menos por concepto de contribuciones durante el período retroactivo, usted es depositante de itinerario mensual a menos que le corresponda la Regla de depositar $100,000 el próximo día que se explica en el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179. Marque el segundo encasillado en la línea 16 y anote su obligación contributiva para cada mes del trimestre. Anote su obligación contributiva en el mes correspondiente en las fechas que pagó salarios a sus empleados, no la fecha que la obligación de nómina fue acumulada o los depósitos fueron efectuados. Sume las cantidades para cada mes. Anote el resultado en el encasillado Total para el trimestre.\\nTenga presente que su obligación contributiva total para el trimestre tiene que ser igual al total de las contribuciones indicadas en la línea 12. Si no es así, se podría considerar que sus depósitos y pagos no fueron hechos oportunamente. No cambie su obligación contributiva en la línea 16 por ajustes declarados en todo Formulario 941-X (PR).\\nUsted es depositante de itinerario mensual para el año natural si las contribuciones que aparecen en su Formulario 941-PR declaradas para el período retroactivo son $50,000 o menos. El período retroactivo consta de los 4 trimestres consecutivos que terminan el 30 de junio del año anterior. En el caso del año 2020, el período retroactivo comienza el 1 de julio de 2018 y termina el 30 de junio de 2019. Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para más detalles sobre las reglas de depósito. Si radicó el Formulario 944(SP) en 2018 ó 2019, su período retroactivo natural 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLas cantidades declaradas en la línea 16 son un resumen de su obligación contributiva mensual y no es un resumen o registro de los depósitos que efectuó. Si no declara correctamente sus obligaciones cuando se le requiere hacerlo o si es depositante de itinerario bisemanal y declara sus obligaciones en la línea 16 en lugar del Anexo B del Formulario 941-PR, se le podría imponer una multa “promediada” por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés). Vea el tema titulado  Multas relacionadas con los depósitos  en el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para más información.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCómo declarar ajustes de las líneas 7–9 en la línea 16.\\nSi su ajuste neto para algún mes es negativo y el mismo excede la obligación contributiva total para el mes, no anote la cantidad en forma negativa para el mes.

Marque el tercer encasillado en la línea 16.\\n\\nTiene que completar el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) y adjuntarlo al radicar el Formulario 941-PR. No radique Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) con su Formulario 941-PR si es depositante de itinerario mensual.\\nNo cambie su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) por ajustes declarados en todo Formulario 941-X (PR).\\n\\n\\n\\nAjuste de la obligación contributiva para el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas declarado en la línea 11.\\nDepositantes de itinerario mensual y depositantes de itinerario bisemanal tienen que tomar en cuenta el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas (línea 11) al declarar sus obligaciones contributivas en la línea 16 o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR). El total de la obligación contributiva del trimestre tiene que ser igual a la cantidad declarada en la línea 12. Si no se tiene en cuenta el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas en la línea 16 o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), puede causar que declare más en la línea 16 o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) que el total de la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea 12.\\nEl crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas se aplica contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios pagados correspondiente al patrono en el primer trimestre natural comenzando después de la fecha en que el pequeño negocio calificado radicó su planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos. Para completar la línea 16 o el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), usted tiene que tomar en cuenta el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina contra la obligación de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono comenzando con el primer pago de nómina para el trimestre que incluye los pagos de salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social de sus empleados. El crédito puede ser utilizado contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono sobre salarios asociados con el primer pago de nómina, y luego contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono sobre salarios asociados con pagos de nómina sucesivos en el trimestre hasta que el crédito sea utilizado. No disminuya la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea 16 o su obligación contributiva diaria en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) por debajo de cero. De acuerdo con las entradas en la línea 16  o el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina se debe tener en cuenta al hacer los depósitos de las contribuciones sobre la nómina. Si se mantiene algún crédito contributivo sobre la nómina al final del trimestre que no se ha utilizado completamente porque excede la parte correspondiente al patrono de la contribución al Seguro Social para el trimestre, el crédito en exceso puede ser transferido al trimestre siguiente y permitido como un crédito contributivo sobre la nómina para el trimestre siguiente. El crédito contributivo sobre la nómina no se puede utilizar como un crédito contra la retención de la contribución federal sobre ingresos, la contribución al Medicare o la parte del empleado de la contribución al Seguro Social. Además, el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina restante no puede ser devuelto y tomado como crédito contra salarios pagados de trimestres anteriores.\\n\\nEjemplo.\\nRosa Co. es un patrono con un año natural contributivo que radicó oportunamente su planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos el 15 de abril de 2020. Rosa Co. eligió tomar en el Formulario 6765 el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas. El tercer trimestre de 2020 es el primer trimestre que comienza después de que Rosa Co. radicó la planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos haciendo la elección del crédito contributivo sobre la nómina. Por lo tanto, el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina se aplica contra la parte de Rosa Co. en la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios pagados a los empleados en el tercer trimestre de 2020. Rosa Co. es un depositante de itinerario bisemanal. Rosa Co. completa el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) reduciendo la cantidad de la obligación contributiva anotada para el primer pago de la nómina en el tercer trimestre de 2020 que incluye los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social por el menor de (1) su parte de la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios o (2) el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina disponible. Si el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina elegido es más que la parte de Rosa Co. en la contribución al Seguro Social en el primer pago de la nómina del trimestre, el crédito contributivo en exceso sobre la nómina se trasladaría a los pagos sobre la nómina sucesivos en el tercer trimestre, hasta que sea utilizado. Si la cantidad del crédito contributivo sobre la nómina excede la parte de Rosa Co. en la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios pagados a sus empleados en el tercer trimestre, el exceso de crédito se trataría como un crédito contributivo contra su parte a la contribución al Seguro Social sobre salarios pagados en el cuarto trimestre. Si la cantidad restante del crédito contributivo sobre la nómina superó la parte de Rosa Co. en la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios pagados en el cuarto trimestre, podría ser transferida y ser tratada como un crédito contributivo sobre la nómina para el primer trimestre de 2021.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nParte 3: Infórmenos sobre su negocio\\nEn la Parte 3, conteste únicamente aquellas preguntas que le correspondan a su negocio. Si alguna pregunta no le corresponde, déjela en blanco y pase a la Parte 4.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n17. Si su negocio ha dejado de operar . . .\\nSi su negocio ha dejado de operar o si ha dejado de pagar salarios, tiene que radicar una planilla final.

Si es patrono estacional . . .\\nSi contrata a empleados estacionales —por ejemplo, sólo para el verano o el invierno— marque el encasillado de la línea 18. El marcar el encasillado le indica al IRS que no anticipe recibir los cuatro Formularios 941-PR de usted durante el año porque no ha pagado salarios con regularidad.\\nPor lo general, no le solicitaremos información sobre planillas no radicadas si al menos una planilla sujeta a contribuciones es radicada cada año. Sin embargo, tiene que marcar el encasillado de la línea 18 en cada Formulario 941-PR que radique. De lo contrario, el IRS esperará que se radique una planilla para cada trimestre.\\nAdemás, al completar el Formulario 941-PR, asegúrese de marcar el encasillado de la parte superior de la planilla que corresponde al trimestre en que declara salarios.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nParte 4: ¿Podemos comunicarnos con su tercero autorizado?\\nSi desea autorizar a algún empleado suyo, a un preparador remunerado o a otro individuo para que éste hable sobre su Formulario 941-PR con el IRS, marque el encasillado Sí en la Parte 4. Anote el nombre, número de teléfono y los cinco dígitos del número de identificación personal (PIN, por sus siglas en inglés) del individuo específico con quien podamos hablar —no el nombre de la empresa que preparó su planilla de contribución. La persona designada puede elegir cualesquier cinco dígitos para su PIN.\\nAl marcar el encasillado Sí, usted le autoriza al IRS para que hable con el tercero designado a fin de hacerle preguntas que nos surjan al tramitar su planilla de contribución. Además, le permite a la persona designada que haga todo lo siguiente:\\n\\n\\n\\nFacilitarnos toda información no incluida en su planilla.\\n\\n\\nLlamarnos para obtener información relacionada con la tramitación de su planilla.\\n\\n\\nResponder a ciertas notificaciones del IRS que usted haya compartido con su tercero designado relacionadas con errores matemáticos y con la preparación de su planilla.

Revised: 01/2017      Instrucciones para el  Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) - Introductory Material    Acontecimientos Futuros Para obtener la información más reciente sobre los acontecimientos relacionados al Anexo B y sus instrucciones, como legislación promulgada después de que dichos documentos se hayan publicado, visite IRS.gov/form941pr.     Qué Hay de Nuevo  Ajuste de la obligación contributiva para el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas.  Tiene que reportar cualquier crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas que declaró en la línea 11 del  Formulario 941-PR, cuando radique su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B.  La obligación total para el trimestre tiene que ser igual a la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR. Si no reporta la cantidad declarada en la línea 11 del Formulario 941-PR, puede causar que la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR sea menos que la obligación total declarada en el Anexo B. No reduzca la obligación contributiva declarada en el Anexo B a una cantidad menor que cero.       Recordatorios  Declaración de ajustes hechos a períodos anteriores.  Los ajustes hechos a períodos anteriores se declaran en el Formulario 941-X (PR), Ajuste a la Declaración Federal TRIMESTRAL del Patrono o Reclamación de Reembolso, o en el Formulario 944-X (SP), Ajuste a la Declaración Federal ANUAL del Empleador o Reclamación de Reembolso, y no se toman en cuenta al calcular la obligación contributiva para el período en curso. Cuando radique un Anexo B con el Formulario 941-PR, no cambie su obligación contributiva por ajustes declarados en ningún Formulario 941-X (PR), o 944-X (SP).    Anexo B enmendado.  Si se le ha impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés), quizás pueda radicar un Anexo B enmendado. Consulte el tema Cómo Corregir la Obligación Contributiva que se ha Declarado Anteriormente, más adelante.      Instrucciones Generales    Propósito del Anexo B Estas instrucciones explican el Anexo B. Para determinar si es depositante bisemanal, visite IRS.gov y escriba \"depositante de itinerario bisemanal\" en el encasillado Search (Buscar). También consulte la Publicación 179, Guía Contributiva Federal para Patronos Puertorriqueños, o la Publicación 15, Employer\\'s Tax Guide (Guía contributiva para los patronos), en inglés. La ley federal requiere que usted, como patrono, les retenga ciertas contribuciones a los cheques de salario de sus empleados. Cada vez que paga salarios, tiene que retener —es decir, descontar de los cheques de salario de sus empleados— ciertas cantidades para pagar la contribución al Seguro Social y la contribución al Medicare. También tiene que retener la Contribución Adicional al Medicare de los salarios en exceso de $200,000 que le paga a un empleado en un año natural. De acuerdo con el sistema de la retención de contribuciones, estas mismas que se les retienen a sus empleados se acreditarán en sus cuentas del Seguro Social para pagar sus obligaciones contributivas correspondientes. La ley federal también requiere que los patronos paguen toda obligación de la parte de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare que les corresponde. No se les retiene a los empleados esta parte de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Indique su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B para cada día. Incluya las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare del patrono y del empleado. No use el Anexo B para declarar depósitos de la contribución federal. El Servicio Federal de Rentas Internas (IRS, por sus siglas en inglés) obtiene toda la información relacionada con los depósitos mediante el retiro electrónico de fondos.    El IRS usa el Anexo B para determinar si usted ha depositado a tiempo sus obligaciones contributivas federales sobre la nómina. Si no llena y radica correctamente su Anexo B junto con el Formulario 941-PR, el IRS podrá proponer una multa FTD\"promediada\". Vea Multas relacionadas con los depósitos, en el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información.     ¿Quién Tiene Que Radicar el Anexo B? Radique el Anexo B si usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal. Usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal si sus contribuciones del período retroactivo ascienden a más de $50,000 o acumula una obligación contributiva de $100,000 o más en cualquier día del año natural en curso o el previo. Vea el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información.    No complete el Anexo B si tiene una obligación contributiva menor de $2,500 durante el trimestre.     ¿Cuándo Tiene Que Radicar? El Anexo B acompaña al Formulario 941-PR, Planilla para la Declaración Federal TRIMESTRAL del Patrono. Por lo tanto, la fecha de vencimiento del Anexo B es la misma fecha de vencimiento del Formulario 941-PR correspondiente. No radique el Anexo B como documento adjunto al Formulario 944(SP), Declaración Federal ANUAL de Impuestos del Patrono o Empleador. En vez de eso, si es depositante de itinerario bisemanal que tiene que radicar un registro de la obligación contributiva con el Formulario 944(SP), use el Formulario 943A-PR, Registro de la Obligación Contributiva Federal del Patrono Agrícola, o el Formulario 945-A, Annual Record of Federal Tax Liability (Registro anual de la obligación de impuestos federales), en inglés.    Instrucciones Específicas    Cómo Completar el Anexo B    Provea la Información de su Negocio Escriba su número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés) y su nombre en la parte superior del anexo. Asegúrese de que los mismos correspondan exactamente al nombre del negocio y al EIN que el IRS le asignó y también concuerden con el nombre y el EIN indicados en el Formulario 941-PR adjunto.     Año Natural Anote el año natural que corresponde al trimestre seleccionado.     Marque el Recuadro para el Trimestre Marque en la parte superior del Anexo B, bajo Informe para este trimeste, el recuadro apropiado del trimestre para el cual radica este anexo. Asegúrese de que el trimestre marcado en la parte superior del Anexo B corresponda exactamente al trimestre marcado en su Formulario 941-PR.     Anote su Obligación Contributiva para cada Mes El Anexo B se divide en los 3 meses que constituyen un trimestre típico de un año. Cada mes tiene 31 espacios enumerados que corresponden a las fechas de un mes típico. Anote sus obligaciones contributivas en los espacios que corresponden a las fechas en las cuales pagó salarios a sus empleados, y no en la fecha en la que se hicieron los depósitos correspondientes a la nómina. Por ejemplo, si su período de nómina terminó el 31 de diciembre de 2016 y pagó los salarios correspondientes a tal período el 6 de enero de 2017, usted:   Comenzaría con el Mes 1 (porque enero es el primer mes del trimestre) y Anotaría la obligación contributiva correspondiente en la línea 6 (porque la línea 6 representa el sexto día del mes).       Asegúrese de que marcó el recuadro apropiado en la Parte 2 del Formulario 941-PR para indicar que usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal.     Obligación Total para el Trimestre Para determinar su obligación total para el trimestre, sume sus obligaciones contributivas de cada mes.            Obligación Contributiva del Mes 1     + Obligación Contributiva del Mes 2     +  Obligación Contributiva del Mes 3        Obligación Contributiva Total del Trimestre            Su obligación total para el trimestre tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR.      Ejemplo 1. El Patrono A es depositante de itinerario bisemanal que paga los salarios mensuales el último día del mes. El 24 de diciembre de 2017, el Patrono A también pagó a sus empleados las bonificaciones de fin de año (sujetas a las contribuciones sobre la nómina). Debido a que el Patrono A es depositante de itinerario bisemanal, el mismo tiene que informar sus obligaciones para las contribuciones sobre la nómina en el Anexo B. Para el cuarto trimestre (octubre, noviembre y diciembre), el Patrono A tiene que declarar su obligación contributiva de la manera siguiente:           Mes   Líneas de las fechas en las que se pagaron salarios          1 (octubre) línea 31 (día de pago, último día del mes)   2 (noviembre) línea 30 (día de pago, último día del mes)   3 (diciembre)  línea 24 (bonificaciones pagadas el 24 de diciembre de 2017)    3 (diciembre) línea 31 (día de pago, último día del mes)              Ejemplo 2. El Patrono B es un depositante de itinerario bisemanal que paga los salarios a sus empleados cada viernes alterno. El Patrono B acumuló una obligación de contribuciones sobre la nómina de $20,000 en cada una de las siguientes fechas de pago: 01/06/17, 01/20/17, 02/03/17, 02/17/17, 03/03/17, 03/17/17 y 03/31/17. Ya que el Patrono B es depositante de itinerario bisemanal, el Patrono B tiene que declarar su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B de la manera siguiente:           Mes   Líneas de las fechas en las que se pagaron salarios          1 (enero) líneas 6 y 20    2 (febrero) líneas 3 y 17    3 (marzo)  líneas 3, 17 y 31               Ejemplo 3. El Patrono C tiene un negocio nuevo y es depositante de itinerario mensual para 2017. El Patrono C paga los salarios a sus empleados todos los viernes y ha acumulado una obligación contributiva sobre la nómina de $2,000 el 01/13/17. El 01/20/17, y cada uno de los viernes subsiguientes durante 2017, el Patrono C acumuló una obligación contributiva sobre la nómina de $110,000. De acuerdo con las reglas de depósito, los patronos se convierten en depositantes de itinerario bisemanal el día después de cualquier día en el que acumulan $100,000 o más por concepto de obligación contributiva sobre la nómina durante un período de depósito. El Patrono C acumuló $112,000 el 01/20/17, el mismo se convirtió en depositante de itinerario bisemanal el día siguiente (01/21/17). Vea el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información. El Patrono C tiene que completar el Anexo B y radicarlo junto con el Formulario 941-PR como se muestra abajo.            Mes   Fechas en las cuales se pagaron los salarios   Cantidad que se debe declarar              1 (enero)  línea 13  $2,000     1 (enero)  líneas 20 y 27  $110,000     2 (febrero)  líneas 3, 10, 17 y 24  $110,000     3 (marzo)  líneas 3, 10, 17, 24 y 31  $110,000                       Cómo Corregir la Obligación Contributiva que se ha Declarado Anteriormente  Depositantes de itinerario bisemanal.  Si se le ha impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) correspondiente a un trimestre y cometió un error en el Anexo B y la corrección no cambiará el total de la obligación contributiva para el trimestre que declaró en el Anexo B, quizás pueda reducir la multa si radica un Anexo B corregido.    Ejemplo. Usted declaró $3,000 de obligación contributiva el día 1 del mes 1. Sin embargo, la obligación contributiva realmente corresponde al mes 3. Prepare un Anexo B enmendado que indique los $3,000 de obligación contributiva en el día 1 del mes 3. Además, tiene que anotar las obligaciones contributivas que había declarado anteriormente para el trimestre que no cambiaron. Escriba \"Enmendado\" en la parte superior del Anexo B. El IRS volverá a calcular la multa y le notificará de todo cambio a la multa.   Depositantes de itinerario mensual.  Los depositantes de itinerario mensual pueden radicar un Anexo B si se les ha impuesto una multa FTD correspondiente a un trimestre y cometieron un error en la parte para contribuciones mensuales del Formulario 941-PR. Cuando complete el Anexo B, debe anotar los totales mensuales porque no se requieren las anotaciones diarias.    Dónde debe radicar.  Radique su Anexo B enmendado en la dirección indicada en la notificación que recibió sobre la multa. No tiene que incluir el Anexo B original.      Formulario 941-X (PR)  Reducción en las contribuciones.  Si va a radicar un Formulario 941-X (PR) correspondiente a un trimestre, puede radicar el Anexo B enmendado junto con el Formulario 941-X (PR) si las dos condiciones siguientes le corresponden:  Tiene una reducción en las contribuciones. Le impusieron una multa FTD.    Radique su Anexo B enmendado junto con el Formulario 941-X (PR). La obligación contributiva total para el trimestre declarada en su Anexo B corregido tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de contribuciones corregida declarada en el Formulario 941-X (PR). Si su multa se reduce, el IRS incluirá la reducción de la multa junto con su reducción en las contribuciones.    Aumento en las contribuciones — Formulario941-X (PR) radicado a tiempo.  Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) a tiempo, no radique un Anexo B enmendado, a menos que se le haya impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) debido a un Anexo B que falta (que no ha sido radicado anteriormente), que está incorrecto o que está incompleto. No incluya la cantidad de aumento en la contribución declarada en el Formulario 941-X (PR) en ningún Anexo B enmendado que usted radique.    Aumento en las contribuciones — Formulario941-X (PR) radicado fuera de plazo.  Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) fuera de plazo, o sea, después de la fecha de vencimiento para el trimestre en el que usted descubrió el error, tiene que radicar un Anexo B enmendado con el Formulario 941-X (PR). De otro modo, el IRS podría tasarle una multa \"promediada\" por no depositar. El total de la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea Obligación total para el trimestre del Anexo B enmendado tiene que ser igual a la cantidad total de contribuciones (línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR (línea 10 para trimestres que terminaron antes del 1 de enero de 2017) combinado con cualquier corrección declarada en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.      El Formulario 941-X (PR) será revisado en abril de 2017. Si utiliza la revisión de abril de 2017, la contribución total declarada en la línea Obligación total para el trimestre del Anexo B tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de la contribución corregida (línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR (línea 10 para trimestres que terminaron antes del 1 de enero de 2017) combinada con toda corrección declarada en la línea 19 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.

       " '   Instructions for Schedule B (Form 941) (01/2017) Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule Depositors  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 01/2017      Instructions for Schedule B (Form 941) - Introductory Material    Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Schedule B and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/form941.     What’s New  Adjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities.  You must account for any qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities that you reported on Form 941 or Form 941-SS, line 11, when reporting your liabilities on Schedule B. The total liability for the quarter must equal Form 941 or Form 941-SS, line 12. Failure to account for the amount reported on Form 941 or Form 941-SS, line 11, may cause Form 941 or Form 941-SS, line 12, to be less than the total tax liability reported on Schedule B. Don\\'t reduce tax liability reported on Schedule B below zero.       Reminders  Reporting prior period adjustments.  Prior period adjustments are reported on Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, or Form 944-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, and aren’t taken into account when figuring the tax liability for the current quarter. When you file Schedule B with your Form 941 (or Form 941-SS), don’t change your tax liability by adjustments reported on any Form 941-X or 944-X.    Amended Schedule B.  If you have been assessed a failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalty, you may be able to file an amended Schedule B. See Correcting Previously Reported Tax Liability, later.      General Instructions    Purpose of Schedule B These instructions tell you about Schedule B. To determine if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, visit IRS.gov and type \"semiweekly depositor\" in the search box. Also see Pub. 15, Employer\\'s Tax Guide, or Pub. 80, Federal Tax Guide for Employers in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Federal law requires you, as an employer, to withhold certain taxes from your employees’ pay. Each time you pay wages, you must withhold - or take out of your employees’ pay - certain amounts for federal income tax, social security tax, and Medicare tax. You must also withhold Additional Medicare Tax from wages you pay to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. Under the withholding system, taxes withheld from your employees are credited to your employees in payment of their tax liabilities.  Federal law also requires employers to pay any liability for the employer\\'s portion of social security and Medicare taxes. This portion of social security and Medicare taxes isn’t withheld from employees. On Schedule B, list your tax liability for each day. Your liability includes:  The federal income tax you withheld from your employees\\'   pay, and Both employee and employer social security and Medicare   taxes.    Don’t use the Schedule B to show federal tax deposits. The IRS gets deposit data from electronic funds transfers.    The IRS uses Schedule B to determine if you’ve deposited your federal employment tax liabilities on time. If you don’t properly complete and file your Schedule B with Form 941 or Form 941-SS, the IRS may propose an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. See Deposit Penalties in section 11 of Pub. 15 for more information.     Who Must File?  File Schedule B if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor. You’re a semiweekly depositor if you reported more than $50,000 of employment taxes in the lookback period or accumulated a tax liability of $100,000 or more on any given day in the current or prior calendar year. See section 11 of Pub. 15 for more information.    Don’t complete Schedule B if you have a tax liability that is less than $2,500 during the quarter.     When Must You File? Schedule B is filed with Form 941, Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, or Form 941-SS, Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Therefore, the due date of Schedule B is the same as the due date for the applicable Form 941 or Form 941-SS. Don’t file Schedule B as an attachment to Form 944, Employer\\'s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return. Instead, if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor that is required to file a report of tax liability with Form 944, use Form 945-A, Annual Record of Federal Tax Liability.    Specific Instructions    Completing Schedule B    Enter Your Business Information Carefully enter your employer identification number (EIN) and name at the top of the schedule. Make sure that they exactly match the name of your business and the EIN that the IRS assigned to your business and also agree with the name and EIN shown on the attached Form 941 or Form 941-SS.     Calendar Year Enter the calendar year that applies to the quarter checked.      Check the Box for the Quarter Under Report for this Quarter at the top of Schedule B, check the appropriate box of the quarter for which you’re filing this schedule. Make sure the quarter checked on the top of the Schedule B matches the quarter checked on your Form 941 or Form 941-SS.     Enter Your Tax Liability by Month Schedule B is divided into the 3 months that make up a quarter of a year. Each month has 31 numbered spaces that correspond to the dates of a typical month. Enter your tax liabilities in the spaces that correspond to the dates you paid wages to your employees, not the date payroll deposits were made. For example, if your payroll period ended on December 31, 2016, and you paid the wages for that period on January 6, 2017, you would:  Go to Month 1 (because January is the first month of the   quarter), and Enter your tax liability on line 6 (because line 6 represents   the sixth day of the month).       Make sure you have checked the appropriate box in Part 2 of Form 941 or Form 941-SS to show that you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.      Total Liability for the Quarter To find your total liability for the quarter, add your monthly tax liabilities.            Tax Liability for Month 1       +Tax Liability for Month 2        +Tax Liability for Month 3         Total Liability for the Quarter            Your total liability for the quarter must equal line 12 on Form 941 or Form 941-SS.        Example 1. Employer A is a semiweekly schedule depositor who pays wages for each month on the last day of the month. On December 24, 2017, Employer A also paid its employees year-end bonuses (subject to employment taxes). Employer A must report employment tax liabilities on Schedule B for the 4th quarter (October, November, December), as follows.           Month   Lines for dates wages were paid    1 (October) line 31 (pay day, last day of the month)   2 (November) line 30 (pay day, last day of the month)   3 (December) line 24 (bonus paid December 24, 2017)   3 (December)  line 31 (pay day, last day of the month)          Example 2. Employer B is a semiweekly schedule depositor who pays employees every other Friday. Employer B accumulated a $20,000 employment tax liability on each of these pay dates: 01/06/17, 01/20/17, 02/03/17, 02/17/17, 03/03/17, 03/17/17, and 03/31/17. Employer B must report employment tax liabilities on Schedule B as follows.           Month   Lines for dates wages were paid    1 (January) lines 6 and 20   2 (February) lines 3 and 17   3 (March)  lines 3, 17, and 31          Example 3. Employer C is a new business and monthly schedule depositor for 2017. Employer C paid wages every Friday and accumulated a $2,000 employment tax liability on 01/13/17. On 01/20/17, and on every subsequent Friday during 2017, Employer C accumulated a $110,000 employment tax liability. Under the deposit rules, employers become semiweekly schedule depositors on the day after any day they accumulate $100,000 or more of employment tax liability in a deposit period. Employer C became a semiweekly schedule depositor on 01/21/17, because Employer C had a total accumulated employment tax liability of $112,000 on 01/20/17. For more information, see section 11 of Pub. 15 or section 8 of Pub. 80. Employer C must complete Schedule B as shown below and file it with Form 941 or 941-SS.             Month   Lines for dates wages were paid   Amount to report    1 (January) line 13 $2,000     1 (January) lines 20, 27 $110,000     2 (February) lines 3, 10, 17, and 24 $110,000     3 (March) lines 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31 $110,000             Correcting Previously Reported Tax Liability  Semiweekly schedule depositors.  If you’ve been assessed an FTD penalty for a quarter and you made an error on Schedule B and the correction won’t change the total liability for the quarter you reported on Schedule B, you may be able to reduce your penalty by filing a corrected Schedule B.    Example. You reported a liability of $3,000 on day 1 of month 1. However, the liability was actually for month 3. Prepare an amended Schedule B showing the $3,000 liability on day 1 of month 3. Also, you must enter the liabilities previously reported for the quarter that didn’t change. Write \"Amended\" at the top of Schedule B. The IRS will refigure the penalty and notify you of any change in the penalty.   Monthly schedule depositors.  You can file a Schedule B if you have been assessed an FTD penalty for a quarter and you made an error on the monthly tax liability section of Form 941. When completing Schedule B, only enter the monthly totals. The daily entries aren’t required.    Where to file.  File your amended Schedule B at the address provided in the penalty notice you received. You don’t have to submit your original Schedule B.       Form 941-X  Tax decrease.  If you’re filing Form 941-X for a quarter, you can file an amended Schedule B with Form 941-X if both of the following apply.  You have a tax decrease. You were assessed an FTD penalty.  File your amended Schedule B with Form 941-X. The total liability for the quarter reported on your corrected Schedule B must equal the corrected amount of tax reported on Form 941-X. If your penalty is decreased, the IRS will include the penalty decrease with your tax decrease.    Tax increase — Form 941-X filed timely.  If you’re filing a timely Form 941-X, don’t file an amended Schedule B, unless you were assessed an FTD penalty caused by an incorrect, incomplete, or missing Schedule B. If you’re filing an amended Schedule B, don’t include the tax increase reported on Form 941-X.    Tax increase — Form 941-X filed late.  If you owe tax and are filing a late Form 941-X, that is, after the due date of the return for the return period in which you discovered the error, you must file an amended Schedule B with Form 941-X. Otherwise, the IRS may assess an \"averaged\" FTD penalty.   The total tax reported on the \"Total liability for the quarter\" line of the amended Schedule B must match the corrected tax (Form 941, line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017), combined with any correction reported on Form 941-X, line 18) for the quarter, less any previous abatements and interest-free tax assessments.     Form 941-X will be revised in April 2017. If you are using the April 2017 revision, the total tax reported on the \"Total liability for the quarter\" line of the amended Schedule B must match the corrected tax (Form 941, line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017), combined with any correction reported on Form 941-X, line 19) for the quarter, less any previous abatements and interest-free tax assessments.

       " '   Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) (06/2011) Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 06/2011     General Instructions    Understanding Schedule D (Form 941) These instructions tell you about Schedule D (Form 941), Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations. Employers can use Schedule D (Form 941), to explain certain discrepancies (caused by acquisitions, statutory mergers, and consolidations) between Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (Copy A), and Forms 941, Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, for the totals of social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance earned income credit (EIC) payments (for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).    What Is Schedule D (Form 941)? Each year the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) compare the totals on your Forms 941 with the totals from your Forms W-2 (Copy A), to verify the following.  The wages you reported on Forms 941 match those you reported on Forms W-2 (Copy A) so that your employees\\' social security earnings records are complete for benefit purposes. You have paid the appropriate taxes.    Generally, the totals of all your Forms W-2 (Copy A) should equal the aggregate quarterly totals you reported on Forms 941. Use Schedule D (Form 941) if discrepancies exist between the totals you reported on those forms only as a result of an acquisition, statutory merger, or consolidation.    IRS uses Schedule D (Form 941) to determine if you have reported your wages and tax liabilities correctly. In many cases, the information on Schedule D (Form 941) helps the IRS resolve discrepancies without contacting you.     Who Should File Schedule D (Form 941)? You do not need to file a Schedule D (Form 941) for every merger, acquisition, or other reorganization that occurs. File Schedule D (Form 941) only for those acquisitions, statutory mergers or consolidations that create discrepancies between Forms W-2 (Copy A) and Forms 941 in the totals of:  Social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, Social security tips, Federal income tax withheld, and Advance EIC payments (for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).        Each party to an applicable transaction (see below) files its own Schedule D (Form 941).    File Schedule D (Form 941) for:    A statutory merger, A consolidation, or An acquisition for which you are using the alternate procedure under Rev. Proc. 2004-53. See Rev. Proc. 2004-53, 2004-34 I.R.B. 320, available at  www.irs.gov/irb/2004–34_IRB/ar13.html.        Do NOT file a Schedule D for:    An acquisition for which you are using the standard procedure under Rev. Proc. 2004-53, or An acquisition that is not a statutory merger or consolidation and that does not qualify under the predecessor-successor rules. See Acquisitions that Qualify Under Predecessor-Successor Rules, on page 2, for a complete discussion of the predecessor-successor rules.        Types of Mergers and Acquisitions Mergers, acquisitions, and other reorganizations generally fall into one of three categories for purposes of reporting employment taxes.  Statutory mergers and consolidations. Acquisitions that qualify under the predecessor-successor rules (see Acquisitions that Qualify Under Predecessor-Successor Rules on page 2). Other acquisitions that are not statutory mergers or consolidations and that do not qualify under the predecessor-successor rules (see Acquisitions that Qualify Under the Predecessor-Successor Rules on  page 2).        Statutory Mergers and Consolidations If you are the surviving corporation after a statutory merger or consolidation, you should file Schedule D (Form 941) to provide:  The date of the statutory merger or consolidation; The name, trade name (doing business as or d/b/a), address, and employer identification number (EIN) of the acquired corporation; and An explanation of any discrepancies between Forms W-2 (Copy A) and Forms 941 in the totals of social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance EIC payments (only for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).    If you are the acquired corporation after a statutory merger or consolidation and you are filing a final Form 941, you should file Schedule D (Form 941) to provide:  The date of the statutory merger or consolidation; The name, trade name (doing business as or d/b/a), address, and EIN of the surviving corporation; and An explanation of any discrepancies between Forms W-2 (Copy A) and Forms 941 in the totals of social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance EIC payments (only for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).    Rev. Rul. 62-60, 1962-1 C.B. 186, provides that, for employment tax purposes, the \"resultant\" corporation (now called a \"surviving\" corporation) resulting from a statutory merger or consolidation is the same employer and taxpayer as the \"absorbed\" corporation (now called an \"acquired\" corporation). The predecessor-successor rules described in Rev. Proc. 2004-53 do not apply to these transactions. However, Rev. Proc. 2004-53 provides guidance for using Schedule D (Form 941) by a surviving corporation or an acquired corporation to report information after a statutory merger or consolidation only where there is a discrepancy. If the surviving corporation completes and files Schedule D (Form 941) to explain discrepancies between the totals on Forms W-2 (Copy A) and the totals on Forms 941, filing Schedule D (Form 941) will also provide notice of a statutory merger or consolidation under Rev. Rul. 62-60.     Acquisitions that Qualify Under the Predecessor-Successor Rules Acquisitions that qualify under the predecessor-successor rules are acquisitions in which a successor employer:  Acquires substantially all the property used in a trade or business of another employer (predecessor) or in a separate unit of a trade or business of a predecessor, and In connection with and directly after the acquisition (but during the same calendar year) employs individuals who immediately before the acquisition were employed in the trade or business of the predecessor.    These acquisitions satisfy the conditions for predecessor-successor status set forth in section 3121(a)(1) and Regulations section 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b). Rev. Proc. 2004-53 contains the rules that apply to employment tax reporting in a predecessor-successor situation. Two procedures can be used in an acquisition that qualifies as a predecessor-successor situation.   Standard procedure—Do not file Schedule D (Form 941). No discrepancies should exist between the totals of the Forms W-2 (Copy A) and the totals of the Forms 941 as a result of the acquisition.  Alternate procedure—Each party in the transaction should file Schedule D (Form 941). Forms W-2 (Copy A) filed by the successor may include amounts reported on Forms 941 filed by the predecessor.        Other Acquisitions If you completed other acquisitions that are not statutory mergers or consolidations and that do not qualify under the predecessor-successor rules, no discrepancies should exist as a result of the acquisition. Rev. Rul. 62-60 and Rev. Proc. 2004-53 do not apply to such transactions. Do not file Schedule D (Form 941) for such transactions.      When Should You File? If your business is continuing to operate, you should file Schedule D (Form 941) with your Form 941 no later than the due date of your Form 941 for the first quarter of the year after the calendar year of the transaction. If your business is not continuing to operate, you should file Schedule D (Form 941) with your final Form 941. For example, if the transaction occurred in the third quarter of 2010 and your business is continuing to operate, you would file Schedule D (Form 941) with your Form 941 no later than the due date for the first quarter of 2011. However, if your business is not continuing to operate during 2010, you would file Schedule D (Form 941) with your final Form 941 no later than the due date for the third quarter of 2010.     How Should You File? Schedule D (Form 941) was designed to be filed electronically with your electronic submission of Form 941. Electronic filing of Schedule D (Form 941) enables IRS to process information on the form more efficiently and accurately. However, you may file Schedule D (Form 941) on paper if necessary. When filing on paper, do not attach Schedule D (Form 941) to your Form 941. Instead, file Schedule D (Form 941) separately using the following address.  IRS Philadelphia Campus Mail Stop 4-G08 151 2970 Market Street Philadelphia, PA 19104   Do not use this address to file Form 941. See Where Should You File? in the Instructions for Form 941 for the filing address of Form 941.     Specific Instructions    Completing Schedule D (Form 941)    Your Business Information Carefully fill in your employer identification number (EIN), name, trade name (doing business as or d/b/a), and complete address at the top of the schedule.    Always be sure the EIN on the Schedule D (Form 941) you file exactly matches the EIN the IRS assigned to your business.     Tax Year of Discrepancies In the box at the top of the schedule, write the tax year (not the quarter) in which the discrepancies occurred. Write the tax year using four digits. For example, if the transaction occurred on March 22, 2011, write \"2011\" in the box. Make sure you fill in the correct tax year so you can reconcile the information appropriately. The tax year must be the same as the calendar year you write in Part 1, line 2.    Be sure to fill in your EIN, business name, other party\\'s EIN, and the tax year of the discrepancies on the top of page 2 as well.     Type of Submission Check the appropriate box to show whether this form is the \"Original\" Schedule D (Form 941) for a specific transaction or corrects (mark \"Corrected\") a Schedule D (Form 941) you previously submitted.      Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) - Notices    Part 1: Answer these background questions     Check the appropriate box to explain the type of transaction for which you are submitting Schedule D (Form 941). See Types of Mergers and Acquisitions on page 1 for details. File Schedule D (Form 941) after either:  A statutory merger or consolidation (Check whether you are an acquired corporation or a surviving corporation.), or An acquisition for which you are using the alternate procedure under Rev. Proc. 2004-53. (Check whether you are a predecessor or a successor.)   Fill in the effective date of the transaction in the box. Make sure you write the month, day, and year in this format: MM/DD/YYYY. The year must be the same as the calendar year you write in the box at the top of the schedule. Fill in the contact information about the OTHER PARTY in the transaction by including the other party\\'s EIN, name, trade name (doing business as or d/b/a), complete address, and phone number. Verify the other party\\'s EIN to make sure it is correct.        Part 2: Tell us about the discrepancies with your returns  Lines 4–8. Gather your information about the social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance earned income credit (EIC) payments (for tax years ending before January 1, 2011) you reported. When entering money amounts from your Forms 941 and W-2 (Copy A) on lines 4–14, you may round to the nearest dollar. Do not show dollar signs but do use commas as appropriate. Show an amount (even if it is zero) for each column of a line. In Column A, fill in the amount you reported to the IRS for the tax year for each of the items. Add the totals from all Forms 941, as corrected by any Forms 941-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, and write your answers on the appropriate lines. In Column B, fill in the amount you reported to SSA for each of the items. Add the totals from all Forms W-2 (Copy A), as corrected by any Forms W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement (Copy A), and write your answers on the appropriate lines. Calculate the differences between the entries in the columns:               Column A        –   Column B            Column C                 Enter any negative result in parentheses, if possible. For example, if line 6, Column A is \"-0-\" and line 6, Column B is \"6,000,\" write \"(6,000)\" on line 6, Column C.    If no Forms W-2 (Copy A) were filed by you, write \"-0-\" in Column B, \"Amount you reported to SSA for the tax year.\"           If you are filing for one transaction only, stop here. If you are filing for more than one transaction, go to Part 3.     Part 3: Fill this part out ONLY if you are filing more than one Schedule D (Form 941) for any calendar year If you are filing only one Schedule D (Form 941) for the calendar year, leave this part blank. When more than one statutory merger, consolidation, or acquisition occurs during a calendar year, file a separate Schedule D (Form 941) for each transaction. Complete Part 3 for each transaction. For instance, if you have 11 different transactions in a calendar year, you need to file 11 different Schedules D (Form 941). Part 2 would be the same for each schedule. Part 3 would show one of the 11 transactions. For example, the amount entered in Part 2 on line 4 for Column C should equal the total of all 11 entries in Part 3 on line 10 for Column C.  Line 9.  Show the number of schedules you are filing for the year and identify which schedule this is. For example, if you had three different transactions in a calendar year and you are filing a Schedule D (Form 941) to describe the second transaction, fill in \"2\" and \"3\" so the sentence reads: \"This is schedule 2 of 3. \"                 Lines 10–14.  For purposes of Part 3, Columns A and B, the term \"employees affected by the transaction reported on this Schedule D\" means those employees who received wages that were reported on Forms 941 filed by one employer but whose wages were reported on Form W-2 (Copy A) filed by another employer as a result of this particular transaction. Report the totals for social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance earned income credit (EIC) payments (for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).    In Column A, fill in the amount you reported to the IRS for the tax year for employees affected by the transaction reported on this Schedule D (Form 941) for each of the items. Add the totals from all your Forms 941, as corrected by any Forms 941-X, and write your answers on the appropriate lines. In Column B, fill in the amount you reported to SSA for the tax year for employees affected by the transaction reported on this Schedule D (Form 941) for each of the items.

For example, if line 12, Column A is \"-0-\" and line 12, Column B is \"6,000,\" write \"(6,000)\" on line 12, Column C.    If no Forms W-2 (Copy A) were filed by you, write \"-0-\" in Column B, \"Amount you reported to SSA for the tax year.\"              Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) - Notices    Part 1: Answer these background questions     Check the appropriate box to explain the type of transaction for which you are submitting Schedule D (Form 941).

The social security wage base limit is $137,700.\\nThe Medicare tax rate is 1.45% each for the employee and employer, unchanged from 2019. There is no wage base limit for Medicare tax.\\nSocial security and Medicare taxes apply to the wages of household workers you pay $2,200 or more in cash wages in 2020. Social security and Medicare taxes apply to election workers who are paid $1,900 or more in cash or an equivalent form of compensation in 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReminders\\n\\nQualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities.\\nFor tax years beginning after 2015, a qualified small business may elect to claim up to $250,000 of its credit for increasing research activities as a payroll tax credit against the employer share of social security tax. The payroll tax credit must be elected on an original income tax return that is timely filed (including extensions). The portion of the credit used against the employer share of social security tax is allowed in the first calendar quarter beginning after the date that the qualified small business filed its income tax return. The election and determination of the credit amount that will be used against the employer share of social security tax are made on Form 6765, Credit for Increasing Research Activities. The amount from Form 6765, line 44, must then be reported on Form 8974, Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities. Form 8974 is used to determine the amount of the credit that can be used in the current quarter. The amount from Form 8974, line 12, is reported on Form 941-SS, line 11. If you’re claiming the research payroll tax credit on your Form 941-SS, you must attach Form 8974 to that Form 941-SS. For more information about the payroll tax credit, see Notice 2017-23, 2017-16 I.R.B. 1100, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-16_IRB#NOT-2017-23 and IRS.gov/ResearchPayrollTC. Also see Adjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities reported on line 11, later.\\n\\n\\nCertification program for professional employer organizations (PEOs).\\nThe Stephen Beck, Jr., ABLE Act of 2014 required the IRS to establish a voluntary certification program for PEOs. PEOs handle various payroll administration and tax reporting responsibilities for their business clients and are typically paid a fee based on payroll costs. To become and remain certified under the certification program, certified professional employer organizations (CPEOs) must meet various requirements described in sections 3511 and 7705 and related published guidance. Certification as a CPEO may affect the employment tax liabilities of both the CPEO and its customers. A CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer of any individual who performs services for a customer of the CPEO and is covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between the CPEO and the customer (CPEO contract), but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System. For more information or to apply to become a CPEO, go to IRS.gov/CPEO.\\nCPEOs generally must file Form 941-SS and Schedule R (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers, electronically. For more information about a CPEO’s requirement to file electronically, see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.\\n\\n\\nOutsourcing payroll duties.\\nGenerally, as an employer, you\\'re responsible to ensure that tax returns are filed and deposits and payments are made, even if you contract with a third party to perform these acts. You remain responsible if the third party fails to perform any required action. Before you choose to outsource any of your payroll and related tax duties (that is, withholding, reporting, and paying over social security, Medicare, FUTA, and income taxes) to a third-party payer, such as a payroll service provider or reporting agent, go to IRS.gov/OutsourcingPayrollDuties. If a CPEO pays wages and other compensation to an individual performing services for you, and the services are covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between you and the CPEO (CPEO contract), then the CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer, but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. However, with respect to certain employees covered by a CPEO contract, you may also be treated as an employer of the employees and, consequently, may also be liable for federal employment taxes imposed on wages and other compensation paid by the CPEO to such employees. For more information on the different types of third-party payer arrangements, see section 16 in Pub. 15.\\n\\n\\nAggregate Form 941-SS filers.\\nAgents and CPEOs must complete Schedule R (Form 941) when filing an aggregate Form 941-SS. Aggregate Forms 941-SS are filed by agents approved by the IRS under section 3504. To request approval to act as an agent for an employer, the agent files Form 2678 with the IRS unless you’re a state or local government agency acting as an agent under the special procedures provided in Rev. Proc. 2013-39, 2013-52 I.R.B. 830, available at IRS.gov/irb/2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39. Aggregate Forms 941-SS are also filed by CPEOs approved by the IRS under section 7705. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System at IRS.gov/CPEO. CPEOs file Form 8973, Certified Professional Employer Organization/Customer Reporting Agreement, to notify the IRS that they started or ended a service contract with a customer. CPEOs generally must file Form 941-SS and Schedule R (Form 941) electronically. For more information about a CPEO’s requirement to file electronically, see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf both an employer and a section 3504 authorized agent paid wages to an employee during a quarter, or if both an employer and a CPEO paid wages to an employee during a quarter, both the employer and the section 3504 authorized agent (or the CPEO, if applicable) should file Form 941 or Form 941-SS, as appropriate, reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the applicable quarter and issue Forms W-2, W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, or W-2VI, as appropriate, reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the year.\\n\\nWork opportunity tax credit for qualified tax-exempt organizations hiring qualified veterans.\\nQualified tax-exempt organizations that hire eligible unemployed veterans may be able to claim the work opportunity tax credit against their payroll tax liability using Form 5884-C. For more information, go to IRS.gov/WOTC.\\n\\n\\nCOBRA premium assistance credit.\\nEffective for tax periods beginning after 2013, the credit for COBRA premium assistance payments can\\'t be claimed on Form 941-SS. Instead, after filing your Form 941-SS, file Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit. Filing a Form 941-X before filing a Form 941-SS for the quarter may result in errors or delays in processing your Form 941-X. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 941-X.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re entitled to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit, but aren\\'t otherwise required to file Form 941-SS, file a Form 941-SS with -0- entered on line 14 before filing a Form 941-X to claim the credit. \\n\\n\\nCorrecting a previously filed Form 941-SS.\\nIf you discover an error on a previously filed Form 941-SS, make the correction using Form 941-X. Form 941-X is filed separately from Form 941-SS. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 941-X, section 9 of Pub. 80, or go to IRS.gov/CorrectingEmploymentTaxes.\\n\\n\\nFederal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT).\\nYou must use EFT to make all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). If you don\\'t want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your behalf. Also, you may arrange for your financial institution to initiate a same-day wire payment on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of the Treasury. Services provided by your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other third party may have a fee.\\nFor more information on making federal tax deposits, see section 8 of Pub. 80. To get more information about EFTPS or to enroll in EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov or call one of the following numbers.\\n\\n\\n\\n800-555-4477 (toll free; for use by U.S. Virgin Islands only).\\n\\n\\n800-733-4829 (TDD).\\n\\n\\n800-244-4829 (Spanish).\\n\\n\\n303-967-5916 (toll call).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAdditional information about EFTPS is available in Pub. 966.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor an EFTPS deposit to be on time, you must submit the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date the deposit is due. See section 8 of Pub. 80 for details.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSame-day wire payment option.\\nIf you fail to submit a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Collection Service (FTCS) to make a same-day wire payment. To use the same-day wire payment method, you will need to make arrangements with your financial institution ahead of time. Please check with your financial institution regarding availability, deadlines, and costs. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for payments made this way. To learn more about the information you will need to give your financial institution to make a same-day wire payment, go to IRS.gov/SameDayWire.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTimeliness of federal tax deposits.\\nIf a deposit is required to be made on a day that isn\\'t a business day, the deposit is considered timely if it is made by the close of the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The term \"legal holiday\" for deposit purposes includes only those legal holidays in the District of Columbia. Legal holidays in the District of Columbia are provided in section 8 of Pub. 80.\\n\\n\\n\\nElectronic filing and payment.\\nBusinesses can enjoy the benefits of filing and paying their federal taxes electronically. Whether you rely on a tax professional or handle your own taxes, the IRS offers you convenient programs to make filing and paying easier. Spend less time worrying about taxes and more time running your business. Use e-file and EFTPS to your benefit.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor e-file, go to IRS.gov/EmploymentEfile for additional information. A fee may be charged to file electronically.\\n\\n\\nFor EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov or call one of the numbers provided under Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor electronic filing of Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, and W-2VI, go to SSA.gov/employer. You may be required to file Forms W-2 electronically. For details, see the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re filing your tax return or paying your federal taxes electronically, a valid employer identification number (EIN) is required at the time the return is filed or the payment is made. If a valid EIN isn\\'t provided, the return or payment won\\'t be processed. This may result in penalties. See Employer identification number (EIN), later, for information about applying for an EIN.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nElectronic funds withdrawal (EFW).\\nIf you file Form 941-SS electronically, you can e-file and use EFW to pay the balance due in a single step using tax preparation software or through a tax professional. However, don\\'t use EFW to make federal tax deposits. For more information on paying your taxes using EFW, go to IRS.gov/EFW.\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit or debit card payments.\\nYou can pay the balance due shown on Form 941-SS by credit or debit card.

It explains the forms you must give your employees, those your employees must give you, and those you must send to the IRS. See Pub. 15-A, Employer\\'s Supplemental Tax Guide, for specialized employment tax information supplementing the basic information provided in Pub. 80.\\nFederal law requires you, as an employer, to withhold certain taxes from your employees\\' pay. Each time you pay wages, you must withhold—or take out of your employees\\' pay—certain amounts for social security tax and Medicare tax. You must also withhold Additional Medicare Tax from wages you pay to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. Under the withholding system, taxes withheld from your employees are credited to your employees in payment of their tax liabilities.\\nFederal law also requires you to pay any liability for the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes. This share of social security and Medicare taxes isn\\'t withheld from employees.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must File Form 941-SS?\\nGenerally, you must file a return for the first quarter in which you pay wages subject to social security and Medicare taxes, and for each quarter thereafter until you file a final return. Use Form 941-SS if your principal place of business is in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, or if you have employees who are subject to income tax withholding for these jurisdictions.\\nUse Form 941-SS to report the following amounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWages/tips subject to social security and Medicare taxes.\\n\\n\\nBoth the employer and the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Medicare Tax withheld from employees.\\n\\n\\nCurrent quarter\\'s adjustments to social security and Medicare taxes for fractions of cents, sick pay, tips, and group-term life insurance.\\n\\n\\nQualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon\\'t use Form 941-SS if you have both employees who are subject to U.S. income tax withholding and employees who aren\\'t subject to U.S. income tax withholding. Instead, you must file only Form 941 (or Form 944) and include all of your employees\\' wages on that form.\\nDon\\'t use Form 941-SS to report backup withholding or income tax withholding on nonpayroll payments such as pensions, annuities, and gambling winnings. Report these types of withholding on Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax. Also, don\\'t use Form 941-SS to report unemployment taxes. Report unemployment taxes (U.S. Virgin Islands employers only) on Form 940, Employer\\'s Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return.\\nAfter you file your first Form 941-SS, you must file a return each quarter, even if you have no tax liability to report, unless you filed a final return or one of the exceptions listed next applies.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExceptions\\nSpecial rules apply to some employers.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you received notification to file Form 944, you must file Form 944 annually; don\\'t file Form 941-SS quarterly.\\n\\n\\nSeasonal employers don\\'t have to file a Form 941-SS for quarters in which they have no tax liability because they have paid no wages. To tell the IRS that you won\\'t file a return for one or more quarters during the year, check the box on line 18 every quarter you file Form 941-SS. The IRS generally won\\'t inquire about unfiled returns if at least one taxable return is filed each year. However, you must check the box on line 18 on every quarterly return you file. Otherwise, the IRS will expect a return to be filed for each quarter.\\n\\n\\nEmployers of household employees don\\'t usually file Form 941-SS. See Pub. 80, Pub. 926, and Schedule H (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for more information.\\n\\n\\nEmployers of farm employees don\\'t file Form 941-SS for wages paid for agricultural labor. See Form 943 and Pub. 51 for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf none of the above exceptions applies and you haven\\'t filed a final return, you must file Form 941-SS each quarter even if you didn\\'t pay wages during the quarter. Use IRS e-file, if possible.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRequesting To File Forms 941-SS Instead of Form 944, or Requesting To File Form 944 Instead of Forms 941-SS\\n\\nRequesting to file Forms 941-SS instead of Form 944.\\nEmployers in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that would otherwise be required to file Form 944, Employer\\'s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return, may contact the IRS to request to file quarterly Forms 941-SS instead of annual Form 944. To request to file quarterly Forms 941-SS to report your social security and Medicare taxes for the 2020 calendar year, you must either call the IRS at 800-829-4933 (U.S. Virgin Islands only) or 267-941-1000 (toll call) between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020, or send a written request postmarked between January 1, 2020, and March 16, 2020. After you contact the IRS, the IRS will send you a written notice that your filing requirement has been changed to Forms 941-SS. You must receive written notice from the IRS to file Forms 941-SS instead of Form 944 before you may file these forms. If you don\\'t receive this notice, you must file Form 944 for calendar year 2020.\\n\\n\\nRequesting to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941-SS.\\nIf you’re required to file Forms 941-SS but believe your employment taxes for 2020 will be $1,000 or less, you may request to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941-SS by calling the IRS at 800-829-4933 (U.S. Virgin Islands only) or 267-941-1000 (toll call) between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020, or sending a written request postmarked between January 1, 2020, and March 16, 2020. After you contact the IRS, the IRS will send you a written notice that your filing requirement has been changed to Form 944. You must receive written notice from the IRS to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941-SS before you may file this form. If you don\\'t receive this notice, you must file Forms 941-SS for calendar year 2020.\\n\\n\\nWhere to send written requests.\\nWritten requests should be sent to: \\nDepartment of the Treasury\\nInternal Revenue Service\\nOgden, UT 84201-0038\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information about these procedures, see Rev. Proc. 2009-51, 2009-45 I.R.B. 625, available at IRS.gov/irb/2009-45_IRB#RP-2009-51.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat if You Reorganize or Close Your Business?\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIf You Sell or Transfer Your Business . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you sell or transfer your business during the quarter, you and the new owner must each file a Form 941-SS for the quarter in which the transfer occurred. Report only the wages you paid.\\nWhen two businesses merge, the continuing firm must file a return for the quarter in which the change took place and the other firm should file a final return.\\nChanging from one form of business to another—such as from a sole proprietorship to a partnership or corporation—is considered a transfer. If a transfer occurs, you may need a new EIN. See Pub. 1635 and section 1 of Pub. 80 for more information.\\nAttach a statement to your return with:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe new owner\\'s name (or the new name of the business);\\n\\n\\nWhether the business is now a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation;\\n\\n\\nThe kind of change that occurred (a sale or transfer);\\n\\n\\nThe date of the change; and\\n\\n\\nThe name of the person keeping the payroll records and the address where those records will be kept.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Your Business Has Closed . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you go out of business or stop paying wages to your employees, you must file a final return. To tell the IRS that Form 941-SS for a particular quarter is your final return, check the box on line 17 and enter the final date you paid wages. Also attach a statement to your return showing the name of the person keeping the payroll records and the address where those records will be kept.\\nSee Terminating a business in the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for information about earlier dates for the expedited furnishing and filing of the following Wage and Tax Statements when a final Form 941-SS is filed.\\n\\n\\n\\nW-2AS, American Samoa.\\n\\n\\nW-2CM, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\\n\\n\\nW-2GU, Guam.\\n\\n\\nW-2VI, U.S. Virgin Islands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you participated in a statutory merger or consolidation, or qualify for predecessor-successor status due to an acquisition, you should generally file Schedule D (Form 941), Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations. See the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) to determine whether you should file Schedule D (Form 941) and when you should file it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen Must You File?\\nFile your initial Form 941-SS for the quarter in which you first paid wages that are subject to social security and Medicare taxes. See the table below titled When To File Form 941-SS.\\nThen you must file for every quarter after that—every 3 months—even if you have no taxes to report, unless you’re a seasonal employer or are filing your final return. See Seasonal employers and If Your Business Has Closed, earlier.\\nFile Form 941-SS only once for each quarter. If you filed electronically, don\\'t file a paper Form 941-SS. For more information about filing Form 941-SS electronically, see Electronic filing and payment, earlier.\\n\\nWhen To File Form 941-SS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Form 941-SS is due by the last day of the month that follows the end of the quarter.\\n\\n\\nThe Quarter Includes . . .\\nQuarter Ends\\nForm 941-SS\\n\\t\\t\\tIs Due\\n\\n\\n1. January, February, March\\nMarch 31\\nApril 30\\n\\n\\n2. April, May, June\\nJune 30\\nJuly 31\\n\\n\\n3. July, August, September\\nSeptember 30\\nOctober 31\\n\\n\\n4. October, November, December\\nDecember 31\\nJanuary 31\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor example, you generally must report wages you pay during the first quarter—which is January through March—by April 30. If you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the quarter, you may file by the 10th day of the second month that follows the end of the quarter. For example, you may file Form 941-SS by May 10 if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the first quarter.\\nIf we receive Form 941-SS after the due date, we will treat Form 941-SS as filed on time if the envelope containing Form 941-SS is properly addressed, contains sufficient postage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the due date, or sent by an IRS-designated private delivery service (PDS) on or before the due date. If you don\\'t follow these guidelines, we generally will consider Form 941-SS filed when it is actually received. For more information about PDSs, see Where Should You File, later.\\nIf any due date for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file your return on the next business day.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow Should You Complete Form 941-SS?\\nType or print your EIN, name, and address in the spaces provided. Also enter your name and EIN on the top of page 2. Don\\'t use your social security number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Generally, enter the business (legal) name you used when you applied for your EIN. For example, if you’re a sole proprietor, enter \"Haleigh Smith\" on the \"Name\" line and \"Haleigh\\'s Cycles\" on the \"Trade name\" line. Leave the \"Trade name\" line blank if it is the same as your \"Name.\"\\nIf you use a tax preparer to fill out Form 941-SS, make sure the preparer shows your business name exactly as it appeared when you applied for your EIN.\\n\\nEmployer identification number (EIN).\\nTo make sure that businesses comply with federal tax laws, the IRS monitors tax filings and payments by using a numerical system to identify taxpayers. A unique nine-digit EIN is assigned to all corporations, partnerships, and some sole proprietors. Businesses needing an EIN must apply for a number and use it throughout the life of the business on all tax returns, payments, and reports.\\nYour business should have only one EIN. If you have more than one and aren\\'t sure which one to use, write to the IRS office where you file your returns (using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, later) or call the IRS at 800-829-4933 (toll free; for use by U.S. Virgin Islands only) or 267-941-1099 (toll call).\\nIf you don\\'t have an EIN, you may apply for one online by visiting IRS.gov/EIN. You may also apply for an EIN by faxing or mailing Form SS-4 to the IRS. If the principal business was created outside of the United States or U.S. territories, you may also apply for an EIN by calling 267-941-1099 (toll call). If you haven\\'t received your EIN by the due date of Form 941-SS, write \"Applied For\" and the date you applied in this entry space.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re filing your tax return electronically, a valid EIN is required at the time the return is filed. If a valid EIN isn\\'t provided, the return won\\'t be accepted. This may result in penalties.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAlways be sure the EIN on the form you file exactly matches the EIN the IRS assigned to your business. Don\\'t use your SSN or ITIN on forms that ask for an EIN. Filing a Form 941-SS with an incorrect EIN or using another business\\'s EIN may result in penalties and delays in processing your return.\\n\\n\\nIf you change your business name, business address, or responsible party . . .\\nNotify the IRS immediately if you change your business name, business address, or responsible party. \\n\\n\\n\\nWrite to the IRS office where you file your returns (using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, later) to notify the IRS of any business name change. See Pub. 1635 to see if you need to apply for a new EIN.\\n\\n\\nComplete and mail Form 8822-B to notify the IRS of a business address or responsible party change. Don\\'t mail Form 8822-B with your Form 941-SS. For a definition of \"responsible party,\" see the Instructions for Form SS-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCheck the Box for the Quarter\\nUnder \"Report for this Quarter of 2020\" at the top of Form 941-SS, check the appropriate box of the quarter for which you\\'re filing. Make sure the quarter checked is the same as shown on any attached Schedule B (Form 941), Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule Depositors.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCompleting and Filing Form 941-SS\\nMake entries on Form 941-SS as follows to enable accurate processing.\\n\\n\\n\\nUse 10-point Courier font (if possible) for all entries if you’re typing or using a computer to complete your form. Portable Document Format (PDF) forms on IRS.gov have fillable fields with acceptable font specifications.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t enter dollar signs and decimal points. Commas are optional. Enter dollars to the left of the preprinted decimal point and cents to the right of it. Don’t round entries to whole dollars. Always show an amount for cents, even if it is zero.\\n\\n\\nLeave blank any data field (except lines 1 and 12) with a value of zero.\\n\\n\\nEnter negative amounts using a minus sign (if possible). Otherwise, use parentheses.\\n\\n\\nEnter your name and EIN on all pages and attachments.\\n\\n\\nStaple multiple sheets in the upper left corner when filing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReconciling Forms 941-SS and W-3SS\\nThe IRS matches amounts reported on your four quarterly Forms 941-SS with Form W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, or W-2VI amounts totaled on your yearly Form W-3SS, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements. If the amounts don\\'t agree, you may be contacted by the IRS or the Social Security Administration (SSA). The following amounts are reconciled.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial security wages.\\n\\n\\nSocial security tips.\\n\\n\\nMedicare wages and tips.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUse Schedule D (Form 941) to explain certain wage, tax, and payment discrepancies between Forms 941-SS and Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, W-2VI, W-3SS, and W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, that were caused by acquisitions, statutory mergers, or consolidations. For more information, see the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941). Also see Rev. Proc. 2004-53 for more information. You can find Rev.

Go to IRS.gov/PDS for the current list of PDSs. For the IRS mailing address to use if you\\'re using a PDS, go to IRS.gov/PDSstreetAddresses. Select the address on the webpage that is given for the Ogden Submission Processing Center.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYour filing address may have changed from that used to file your employment tax return in prior years. Don\\'t send Form 941-SS or any payments to the SSA.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDepositing Your Taxes\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou must deposit all depository taxes electronically by EFT. For more information, see Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) under Reminders, earlier.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMust You Deposit Your Taxes?\\nYou may have to deposit both the employer and employee social security taxes and Medicare taxes.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) are less than $2,500 for the current quarter or the prior quarter, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. You don\\'t have to make a deposit. To avoid a penalty, you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely. For more information on paying with a timely filed return, see the instructions for line 14, later. If you’re not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $2,500 (and your liability for the prior quarter wasn\\'t less than $2,500), make deposits using the semiweekly or monthly rules so you won\\'t be subject to failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalties.\\n\\n\\nIf your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) are $2,500 or more for the current quarter and the prior quarter. You must make deposits according to your deposit schedule. See section 8 of Pub. 80 for information about payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule and for rules about federal tax deposits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou may reduce your deposits during the quarter by the amount of the COBRA premium assistance credit that will be reflected on your Form 941-X, but only if you use the claim process and not the adjustment process to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit on your Form 941-X for the quarter.\\nThe COBRA premium assistance credit is treated as a credit on the first day of the return period (that is, January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). However, because the credit is now claimed on Form 941-X filed after submission of the Form 941-SS, an employer that reduces its required deposits in anticipation of the credit will receive a system-generated notice reflecting a balance due and associated penalties and interest, if applicable. The balance due, including any related penalties and interest, resulting from the reduction in deposits in anticipation of the credit will be abated when the credit is applied. Such abatement will generally occur without any further action from the employer.\\nAlternatively, to prevent triggering a system-generated balance due notice, the employer can make its deposits without a reduction in anticipation of the COBRA premium assistance credit and follow the ordinary procedures for filing a claim for refund or adjusted return using Form 941-X.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen Must You Deposit Your Taxes?\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine if You’re a Monthly or Semiweekly Schedule Depositor for the Quarter\\n\\n\\n\\nThe IRS uses two different sets of deposit rules to determine when businesses must deposit their social security and Medicare taxes. These schedules tell you when a deposit is due after you have a payday.\\nYour deposit schedule isn\\'t determined by how often you pay your employees. Your deposit schedule depends on the total tax liability you reported on Form 941-SS during the previous 4-quarter lookback period (July 1 of the second preceding calendar year through June 30 of the preceding calendar year). See section 8 of Pub. 80 for details. If you filed Form 944 in either 2018 or 2019, your lookback period is the 2018 calendar year.\\nBefore the beginning of each calendar year, determine which type of deposit schedule you must use.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor.\\n\\n\\nIf you reported more than $50,000 of taxes during the lookback period, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re a monthly schedule depositor and accumulate a $100,000 tax liability on any day during the deposit period, you become a semiweekly schedule depositor on the next day and remain so for at least the rest of the calendar year and for the following calendar year. See $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule in section 8 of Pub. 80 for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat About Penalties and Interest?\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAvoiding Penalties and Interest\\nYou can avoid paying penalties and interest if you do all of the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nDeposit or pay your taxes when they are due.\\n\\n\\nFile your fully completed Form 941-SS on time.\\n\\n\\nReport your tax liability accurately.\\n\\n\\nSubmit valid checks for tax payments.\\n\\n\\nFurnish accurate Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, or W-2VI to employees.\\n\\n\\nFile Form W-3SS and Copy A of Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, or W-2VI with the SSA on time and accurately.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPenalties and interest are charged on taxes paid late and returns filed late at a rate set by law. See section 8 of Pub. 80 for details.\\nUse Form 843 to request abatement of assessed penalties or interest. Don\\'t request abatement of assessed penalties or interest on Form 941-SS or Form 941-X.\\nIf you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don\\'t attach an explanation when you file your return.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf federal income, social security, and Medicare taxes that must be withheld (that is, trust fund taxes) aren\\'t withheld or aren\\'t deposited or paid to the United States Treasury, the trust fund recovery penalty may apply. The penalty is 100% of the unpaid trust fund tax. If these unpaid taxes can\\'t be immediately collected from the employer or business, the trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to be responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. For more information, see section 8 of Pub. 80.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAdjustment of Tax on Tips\\nIf, by the 10th of the month after the month you received an employee\\'s report on tips, you don\\'t have enough employee funds available to withhold the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes, you no longer have to collect it. Report the entire amount of these tips on line 5b (Taxable social security tips), line 5c (Taxable Medicare wages and tips), and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 5d (Taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding). Include as a negative adjustment on line 9 the total uncollected employee share of the social security and Medicare taxes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhere Can You Obtain Forms?\\nSee Pub. 80 for information on ordering IRS forms.

You’re required to begin withholding Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which you pay wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. Additional Medicare Tax is only imposed on the employee. There is no employer share of Additional Medicare Tax.

Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand—Tax Due on Unreported Tips\\nEnter the tax due from your Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand on line 5f. The IRS issues a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand to advise an employer of the amount of tips received by employees who failed to report or underreported tips to the employer. An employer isn\\'t liable for the employer share of the social security and Medicare taxes on unreported tips until notice and demand for the taxes is made to the employer by the IRS in a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand. The tax due may have been determined from tips reported to the IRS on employees\\' Forms 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income, or other tips that weren\\'t reported to their employer as determined by the IRS during an examination. For additional information, see Rev.

For example, enter \"-10.59\" instead of \"(10.59).\" However, if your software only allows for parentheses in entering negative amounts, you may use them.\\n\\nCurrent quarter\\'s adjustments.\\nIn certain cases, you must adjust the amounts you entered as social security and Medicare taxes in column 2 of lines 5a–5d to figure your correct tax liability for this quarter\\'s Form 941-SS. See section 9 of Pub. 80.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n7. Current quarter\\'s adjustment for fractions of cents.\\nEnter adjustments for fractions of cents (due to rounding) relating to the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes withheld. The employee share of amounts shown in column 2 of lines 5a–5d may differ slightly from amounts actually withheld from employees\\' pay due to the rounding of social security and Medicare taxes based on statutory rates. This adjustment may be a positive or negative amount.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n8. Current quarter\\'s adjustment for sick pay.\\nEnter a negative adjustment for the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes that were withheld and deposited by your third-party sick pay payer with regard to sick pay paid by the third party. These wages should be included on line 5a, line 5c, and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 5d.

Otherwise, see Overpayment, later.\\nNever make an entry on both lines 14 and 15.\\nYou don\\'t have to pay if line 14 is under $1. Generally, you should have a balance due only if your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) for the current quarter or prior quarter are less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. However, see section 8 of Pub. 80 for information about payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule.\\nIf you were required to make federal tax deposits, pay the amount shown on line 14 by EFT.

Overpayment\\nIf line 13 is more than line 12, enter the difference on line 15. Never make an entry on both lines 14 and 15.\\nIf you deposited more than the correct amount for the quarter, you can choose to have the IRS either refund the overpayment or apply it to your next return. Check only one box on line 15. If you don\\'t check either box or if you check both boxes, generally we will apply the overpayment to your next return. Regardless of any boxes you check or don’t check on line 15, we may apply your overpayment to any past due tax account that is shown in our records under your EIN.\\nIf line 15 is under $1, we will send a refund or apply it to your next return only if you ask us in writing to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nComplete Both Pages\\nYou must complete both pages of Form 941-SS and sign on page 2.

Tax Liability for the Quarter\\nCheck one of the boxes on line 16. Follow the instructions for each box to determine if you need to enter your monthly tax liability on Form 941-SS or your daily tax liability on Schedule B (Form 941).\\n\\nDe minimis exception.\\nIf line 12 is less than $2,500 or line 12 on the prior quarterly return was less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter, check the first box on line 16 and go to Part 3.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you meet the de minimis exception based on the prior quarter and line 12 for the current quarter is $100,000 or more, you must provide a record of your federal tax liability. If you’re a monthly schedule depositor, complete the deposit schedule on line 16. If you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, attach Schedule B (Form 941).\\n\\n\\nMonthly schedule depositor.\\nIf you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule discussed in section 8 of Pub. 80 applies. Check the second box on line 16 and enter your tax liability for each month in the quarter. Add the amounts for each month. Enter the result in the \"Total liability for quarter\" box.\\nNote that your total tax liability for the quarter must equal your total taxes shown on line 12. If it doesn\\'t, your tax deposits and payments may not be counted as timely. Don\\'t change your tax liability on line 16 by adjustments reported on any Forms 941-X.\\nYou’re a monthly schedule depositor for the calendar year if the amount of your Form 941-SS taxes reported for the lookback period is $50,000 or less. The lookback period is the 4 consecutive quarters ending on June 30 of the prior year. For 2020, the lookback period begins July 1, 2018, and ends June 30, 2019. For details on the deposit rules, see section 8 of Pub. 80. If you filed Form 944 in 2018 or 2019, your lookback period is the 2018 calendar year.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe amounts entered on line 16 are a summary of your monthly tax liability, not a summary of deposits you made. If you don\\'t properly enter your liabilities when required or if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor and report your liabilities on line 16 instead of on Schedule B (Form 941), you may be assessed an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. See Deposit Penalties in section 8 of Pub. 80 for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReporting adjustments from lines 7–9 on line 16.\\nIf your net adjustment during a month is negative and it exceeds your total tax liability for the month, don\\'t enter a negative amount for the month. Instead, enter \"-0-\" for the month and carry over the unused portion of the adjustment to the next month.\\n\\n\\nSemiweekly schedule depositor.\\nIf you reported more than $50,000 of taxes for the lookback period, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor. Check the third box on line 16.\\nYou must complete Schedule B (Form 941) and submit it with your Form 941-SS. Don\\'t file Schedule B (Form 941) with your Form 941-SS if you’re a monthly schedule depositor.\\nDon\\'t change your tax liability on Schedule B (Form 941) by adjustments reported on any Forms 941-X.\\n\\n\\nAdjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities reported on line 11.\\nMonthly schedule depositors and semiweekly schedule depositors must account for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities (line 11) when reporting their tax liabilities on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941). The total tax liability for the quarter must equal the amount reported on line 12. Failure to account for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941) may cause line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941) to be more than the total tax liability reported on line 12.\\nThe qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities applies to the employer share of social security tax on wages paid in the quarter that begins after the income tax return electing the credit has been filed. In completing line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941), you take into account the payroll tax credit against the liability for the employer share of social security tax starting with the first payroll payment of the quarter that includes payments of wages subject to social security tax to your employees. The credit may be taken to the extent of the employer share of social security tax on wages associated with the first payroll payment, and then to the extent of the employer share of social security tax associated with succeeding payroll payments in the quarter until the credit is used. Don\\'t reduce your monthly tax liability reported on line 16 or your daily tax liability reported on Schedule B (Form 941) below zero. Consistent with the entries on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941), the payroll tax credit should be taken into account in making deposits of employment tax. If any payroll tax credit is remaining at the end of the quarter that has not been used completely because it exceeds the employer share of social security tax for the quarter, the excess credit may be carried forward to the succeeding quarter and allowed as a payroll tax credit for the succeeding quarter. The payroll tax credit may not be taken as a credit against income tax withholding, Medicare tax, or the employee share of social security tax. Also, the remaining payroll tax credit may not be carried back and taken as a credit against wages paid from preceding quarters. \\n\\n\\nExample.\\nRose Co. is an employer with a calendar tax year that filed its timely income tax return on April 15, 2020. Rose Co. elected to take the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities on Form 6765. The third quarter of 2020 is the first quarter that begins after Rose Co. filed the income tax return making the payroll tax credit election. Therefore, the payroll tax credit applies against Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid to employees in the third quarter of 2020. Rose Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor. Rose Co. completes Schedule B (Form 941) by reducing the amount of liability entered for the first payroll payment in the third quarter of 2020 that includes wages subject to social security tax by the lesser of (1) its share of social security tax on the wages, or (2) the available payroll tax credit. If the payroll tax credit elected is more than Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on the first payroll payment of the quarter, the excess payroll tax credit would be carried forward to succeeding payroll payments in the third quarter until it is used. If the amount of the payroll tax credit exceeds Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid to its employees in the third quarter, the excess credit would be treated as a payroll tax credit against its share of social security tax on wages paid in the fourth quarter. If the amount of the payroll tax credit remaining exceeded Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid in the fourth quarter, it could be carried forward and treated as a payroll tax credit for the first quarter of 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart 3: Tell Us About Your Business\\nIn Part 3, answer only those questions that apply to your business. If the questions don\\'t apply, leave them blank and go to Part 4.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n17. If Your Business Has Closed . . .\\nIf you go out of business or stop paying wages, you must file a final return.

For additional filing requirements, see If Your Business Has Closed, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n18. If You’re a Seasonal Employer . . .\\nIf you hire employees seasonally—such as for summer or winter only—check the box on line 18. Checking the box tells the IRS not to expect four Forms 941-SS from you throughout the year because you haven\\'t paid wages regularly.\\nGenerally, we won\\'t ask about unfiled returns if at least one taxable return is filed each year. However, you must check the box on line 18 on every Form 941-SS you file. Otherwise, the IRS will expect a return to be filed for each quarter.\\nAlso, when you complete Form 941-SS, be sure to check the box on the top of the form that corresponds to the quarter reported.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart 4: May We Speak With Your Third-Party Designee?\\nIf you want to allow an employee, a paid tax preparer, or another person to discuss your Form 941-SS with the IRS, check the \"Yes\" box in Part 4. Enter the name, phone number, and the five-digit personal identification number (PIN) of the specific person to speak with—not the name of the firm that prepared your tax return. The designee may choose any five numbers as his or her PIN.\\nBy checking \"Yes,\" you authorize the IRS to talk to the person you named (your designee) about any questions we may have while we process your return.

The IRS won\\'t send notices to your designee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou’re not authorizing your designee to bind you to anything (including additional tax liability) or to otherwise represent you before the IRS. If you want to expand your designee\\'s authorization, see Pub. 947.\\nThe authorization will automatically expire 1 year from the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing your Form 941-SS. If you or your designee wants to terminate the authorization, write to the IRS office for your location using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart 5: Sign Here (Approved Roles)\\nComplete all information and sign Form 941-SS.

Paid preparers must sign paper returns with a manual signature. The preparer must give you a copy of the return in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS.\\nIf you’re a paid preparer, enter your preparer tax identification number (PTIN) in the space provided. Include your complete address. If you work for a firm, enter the firm\\'s name and the EIN of the firm. You can apply for a PTIN online or by filing Form W-12. For more information about applying for a PTIN online, go to IRS.gov/PTIN. You can\\'t use your PTIN in place of the EIN of the tax preparation firm.\\nGenerally, don\\'t complete this section if you’re filing the return as a reporting agent and have a valid Form 8655 on file with the IRS. However, a reporting agent must complete this section if the reporting agent offered legal advice, for example, advising the client on determining whether its workers are employees or independent contractors for federal tax purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow To Get Forms, Instructions, and Publications From the IRS\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou can view, download, or print most of the forms, instructions, and publications you may need at IRS.gov/Forms.

References to Form 941 on Form 941-X and in these instructions also apply to Form 941-SS, Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return—American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, unless otherwise noted. We use the terms \"correct\" and \"corrections\" on Form 941-X and in these instructions to include interest-free adjustments under sections 6205 and 6413 and claims for refund and abatement under sections 6402, 6414, and 6404. See Rev. Rul. 2009-39 for examples of how the interest-free adjustment and claim for refund rules apply in 10 different situations. You can find Rev. Rul. 2009-39, 2009-52, I.R.B. 951 at IRS.gov/irb/2009-52_IRB/ar14.html. When you discover an error on a previously filed Form 941, you must:  Correct that error using Form 941-X, File a separate Form 941-X for each Form 941 that you’re correcting, and File Form 941-X separately. Don’t file Form 941-X with Form 941.    If you didn’t file a Form 941 for one or more quarters, don’t use Form 941-X. Instead, file Form 941 for each of those quarters. See also When Should You File Form 941-X? below. However, if you didn’t file Forms 941 because you improperly treated workers as independent contractors or nonemployees and are now reclassifying them as employees, see the instructions for line 23, later. Report the correction of underreported and overreported amounts for the same tax period on a single Form 941-X, unless you’re requesting a refund or abatement. If you’re requesting a refund or abatement and are correcting both underreported and overreported amounts, file one Form 941-X correcting the underreported amounts only and a second Form 941-X correcting the overreported amounts. You’ll use the adjustment process if you underreported employment taxes and are making a payment, or if you overreported employment taxes and will be applying the credit to Form 941 for the period during which you file Form 941-X. However, see the Caution under Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X, later, if you’re correcting overreported amounts during the last 90 days of a period of limitations. You’ll use the claim process if you overreported employment taxes and are requesting a refund or abatement of the overreported amount. Follow the chart on the back of Form 941-X for help in choosing whether to use the adjustment process or the claim process. Be sure to give us a detailed explanation on line 24 for each correction that you show on Form 941-X. Continue to report current quarter fractions of cents, third-party sick pay, tips, and group-term life insurance on Form 941, lines 7–9. You have additional requirements to complete when filing Form 941-X, such as certifying that you filed (or will file) all applicable Forms W-2 and Forms W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statements, with the Social Security Administration (SSA). For corrections of overreported federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax, you must make any certifications that apply to your situation.    Don’t use Form 941-X to correct Form CT-1, 943, 944, or 945. Instead, use the \"X\" form that corresponds to those forms (Form CT-1 X, 943-X, 944-X, or 945-X).     Where Can You Get Help? For help filing Form 941-X or for questions about federal employment taxes and tax corrections, you can:  Visit IRS.gov and enter \"employment taxes\" in the search box; See Pub. 15 for correcting Form 941, or Pub. 80, Federal Tax Guide for Employers in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, for correcting Form 941-SS; or Call the IRS Business and Specialty Tax Line at 1-800-829-4933 or 1-800-829-4059 (TDD/TTY for persons who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability) Monday–Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. local time (Alaska and Hawaii follow Pacific time).    See also How Can You Order Forms, Instructions, and Publications from the IRS, later.     When Should You File Form 941-X? File Form 941-X when you discover an error on a previously filed Form 941. However, if your only errors on Form 941 relate to the number of employees who received wages or to federal tax liabilities reported on Form 941, Part 2, or on Schedule B (Form 941), Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule Depositors, don’t file Form 941-X. For more information about correcting federal tax liabilities reported on Form 941, Part 2, or on Schedule B (Form 941), see the Instructions for Schedule B (Form 941).  Due dates.  The due date for filing Form 941-X depends on when you discover an error and if you underreported or overreported tax. If you underreported tax, see Underreported tax, later. For overreported amounts, you may choose to either make an interest-free adjustment or file a claim for refund or abatement. If you’re correcting overreported amounts, see Overreported tax—adjustment process or Overreported tax—claim process, later. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file Form 941-X on the next business day. If we receive Form 941-X after the due date, we will treat Form 941-X as filed on time if the envelope containing Form 941-X is properly addressed, contains sufficient postage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the due date, or sent by an IRS-designated private delivery service on or before the due date. If you don’t follow these guidelines, we will consider Form 941-X filed when it is actually received. See Pub. 15 or Pub. 80 for more information on legal holidays and IRS-designated private delivery services.    Underreported tax.  If you’re correcting underreported tax, you must file Form 941-X by the due date of the return for the return period in which you discovered the error and pay the amount you owe by the time you file. Doing so will generally ensure that your correction is interest free and not subject to failure-to-pay or failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalties. See What About Penalties and Interest, later. For details on how to make a payment, see the instructions for line 21, later. If Form 941-X is filed late (after the due date of the return for the return period in which you discovered the error), you must attach an amended Schedule B (Form 941) to Form 941-X. Otherwise, the IRS may assess an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. The total tax reported on the \"Total liability for the quarter\" line of Schedule B (Form 941) must match the corrected tax (Form 941, line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017), combined with any correction entered on Form 941-X, line 19) for the quarter, less any previous abatements and interest-free tax assessments.          If you discover an error in   Form 941-X is due                  1. January, February, March       April 30     2. April, May, June       July 31     3. July, August, September       October 31     4. October, November, December       January 31                 The dates shown in the table above apply only to corrections of underreported amounts. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file Form 941-X on the next business day.      Example—You owe tax. On April 10, 2017, you discovered that you underreported $10,000 of social security and Medicare wages on your 2016 first quarter Form 941. File Form 941-X and pay the amount you owe by July 31, 2017, because you discovered the error in the second quarter of 2017, and July 31, 2017, is the due date for that quarter. If you file Form 941-X before July 31, 2017, pay the amount you owe by the time you file.       Overreported tax—adjustment process.  If you overreported tax on Form 941 and choose to apply the credit to Form 941 or Form 944, file an adjusted return on Form 941-X soon after you discover the error but more than 90 days before the period of limitations on the credit or refund for Form 941 expires. See Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X? below.      If you reduced your deposits during the quarter by the amount of the COBRA premium assistance credit that will be reflected on your Form 941-X, don’t use the adjustment process to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit. Use the claim process. See the instructions for lines 20a and 20b, later.  Overreported tax—claim process.  If you overreported tax on Form 941, you may choose to file a claim for refund or abatement on Form 941-X any time before the period of limitations on credit or refund expires on Form 941. If you also need to correct any underreported amounts, you must file another Form 941-X reporting only corrections to the underreported amounts. See Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X? next.      You may not file a refund claim to correct federal income tax or Additional Medicare Tax actually withheld from employees.     Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X? Generally, you may correct overreported taxes on a previously filed Form 941 if you file Form 941-X within 3 years of the date Form 941 was filed or 2 years from the date you paid the tax reported on Form 941, whichever is later. You may correct underreported taxes on a previously filed Form 941 if you file Form 941-X within 3 years of the date the Form 941 was filed. We call each of these time frames a \"period of limitations.\" For purposes of the period of limitations, Forms 941 for a calendar year are considered filed on April 15 of the succeeding year if filed before that date.  Example. You filed your 2013 fourth quarter Form 941 on January 27, 2014, and payments were timely made. The IRS treats the return as if it were filed on April 15, 2014. On January 20, 2017, you discovered that you overreported social security and Medicare wages on that form by $350. To correct the error you must file Form 941-X by April 18, 2017, which is the end of the period of limitations for Form 941, and use the claim process.       If you file Form 941-X to correct overreported amounts in the last 90 days of a period of limitations, you must use the claim process. You can’t use the adjustment process. If you’re also correcting underreported amounts, you must file another Form 941-X to correct the underreported amounts using the adjustment process and pay any tax due.     Where Should You File Form 941-X? Send your completed Form 941-X to the address shown next.       IF you’re in THEN use this address    Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin  Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service   Cincinnati, OH 45999-0005   Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming  Department of the Treasury   Internal Revenue Service   Ogden, UT 84201-0005   No legal residence or principal place of business in any state  Internal Revenue Service   P.O.

Use a Separate Form 941-X for Each Quarter You’re Correcting Use a separate Form 941-X for each Form 941 that you’re correcting. For example, if you found errors on your Forms 941 for the third and fourth quarters of 2016, file one Form 941-X to correct the 2016 third quarter Form 941. File a second Form 941-X to correct the 2016 fourth quarter Form 941.     EIN, Name, and Address Enter your EIN, name, and address in the spaces provided. Also enter your name and EIN on the top of pages 2 and 3, and on any attachments. If your address has changed since you filed your Form 941, enter the corrected information and the IRS will update your address of record. Be sure to write your name, EIN,\" Form 941-X,\" the calendar quarter you’re correcting (for example, \"Quarter 2\"), and the calendar year of the quarter you’re correcting on the top of any attachments.     Return You’re Correcting In the box at the top of page 1, check the type of return (Form 941 or Form 941-SS) you’re correcting. Check the appropriate box for the one quarter you’re correcting. Enter the calendar year of the Form 941 you’re correcting. Enter the quarter and calendar year on pages 2 and 3. Be sure to write your name, EIN, \"Form 941-X,\" the quarter you’re correcting (for example, \"Quarter 2\"), and the calendar year of the quarter you’re correcting on the top of any attachments.     Enter the Date You Discovered Errors You must enter the date you discovered errors. You discover an error when you have enough information to be able to correct it. If you’re reporting several errors that you discovered at different times, enter the earliest date you discovered them here. Report any subsequent dates and related errors on line 24.     Must You Make an Entry on Each Line? You must provide all of the information requested at the top of page 1. You must check one box (but not both) in Part 1. In Part 2, you must check the box on line 3 and any applicable boxes on lines 4 and 5. In Part 3, if any line doesn’t apply, leave it blank. Complete Parts 4 and 5 as instructed.     How Should You Report Negative Amounts? Form 941-X uses negative numbers to show reductions in tax (credits) and positive numbers to show additional tax (amounts you owe).  When reporting a negative amount in columns 3 and 4, use a minus sign instead of parentheses. For example, enter \"-10.59\" instead of \"(10.59).\" However, if you’re completing the return on your computer and your software only allows you to use parentheses to report negative amounts, you may use them.     How Should You Make Entries on Form 941-X? You can help the IRS process Form 941-X timely and accurately if you follow these guidelines.   Type or print your entries. Use Courier font (if possible) for all typed or computer-generated entries. Omit dollar signs. You may use commas and decimal points, if desired. Enter dollar amounts to the left of any preprinted decimal point and cents to the right of it. Always show an amount for cents. Don’t round entries to whole dollars. Complete all three pages and sign Form 941-X on page 3. Staple multiple sheets in the upper-left corner.        What About Penalties and Interest? Generally, your correction of an underreported amount won’t be subject to a failure-to-pay penalty, FTD penalty, or interest if you:  File on time (by the due date of the quarter in which you discover the error),  Pay the amount shown on line 21 by the time you file Form 941-X, Enter the date you discovered the error, and Explain in detail the grounds and facts relied on to support the correction.    No correction will be eligible for interest-free treatment if any of the following apply.  The amounts underreported relate to an issue that was raised in an examination of a prior period. You knowingly underreported your employment tax liability. You received a notice and demand for payment. You received a notice of determination under section 7436.    If you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet the reasonable-cause criteria. Don’t attach an explanation when you file your return.      Overview of the Process To correct a previously filed Form 941, use Form 941-X to file either an adjusted employment tax return or a claim for refund or abatement. The adjustment process and the claim process are outlined below.    If you underreported the tax. If you underreported the tax on a previously filed Form 941, check the box on line 1 and pay any additional amount you owe by the time you file Form 941-X. For details on how to make a payment, see the instructions for line 21, later.   Example—You underreported employment taxes. On June 19, 2017, you discover an error that results in additional tax on your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941. File Form 941-X by July 31, 2017, and pay the amount you owe by the time you file. See When Should You File Form 941-X, earlier. Don’t attach Form 941-X to your 2017 second quarter Form 941.     If you overreported the tax. If you overreported the tax on a previously filed Form 941, you may choose one of the following options.   Use the adjustment process. Check the box on line 1 to apply any credit (negative amount) from line 21 to Form 941 for the quarter during which you file Form 941-X.  Use the claim process. Check the box on line 2 to file a claim on Form 941-X requesting a refund or abatement of the amount shown on line 21.       To ensure that the IRS has enough time to process a credit for an overreporting adjustment in the quarter during which you file Form 941-X, you’re encouraged to file Form 941-X correcting the overreported amount in the first two months of a quarter. For example, if you discover an overreported amount in March, June, September, or December, you may want to file Form 941-X in the first two months of the next quarter. However, there must be 90 days remaining on the period of limitations when you file Form 941-X. See the Caution under Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X, earlier. This should ensure that the IRS will have enough time to process Form 941-X so the credit will be posted before you file Form 941, thus avoiding an erroneous balance due notice from the IRS. See the example below.       Example—You want your overreported tax applied as a credit to Form 941. On June 19, 2017, you discover you overreported your tax on your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941 and want to choose the adjustment process. To allow the IRS enough time to process the credit, you file Form 941-X on July 3, 2017, and take the credit on your third quarter 2017 Form 941.       If you currently file Form 944 and you’re making a correction to a previously filed Form 941 that will be claimed as a credit on Form 944, file Form 941-X before December in any year before the expiration of the period of limitations for the previously filed Form 941. In the year that the period of limitations for the previously filed Form 941 expires, file Form 941-X at least 90 days before the expiration date.     Specific Instructions:    Part 1: Select ONLY One Process Because Form 941-X may be used to file either an adjusted employment tax return or a claim for refund or abatement, you must check one box on either line 1 or line 2. Don’t check both boxes.    1. Adjusted Employment Tax Return Check the box on line 1 if you’re correcting underreported amounts or overreported amounts and you would like to use the adjustment process to correct the errors. If you’re correcting both underreported amounts and overreported amounts on this form, you must check this box. If you check this box, any negative amount shown on line 21 will be applied as a credit (tax deposit) to your Form 941 or Form 944 for the period in which you’re filing this form. See Example—You want your overreported tax applied as a credit to Form 941 above.  If you owe tax.   Pay the amount shown on line 21 by the time you file Form 941-X. Generally, you won’t be charged interest if you file on time, pay on time, enter the date you discovered the error, and explain the correction on line 24.    If you have a credit.  You overreported employment taxes (you have a negative amount on line 21) and want the IRS to apply the credit to Form 941 or Form 944 for the period during which you filed Form 941-X. The IRS will apply your credit on the first day of the Form 941 or Form 944 period during which you filed Form 941-X. However, the credit you show on Form 941-X, line 21, may not be fully available on your Form 941 or Form 944 if the IRS corrects it during processing or you owe other taxes, penalties, or interest. The IRS will notify you if your claimed credit changes or if the amount available as a credit on Form 941 or Form 944 was reduced because of unpaid taxes, penalties, or interest.     Don’t check the box on line 1 if you’re either: (a) correcting overreported amounts and the period of limitations on credit or refund for Form 941 will expire within 90 days of the date you file Form 941-X, or (b) claiming a credit for COBRA premium assistance payments and you reduced your deposits in anticipation of the credit. Instead, in either case, check the box on line 2 to file a Form 941-X under the claim process. See Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X, earlier. Also see the instructions for lines 20a and 20b, later.       2. Claim  Check the box on line 2 to use the claim process if you’re correcting overreported amounts only and you’re claiming a refund or abatement for the negative amount (credit) shown on line 21. Don’t check this box if you’re correcting any underreported amounts on this form. You must check the box on line 2 if you have a credit and the period of limitations on credit or refund for Form 941 will expire within 90 days of the date you file Form 941-X. See Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X, earlier. The IRS usually processes claims shortly after they are filed. The IRS will notify you if your claim is denied, accepted as filed, or selected to be examined. See Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, for more information. Unless the IRS corrects Form 941-X during processing or you owe other taxes, penalties, or interest, the IRS will refund the amount shown on line 21, plus any interest that applies.      You may not file a refund claim to correct federal income tax or Additional Medicare Tax actually withheld from employees.    Part 2: Complete the Certifications You must complete all certifications that apply by checking the appropriate boxes. If all of your corrections relate to underreported amounts, complete line 3 only; skip lines 4 and 5 and go to Part 3. If your corrections relate to overreported amounts, you have a duty to ensure that your employees\\' rights to recover overpaid employee social security and Medicare taxes that you withheld are protected. The certifications on lines 4 and 5 address the requirement to:  Repay or reimburse your employees for the overcollection of employee social security and Medicare taxes, or Obtain consents from your employees to file a claim on their behalf. See Rev. Proc. 2017-28 for guidance on the requirements for both a request for employee consent and for the employee consent.       3. Filing Forms W-2 or Forms W-2c Check the box on line 3 to certify that you filed or will file Forms W-2 or Forms W-2c with the SSA, as required, showing your employees\\' correct wage and tax amounts. See the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for detailed information about filing requirements. References to Form W-2 on Form 941-X and in these instructions also apply to Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, and W-2VI unless otherwise noted. You must check the box on line 3 to certify that you filed Forms W-2 or Forms W-2c even if your corrections on Form 941-X don’t change amounts shown on those forms. For example, if your only correction to Form 941 involves misstated tax adjustments (see the instructions for line 13, later), check the box on line 3 to certify that you already filed all required Forms W-2 and W-2c with the SSA.     4. Certifying Overreporting Adjustments If you overreported federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax and checked the box on line 1, check the appropriate box on line 4. You may need to check more than one box. If you obtained written statements from some employees but you couldn’t locate employees or secure the statements of the remaining employees, check all applicable boxes. Provide a summary on line 24 of the amount of the corrections both for the employees who provided written statements and for those who didn’t.  4a.  Check the box on line 4a if your overreported amount includes each affected employee share of overcollected taxes. You’re certifying that you repaid or reimbursed the employee share of current and prior year taxes and you received written statements from the employees stating that they didn’t and won’t receive a refund or credit for the prior year taxes. You’re certifying that you adjusted federal income tax or Additional Medicare Tax withheld from employees for the current calendar year only. Don’t send these statements to the IRS. Keep them for your records. Generally, all employment tax records must be kept for at least 4 years. Copies must be submitted to the IRS if requested.    4b.  Check the box on line 4b to certify that your overreported amount is only for the employer share of taxes on those employees who you were unable to find or those who didn’t give you a statement described on line 4a.    4c.  Check the box on line 4c to certify that your overreported amount is only for federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax that you didn’t withhold from your employees.       5. Certifying Claims If you’re filing a claim for refund or abatement of overreported federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax and checked the box on line 2, check the appropriate box on line 5. You may need to check more than one box. If you obtained written statements or consents from some employees but you couldn’t locate employees or secure the statements or consents of the remaining employees, check all applicable boxes. Provide a summary on line 24 of the amount of the corrections for both the employees who provided statements or consents and for those who didn’t.    You can’t file a refund claim to correct federal income tax or Additional Medicare Tax actually withheld from employees in a prior year. If you request their consent to file a claim for social security tax or Medicare tax, you must tell your employees that you can’t claim a refund of any Additional Medicare Tax on their behalf. See Rev. Proc. 2017-28 for sample language to use in your request.  5a.  Check the box on line 5a if your overreported tax includes each affected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes. You’re certifying that you repaid or reimbursed to the employees their share of social security and Medicare taxes. For refunds of employee social security and Medicare taxes overcollected in prior years, you’re certifying that you received written statements from those employees stating that they didn’t and won’t receive a refund or credit for the prior year taxes. Don’t send these statements to the IRS. Keep them for your records. Generally, all employment tax records must be kept for at least 4 years. Copies must be submitted to the IRS if requested.    5b.  Check the box on line 5b if your overreported tax includes each affected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes and you haven’t yet repaid or reimbursed the employee share of taxes. You’re certifying that you received consent from each affected employee to file a claim on the employee share of those taxes and you received written statements from those employees stating that they didn’t and won’t receive a refund or credit for the prior year taxes.  An employee consent must:  Contain the name, address, and social security number (or truncated taxpayer identification number, when appropriate) of the employee; Contain the name, address, and EIN of the employer; Contain the tax period(s), type of tax, and the amount of tax for which the consent is provided; Affirmatively state that the employee authorizes the employer to claim a refund for the overpayment of the employee share of tax; For amounts collected in a prior year, include the employee’s written statement certifying that the employee hasn’t made any previous claims (or the claims were rejected) and won’t make any future claims for refund or credit of the amount of the overcollection; Identify the basis of the claim; and Be dated and contain the employee’s signature under penalties of perjury. The penalties of perjury statement should be located immediately above the required signature.    Don’t send these statements and consents to the IRS. Keep them for your records. Generally, all employment tax records must be kept for at least 4 years. Copies must be submitted to the IRS if requested.   In certain situations, you may not have repaid or reimbursed your employees or obtained their consents prior to filing a claim, such as in cases where the period of limitations on credit or refund is about to expire. In those situations, file Form 941-X, but don’t check a box on line 5. Tell us on line 24 that you haven’t repaid or reimbursed employees or obtained consents at the time you file the claim. However, you must repay or reimburse your employees and certify that you’ve done so before the IRS can allow the claim.  5c.  Check the box on line 5c to certify that your overreported tax is only for the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes. This applies when affected employees didn’t give you consent to file a claim for refund for the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes, they couldn’t be found, or they didn’t give you a statement described on line 5b.    5d.  Check the box on line 5d to certify that your overreported amount is only for federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax that you didn’t withhold from your employees.        Part 3: Enter the Corrections for This Quarter    What Amounts Should You Report in Part 3? On lines 6–11, columns 1 and 2, show amounts for all of your employees, not just for those employees whose amounts you’re correcting. If a correction that you report in column 4 includes both underreported and overreported amounts (see the instructions for line 22, later), give us details for each error on line 24. Because special circumstances apply for lines 12–18, 20a, and 20b, read the instructions for each line carefully before entering amounts in the columns.     If you previously adjusted or amended Form 941 by using Form 941-X or because of an IRS examination change, show amounts in column 2 that include those previously reported corrections.      6. Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation If you’re correcting the wages, tips, and other compensation you reported on Form 941, line 2, enter the total corrected amount for all employees in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2. This line doesn’t apply to Form 941-SS. If you or the IRS previously corrected the amount reported on Form 941, line 2, enter in column 2 the amount after any previous corrections.           line 6 (column 1)       - line 6 (column 2)        line 6 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.       Example —Wages, tips, and other compensation increased. You reported $9,000 as total wages, tips, and other compensation on line 2 of your 2017 first quarter Form 941. In May of 2017, you discovered that you had overlooked $1,000 in tips for one of your part-time employees. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 10,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 2) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 1,000.00          Example —Wages, tips, and other compensation decreased. You reported $9,000 as wages, tips, and other compensation on line 2 of your 2017 first quarter Form 941. In May of 2017, you discovered that you included $2,000 in wages for one of your employees twice. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 7,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 2) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) -2,000.00          Example—Auto allowance; wages, tips, and other compensation increased. You paid one of your employees a $500 monthly auto allowance from October through December 2016, and didn’t treat the payments as taxable wages. In February 2017, you realized that the payments were wages because they weren’t reimbursements of deductible business expenses that were substantiated and paid under an accountable plan. You correct the error by treating the auto allowance as wages subject to income, social security, and Medicare taxes. Report the additional $1,500 of wages on lines 6, 8, and 10.     The amount on line 6, column 1, should be used on your Forms W-2 or Forms W-2c. This amount should also be used for any business expense deduction on your income tax return (or amended return) for wages paid.     7. Federal Income Tax Withheld from Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation If you’re correcting the federal income tax withheld from wages, tips, and other compensation you reported on Form 941, line 3, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2. This line doesn’t apply to Form 941-SS.           line 7 (column 1)       - line 7 (column 2)        line 7 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.    Copy the amount in column 3 to column 4. Include any minus sign shown in column 3.    Generally, you may correct federal income tax withholding errors only if you discovered the errors in the same calendar year you paid the wages. In addition, for an overcollection, you may correct federal income tax withholding only if you also repaid or reimbursed the employees in the same year. For prior years, you may only correct administrative errors to federal income tax withholding (that is, errors in which the amount reported on Form 941, line 3, doesn’t agree with the amount you withheld from an employee’s wages) and errors for which section 3509 rates apply. Only transposition or math errors involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount withheld are \"administrative errors\". See section 13 of Pub. 15 for more information about corrections during the calendar year and about administrative errors. See section 2 of Pub. 15 for more information about section 3509. If section 3509 rates apply, see the instructions for line 15, later.    You can’t file a Form 941-X to correct federal income tax withholding for prior years for nonadministrative errors. In other words, you can’t correct federal income tax actually withheld from an employee in a prior year if you discover that you didn’t withhold the right amount. For example, you can’t correct federal income tax withheld in a prior year because you used the wrong income tax withholding table in Pub. 15 or you didn’t treat a payment correctly as taxable or nontaxable. Similarly, if you paid federal income tax in a prior year on behalf of your employee, rather than deducting it from the employee’s pay (which resulted in additional wages subject to tax), and in a subsequent year you determine that you incorrectly calculated the amount of tax, you can’t correct the federal income tax withholding.  Example—Failure to withhold federal income tax when required. You were required to withhold $400 of federal income tax from an employee\\'s bonus that was paid in December of 2016 but you withheld nothing. You discovered the error on March 16, 2017. You can’t file Form 941-X to correct federal income tax withheld reported on your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941 because the error involves a previous year and the amount previously reported for the employee represents the actual amount withheld from the employee during 2016.   Example—Administrative error reporting federal income tax. You had three employees. In the fourth quarter of 2016, you withheld $1,000 of federal income tax from Xavier Black, $2,000 from Sophie Rose, and $6,000 from Leo Wood. The total amount of federal income tax you withheld was $9,000. You mistakenly reported $6,000 on line 3 of your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941. You discovered the error on March 13, 2017. This is an example of an administrative error that may be corrected in a later calendar year because the amount actually withheld from the employees\\' wages differs from the amount reported on Form 941. Use Form 941-X to correct the error. Enter $9,000 in column 1 and $6,000 in column 2. Subtract the amount in column 2 from the amount in column 1.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 9,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 3) - 6,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 3,000.00      Report the $3,000 as a tax correction in column 4. Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.   Example—Nonadministrative error reporting income tax due to repayment of wages paid in prior year. You paid Jack Brown $4,000 of wages for 2 months of work in September 2016. You withheld $400 of federal income tax at the time you paid Jack. These amounts were reported on your 2016 third quarter Form 941. Jack left employment in October 2016 (after only 1 month of service). After the end of the year, Jack repaid $2,000 to you. You can’t file Form 941-X to reduce the federal income tax withheld because you actually withheld the federal income tax from wages. You also can’t file Form 941-X to reduce wages because the wages were income to Jack for the prior year. These amounts were correctly reported on Form 941.      8. Taxable Social Security Wages If you’re correcting the taxable social security wages you reported on Form 941, line 5a, column 1, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.          line 8 (column 1)       - line 8 (column 2)       line 8 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.124 and enter that result in column 4.          line 8 (column 3)       x 0.124       line 8 (column 4)   If the amount in column 3 used a minus sign, also use a minus sign in column 4.        Note. If you’re correcting only the employer share of tax on a decrease to social security wages, use 0.062 (6.2%) when multiplying the amount shown in column 3. If you’re correcting both shares of tax for some employees and only the employer share for other employees, enter the properly calculated amount in column 4. Be sure to show your calculations on line 24.   Example—Social security wages decreased. Following Example—Wages, tips, and other compensation decreased in the instructions for line 6, the wages that you counted twice were also taxable social security wages. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 7,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5a, column 1) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) -2,000.00        Use the difference in column 3 to determine your tax correction.         Column 3 (difference) -2,000.00     Tax rate (12.4%)  x 0.124     Column 4 (tax correction)   -248.00         Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.     9. Taxable Social Security Tips If you’re correcting the taxable social security tips you reported on Form 941, line 5b, column 1, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.           line 9 (column 1)       - line 9 (column 2)       line 9 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.124 and report that result in column 4.          line 9 (column 3)       x 0.124       line 9 (column 4)   If the amount in column 3 used a minus sign, also use a minus sign in column 4.        Note. If you’re correcting only the employer share of tax on a decrease to social security tips, use 0.062 (6.2%) when multiplying the amount shown in column 3. If you’re correcting both shares of tax for some employees and only the employer share for other employees, report the properly calculated amount in column 4. Be sure to show your calculations on line 24.   Example—Social security tips increased. Following the Example—Wages, tips, and other compensation increased in the instructions for line 6, the tips that you overlooked were also taxable social security tips. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 10,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5b, column 1) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 1,000.00        Use the difference in column 3 to determine your tax correction.         Column 3 (difference) 1,000.00     Tax rate (12.4%)  x 0.124     Column 4 (tax correction)  124.00         Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.     10. Taxable Medicare Wages and Tips If you’re correcting the taxable Medicare wages and tips you reported on Form 941, line 5c, column 1, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.           line 10 (column 1)         - line 10 (column 2)          line 10 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.029 (2.9% tax rate) and enter that result in column 4.           line 10 (column 3)         x 0.029         line 10 (column 4)   If the amount in column 3 used a minus sign, also use a minus sign in column 4.        Note. If you’re correcting only the employer share of tax on a decrease to Medicare wages and tips, use 0.0145 (1.45%) when multiplying the amount in column 3. If you’re correcting both shares of tax for some employees and only the employer share for other employees, enter the properly calculated amount in column 4. Be sure to explain your calculations on line 24.   Example—Medicare wages and tips decreased. Following Example—Wages, tips, and other compensation decreased in the instructions for line 6, the wages that you counted twice were also taxable Medicare wages and tips. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 7,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5c, column 1) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) -2,000.00        Use the difference in column 3 to determine your tax correction.         Column 3 (difference)  -2,000.00     Tax rate (2.9%) x 0.029     Column 4 (tax correction)  -58.00        Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.      11. Taxable Wages and Tips Subject to Additional Medicare Tax Withholding Generally, you may correct errors to Additional Medicare Tax withholding only if you discovered the errors in the same calendar year the wages and tips were paid to employees. However, you may correct errors to Additional Medicare Tax withholding for prior years if the amount reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 2, doesn’t agree with the amount you actually withheld, including any amount you paid on behalf of your employee rather than deducting it from the employee’s pay (which resulted in additional wages subject to tax). This type of error is an administrative error. You may also correct errors to Additional Medicare Tax withholding for prior years if section 3509 rates apply. If section 3509 rates apply, see the instructions for line 18. If a prior year error was a nonadministrative error, you may correct only the wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding that were originally reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 1, or previously corrected on Form 941-X. You can’t correct the tax reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 2.  Errors discovered in the same calendar year or prior year administrative errors.  If you’re correcting the taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding that you reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 1, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.             line 11 (column 1)         - line 11 (column 2)          line 11 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate) and enter that result in column 4.           line 11 (column 3)         x 0.009         line 11 (column 4)   If the amount in column 3 used a minus sign, also use a minus sign in column 4.           Example—Prior year administrative error (incorrectly reported amount of Additional Medicare Tax actually withheld). Xavier Black\\'s wages exceeded the $200,000 withholding threshold for Additional Medicare Tax in November 2016. The total wages paid to Xavier for 2016 were $230,000. You withheld $270 ($30,000 x 0.009) from the Xavier\\'s wages. However, on your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941 you mistakenly reported $3,000 on line 5d, column 1, and Additional Medicare Tax withheld of $27 on line 5d, column 2. You discover the error on March 16, 2017. This is an example of an administrative error that may be corrected in a later calendar year because the amount actually withheld differs from the amount reported on your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941. Use Form 941-X, line 11, to correct the error as shown below.           Column 1 (corrected amount) 30,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5d, column 1) - 3,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 27,000.00        Use the difference in column 3 to determine your tax correction.         Column 3 (difference)  27,000.00     Tax rate (0.9%)  x 0.009     Column 4 (tax correction)     243.00        Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.   Prior year nonadministrative errors.  You may correct only the taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding that you reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 1. Enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.             line 11 (column 1)         - line 11 (column 2)          line 11 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Don’t multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate). Leave column 4 blank and explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.      Example—Prior year nonadministrative error (failure to withhold Additional Medicare Tax when required). Sophie Rose’s wages exceeded the $200,000 withholding threshold for Additional Medicare Tax in December 2016. The total wages paid to Sophie for 2016 were $220,000. You were required to withhold $180 ($20,000 x 0.009) but you withheld nothing and didn’t report an amount on line 5d of your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941. You discover the error on March 16, 2017. File Form 941-X to correct wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding for your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941, but you may not correct the Additional Medicare Tax withheld (column 4) because the error involves a previous year and the amount previously reported for Sophie represents the actual amount withheld from Sophie during 2016.   Combination of prior year administrative and nonadministrative errors.  If you’re reporting both administrative errors and nonadministrative errors for the same quarter of a prior year, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2. However, multiply only the amount of wages and tips reported in column 3 that are related to administrative errors by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate). Don’t multiply any wages and tips reported in column 3 that are related to nonadministrative errors by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate). Use line 24 to explain in detail your corrections. The explanation must include the reasons for the corrections and a breakdown of the amount reported in column 3 into the amounts related to administrative errors and nonadministrative errors.      Example—Combination of prior year administrative and nonadministrative errors. Xavier Black’s wages exceeded the $200,000 withholding threshold for Additional Medicare Tax in November 2016. The total wages paid to Xavier for 2016 were $230,000. You withheld $270 ($30,000 x 0.009) from Xavier\\'s wages. However, on your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941 you mistakenly reported $3,000 on line 5d, column 1, and Additional Medicare Tax withheld of $27 on line 5d, column 2. The difference in wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax related to this administrative error is $27,000 ($30,000 - $3,000). Sophie Rose‘s wages exceeded the $200,000 withholding threshold for Additional Medicare Tax in December 2016. The total wages paid to Sophie for 2016 were $220,000. You were required to withhold $180 ($20,000 x 0.009) but you withheld nothing and didn’t report Sophie\\'s $20,000 in wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding on line 5d of your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941. You discover both errors on March 16, 2017. Use Form 941-X, line 11, to correct the errors as shown below.           Column 1 (corrected amount) 50,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5d, column 1) - 3,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 47,000.00        Determine the portion of wages and tips reported in column 3 that is related to the administrative error ($47,000 - $20,000 (nonadministrative error) = $27,000 (administrative error)). Multiply this portion of column 3 by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate) to determine your tax correction.           Difference related to administrative error  27,000.00     Tax rate (0.9%) x 0.009     Column 4 (tax correction)  243.00        Be sure to explain the reasons for these corrections on line 24. You must also report that $20,000 of the amount shown in column 3 was related to the correction of a prior year nonadministrative error and $27,000 of the amount shown in column 3 was related to the correction of an administrative error.      12. Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand—Tax on Unreported Tips Enter any corrections, including amounts reported on Form 941, line 5f, to the tax due from a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand on line 12. The IRS issues a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand to advise an employer of the amount of tips received by employees who failed to report or underreported tips to the employer. An employer isn’t liable for the employer share of the social security and Medicare taxes on unreported tips until a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand for the taxes is made to the employer by the IRS.     13. Tax Adjustments Use line 13 to correct any adjustments reported on Form 941, lines 7–9. Enter in column 1 the total corrected amount for Form 941, lines 7–9. Enter in column 2 the total originally reported or previously corrected amounts from Form 941, lines 7–9. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.          line 13 (column 1)       -line 13 (column 2)        line 13 (column 3)             You may need to report negative numbers in any column. Make sure that the difference you enter in column 3 accurately represents the change to adjustments originally reported or previously corrected on Form 941, lines 7–9. Copy the amount in column 3 to column 4. Include any minus sign shown in column 3. On line 24, describe what you misreported on Form 941. Tell us if your adjustment is for fractions of cents, third-party sick pay, tips, or group-term life insurance.  Example—Current quarter\\'s third-party sick pay underreported. You reported $6,900 (shown as \"-6,900.00\") as a third-party sick pay adjustment (reduction to tax) on line 8 of your 2016 second quarter Form 941. You didn’t report any amounts on lines 7 and 9. Your third-party sick pay adjustment should’ve been $9,600 (shown as \"-9,600.00\") because your third-party sick pay payer withheld that amount of social security and Medicare taxes from your employees. You discovered the error in April of 2017. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) -9,600.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 8) - (6,900.00)     Column 3 (difference) -2,700.00        Here is how you would enter the numbers on Form 941-X.         Column 1 Column 2  Column 3   (corrected amount) (Form 941, line 8) (difference)    -9,600.00 -6,900.00 -2,700.00      Report \"-2,700.00\" as your correction in column 4.  In this example, you’re claiming a credit for $2,700 in overreported tax for your 2016 second quarter Form 941. Always enter the same amount in column 4 (including any minus sign) that you enter in column 3. Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.      14. Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities If you’re correcting the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities that you reported on Form 941, line 11, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2. Copy the amount in column 3 to column 4. However, to properly show the amount as a credit or balance due item, enter a positive number in column 3 as a negative number in column 4 or a negative number in column 3 as a positive number in column 4. You must attach a corrected Form 8974 and explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.     15–18. Special Additions to Wages for Federal Income Tax, Social Security Taxes, Medicare Taxes, and Additional Medicare Tax Section 3509 provides special rates for the employee share of income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, and Additional Medicare Tax withholding when workers are reclassified as employees in certain circumstances. The applicable rate depends on whether you filed required information returns. An employer can’t recover any tax paid under this provision from the employees. The full employer share of social security tax and Medicare tax is due for all reclassifications.   Note. Section 3509 rates aren’t available if you intentionally disregarded the requirements to withhold taxes from the employee, or if you withheld income tax but didn’t withhold social security and Medicare taxes. Section 3509 rates are also not available for certain statutory employees.  On lines 15–18 enter only corrections to wages resulting from reclassifying certain workers as employees when section 3509 rates are used to calculate the taxes. If the employer issued the required information returns, use the section 3509 rates as follows.  For social security taxes, use the employer rate of 6.2% plus 20% of the employee rate of 6.2%, for a total rate of 7.44% of wages. For Medicare taxes, use the employer rate of 1.45% plus 20% of the employee rate of 1.45%, for a total rate of 1.74% of wages. For Additional Medicare Tax; 0.18% (20% of the employee rate of 0.9%) of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. For income tax withholding, the rate is 1.5% of wages.    If the employer didn’t issue the required information returns, use the section 3509 rates as follows.  For social security taxes, use the employer rate of 6.2% plus 40% of the employee rate of 6.2%, for a total rate of 8.68% of wages. For Medicare taxes, use the employer rate of 1.45% plus 40% of the employee rate of 1.45%, for a total rate of 2.03% of wages. For Additional Medicare Tax; 0.36% (40% of the employee rate of 0.9%) of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. For income tax withholding, the rate is 3.0% of wages.    Unlike other lines on Form 941-X, enter in column 1 only the corrected wages for workers being reclassified, not the amount paid to all employees. Enter in column 2 previously reported wages (if any) to reclassified employees. To get the amount for column 4, use the applicable section 3509 rates. If you filed the required information returns for some employees but didn’t file them for other employees, be sure to use the applicable rates for each employee when calculating the amounts in column 4 and show your calculations on line 24. The tax correction in column 4 will be a positive number if you increased the amount of wages you previously reported. See the instructions for line 23, later, for more information.     19. Subtotal Combine the amounts from column 4 on lines 7–18.  Example. You entered \"1,400.00\" in column 4 on line 7, \"-500.00\" in column 4 on line 8, and \"-100.00\" in column 4 on line 10. Combine these amounts and enter \"800.00\" in column 4 on line 19.         Line 7 1,400.00     Line 8 -500.00     Line 10  -100.00     Line 19 800.00             20a. Claiming or Correcting the COBRA Premium Assistance Credit    The COBRA premium assistance credit was available to an employer for premiums paid on behalf of employees who were involuntarily terminated from employment between September 1, 2008 and May 31, 2010. The COBRA premium assistance credit isn’t available for individuals who were involuntarily terminated after May 31, 2010. Therefore, only in rare circumstances, such as instances where COBRA eligibility was delayed as a result of employer provided health insurance coverage following termination, will the credit be available. Enter 65% of the total COBRA premium assistance payments for all assistance-eligible individuals in column 1. Report the premium assistance payments on this line only after the assistance-eligible individual\\'s 35% share of the premium has been paid. For COBRA coverage provided under a self-insured plan, COBRA premium assistance is treated as having been made for each assistance-eligible individual who paid 35% of the COBRA premium. Don’t include the assistance-eligible individual\\'s 35% of the premium in the amount entered on this line. For tax periods ending before January 1, 2014, enter any COBRA premium assistance payments previously claimed on Form 941 or 941-SS, line 12a, in column 2. For tax periods beginning after December 31, 2013, enter -0- in column 2, unless you’re correcting a COBRA premium assistance payment previously reported on a Form 941-X. If you or the IRS previously corrected the amount reported, the amount entered in column 2 should take into account all previous corrections. Enter the difference between column 1 and 2 in column 3. Copy the amount in column 3 to column 4. However, to properly show the amount as a credit or balance due item, enter a positive number in column 3 as a negative number in column 4 or a negative number in column 3 as a positive number in column 4.    The COBRA premium assistance credit is treated as a credit on the first day of the return period (that is, January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). However, because the credit is now claimed on Form 941-X filed after submission of the Form 941, an employer that reduces its required deposits in anticipation of the credit will receive a system-generated notice reflecting a balance due and associated penalties and interest, if applicable. The balance due, including any related penalties and interest, resulting from the reduction in deposits in anticipation of the credit will be abated when the credit is applied. Such abatement will generally occur without any further action from the employer. Alternatively, to prevent triggering a system-generated balance due notice, the employer can make its deposits without a reduction in anticipation of the COBRA premium assistance credit and follow these instructions for claiming the COBRA premium assistance credit. For more information on the COBRA premium subsidy, visit IRS.gov and enter \"COBRA\" in the search box.     20b. Number of Individuals Provided COBRA Premium Assistance on line 20a Enter the total number of assistance-eligible individuals provided COBRA premium assistance in column 1. Count each assistance-eligible individual who paid a reduced COBRA premium in the quarter as one individual, whether or not the reduced premium was for insurance that covered more than one assistance-eligible individual. For example, if the reduced COBRA premium was for coverage for a former employee, spouse, and two children, you would include one individual in the number entered on line 20b for the premium assistance entered on line 20a. Further, each individual is reported only once per quarter. For example, an assistance-eligible individual who made monthly premium payments during the quarter would only be reported as one individual on line 20b for that quarter. For tax periods ending before January 1, 2014, enter the number of assistance-eligible individuals provided COBRA premium assistance previously reported on Form 941 or 941-SS, line 12b, in column 2. For tax periods beginning after December 31, 2013, enter -0- in column 2, unless you’re correcting a previously filed Form 941-X. If you or the IRS previously corrected the number of individuals reported, the number entered in column 2 should take into account all previous corrections.     21. Total Combine the amounts on lines 19 and 20a of column 4 and enter the result on line 21.  Your credit.  If the amount entered on line 21 is less than zero, for example, \"-115.00,\" you have a credit because you overreported your federal employment taxes.  If you checked the box on line 1, include this amount on Form 941, line 13 (\"Total deposits\" line), for the quarter during which you filed Form 941-X or Form 944 \"Total deposits\" line, for the year during which you filed Form 941-X. Don’t make any changes to your record of federal tax liability reported on Form 941, line 16, or Schedule B (Form 941), if your Form 941-X is filed timely. The amounts reported on the record should reflect your actual tax liability for the period. If you checked the box on line 2, you’re filing a claim for refund or abatement of the amount shown.    If your credit is less than $1, we will send a refund or apply it only if you ask us in writing to do so.    Amount you owe.  If the amount on line 21 is a positive number, you must pay the amount you owe by the time you file Form 941-X. You may not use any credit that you show on another Form 941-X to pay the amount you owe, even if you filed for the amount you owe and the credit at the same time. If you owe tax and are filing a timely Form 941-X, don’t file an amended Schedule B (Form 941) unless you were assessed an FTD penalty caused by an incorrect, incomplete, or missing Schedule B (Form 941). Don’t include the tax increase reported on Form 941-X on any amended Schedule B (Form 941) you file. If you owe tax and are filing a late Form 941-X, that is, after the due date for Form 941 for the quarter in which you discovered the error, you must file an amended Schedule B (Form 941) with the Form 941-X. Otherwise, the IRS may assess an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. The total tax reported on the \"Total liability for the quarter\" line of Schedule B (Form 941) must match the corrected tax (Form 941, line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017), combined with any correction reported on Form 941-X, line 19) for the quarter, less any previous abatements and interest-free tax assessments.    Payment methods. You may pay the amount you owe on line 21 electronically using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), by credit or debit card, or by a check or money order.  The preferred method of payment is EFTPS. For more information, visit EFTPS.gov, call EFTPS Customer Service at 1-800-555-4477 or 1-800-733-4829 (TDD), or see Pub. 966. To pay by credit or debit card, visit the IRS website at  IRS.gov/payments. If you pay by check or money order, make it payable to \"United States Treasury.\" On your check or money order, be sure to write your EIN, \"Form 941-X,\" the calendar quarter you corrected (for example, \"Quarter 2\"), and the calendar year of the quarter you corrected.     You don’t have to pay if the amount you owe is less than $1.      Previously assessed FTD penalty.  If line 21 reflects overreported tax and the IRS previously assessed an FTD penalty, you may be able to reduce the penalty. For more information, see the Instructions for Schedule B (Form 941).       Part 4: Explain Your Corrections for This Quarter    22. Correction of Both Underreported and Overreported Amounts Check the box on line 22 if any corrections you entered on lines 7-20a, column 3, reflect both underreported and overreported amounts.  Example. If you had an increase to social security wages of $15,000 for Xavier Black and a decrease to social security wages of $5,000 for Sophie Rose, you would enter $10,000 on line 8, column 3. That $10,000 represents the net change from corrections. On line 24, you must explain the reason for both the $15,000 increase and the $5,000 decrease.      23. Did You Reclassify Any Workers? Check the box on line 23 if you reclassified any workers to be independent contractors or nonemployees. Also check this box if the IRS (or you) determined that workers you treated as independent contractors or nonemployees should be classified as employees. On line 24, give us a detailed reason why any worker was reclassified and, if you used section 3509 rates on lines 15–18, for any worker reclassified as an employee, explain why section 3509 rates apply and what rates you used.  Return not filed because you didn’t treat any workers as employees.  If you didn’t previously file Form 941 because you mistakenly treated all workers as independent contractors or as nonemployees, file a Form 941 for each delinquent quarter. On each Form 941 for which you’re entitled to use section 3509 rates, complete the following steps.  Write                                \"Misclassified Employees\"                             in bold letters across the top margin of page 1. Enter a zero on line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017). Complete the signature area. Attach a completed Form 941-X (see instructions next).    On each Form 941-X complete the following steps.  Complete the top of Form 941-X, including the date you discovered the error. Enter the wage amounts on lines 15–18, column 1. Enter zeros on lines 15–18, column 2. Complete columns 3 and 4 as instructed in Part 3. Provide a detailed statement on line 24. Complete the signature area.       If you can’t use section 3509 rates (for example, because the workers you treated as nonemployees were certain statutory employees), file a Form 941 for each delinquent quarter. Write \"                      Misclassified Employees                   \" in bold letters across the top margin of page 1 of each Form 941. Complete Form 941 using the Instructions for Form 941. Attach a Form 941-X to each Form 941. Complete the top of Form 941-X, including the date you discovered the error, and provide a detailed explanation on line 24.       24. Explain Your Corrections Treasury regulations require you to explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to support each correction. On line 24, describe in detail each correction you entered in column 4 on lines 7-18 and 20a. Also use line 24 to describe corrections made on lines 6 and 20b. If you need more space, attach additional sheets, but be sure to write your name, EIN, \"Form 941-X,\" the quarter you’re correcting (for example, \"Quarter 2\"), and the calendar year of the quarter you’re correcting on the top of each sheet. You must describe the events that caused the underreported or overreported amounts. Explanations such as \"social security and Medicare wages were overstated\" or \"administrative/payroll errors were discovered\" or \"taxes were not withheld\" are insufficient and may delay processing your Form 941-X because the IRS may need to ask for a more complete explanation.  Provide the following information in your explanation for each correction.  Form 941-X line number(s) affected. Date you discovered the error. Difference (amount of the error). Cause of the error.  You may report the information in paragraph form. The following paragraph is an example.                 \"The $1,000 difference shown in column 3 on lines 6, 8, and 10 was discovered on May 15, 2017, during an internal payroll audit. We discovered that we included $1,000 of wages for one of our employees twice. This correction removes the reported wages that were never paid.\"               For corrections shown on lines 15–18, column 3, explain why the correction was necessary and attach any notice you received from the IRS.

Revised: 04/2015      Instrucciones para  el Formulario 941-X (PR) - Introductory Material    Acontecimientos Futuros Para obtener la información más reciente sobre los acontecimientos relacionados al Formulario 941-X (PR) y sus instrucciones, como legislación promulgada después de que dichos documentos se hayan publicado, por favor visite www.irs.gov/form941xpr.     Qué Hay de Nuevo  Consentimiento del empleado para apoyar una reclamación de reembolso.  El Aviso 2015-15, en inglés, proporciona orientación a los patronos sobre los requisitos a seguir para la utilización de los consentimientos de los empleados para apoyar el derecho a reclamar un reembolso de la contribución al Seguro Social y de la contribución al Medicare recaudadas en exceso. El aviso y el procedimiento contributivo propuesto aclaran los requisitos básicos para una solicitud de consentimiento y el consentimiento del empleado en sí, y permite que un consentimiento se pida, se proporcione y se retenga en un formato electrónico como forma alternativa a un formato en papel. El aviso también solicita comentarios y contiene orientación sobre lo que constituye \"esfuerzos razonables\", en caso de que un consentimiento no se obtenga para permitir que el patrono reclame el reembolso de la parte correspondiente al patrono de la contribución al Seguro Social y de la contribución al Medicare recaudadas en exceso. Para obtener más información, consulte el Aviso 2015-15, que se encuentra en la  página 687 del Internal Revenue Bulletin (Boletín de Rentas Internas) 2015-9, disponible en inglés, en www.irs.gov/irb/2015-9_IRB/ar07.html.    Aumento retroactivo de beneficios de transporte excluibles.  La Ley de Prevención de Aumento de Impuestos de 2014 aumentó la exclusión de beneficios de transporte de $130 por mes por empleado participante a $250 por mes por empleado participante para el período del 1 de enero de 2014 al 31 de diciembre de 2014. A los patronos se les proporcionaron instrucciones sobre cómo corregir las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare sobre los beneficios de transporte en exceso en el Aviso 2015-2, que aparece en la página 334 del Internal Revenue Bulletin (Boletín de Rentas Internas) 2015-4, en inglés, disponible en www.irs.gov/irb/2015-4_IRB/ar06.html.       Recordatorios  Reclamación del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA.  El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA estuvo disponible a los patronos por las primas pagadas en nombre de empleados que fueron cesados involuntariamente de sus empleos entre el 1 de septiembre de 2008 y el 31 de mayo de 2010. El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA no está disponible para las personas que fueron cesadas involuntariamente después del 31 de mayo de 2010. Por lo tanto, sólo en circunstancias fuera de lo común el crédito está disponible, tal como los casos en que la elegibilidad de COBRA se haya retrasado a consecuencia de la cobertura de seguro de salud provista por el patrono después del cese. Si usted reúne los requisitos para reclamar el crédito, use las  líneas 19a y 19b del Formulario 941-X (PR). Deberá radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) después que radique el Formulario 941-PR. Radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) antes de radicar el Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre podría resultar en errores o demoras en la tramitación de su Formulario 941-X (PR). Si desea más información, visite IRS.gov e ingrese                    \"COBRA\"                 en el encasillado Search (Buscar). La información está disponible en inglés.    Si usted tiene derecho a reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA pero de otra manera no se le requiere radicar el Formulario 941-PR, radique el Formulario 941-PR con \"-0-\" anotado en la línea 12 antes de radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) para reclamar el crédito.    El plazo de prescripción para efectuar ciertas correcciones ha vencido.  Por lo general, usted puede corregir contribuciones declaradas en exceso en un Formulario 941-PR que se ha radicado previamente si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) dentro de 3 años a partir de la fecha de radicación del Formulario 941-PR o 2 años a partir de la fecha en que pagó la contribución declarada en el Formulario 941-PR, lo que sea más tarde. Para propósitos del plazo de prescripción, los Formularios 941-PR correspondientes a un año natural se consideran radicados el 15 de abril del próximo año si éstos se radican antes de esa fecha. El plazo de prescripción para corregir la exención contributiva calificada del patrono sobre los salarios/propinas pagados a empleados calificados (para los trimestres que terminaron después del 31 de marzo de 2010 y antes del 1 de enero de 2011) y el crédito contributivo calificado del patrono sobre los salarios/propinas pagados a empleados calificados entre el 19 y 31 de marzo de 2010 venció el 15 de abril de 2014 para las mayoría de los patronos.

Corrección del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA.   Para los períodos contributivos que terminaron antes del 1 de enero de 2014, los patronos que efectuaron pagos de asistencia para las primas de COBRA a favor de individuos que cumplen los requisitos para recibir dicha ayuda se les permitió un crédito en el Formulario 941-PR. Cualesquiera errores descubiertos en un Formulario 941-PR radicado previamente para este crédito se corrigen en las  líneas 19a y 19b del Formulario 941-X (PR).

Para los años 2011 y 2012, la tasa de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al empleado era 4.2% y la tasa correspondiente al patrono era 6.2% (para un total de 10.4%). Asegúrese de utilizar la tasa correcta al informar las correcciones en las  líneas 8 y 9.      Instrucciones Generales:Información para entender el Formulario 941-X (PR)     ¿Cuál es el propósito del Formulario 941-X (PR)?    Para los períodos contributivos que comienzan después del 31 de diciembre de 2013, el Formulario 941-PR no se puede utilizar para reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA. En vez, utilice el Formulario 941-X (PR) para reclamarlo. Para más información, vea las instrucciones para las  líneas 19a y 19b, más adelante. Use el Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir errores en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente. Use el Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir:  Salarios, propinas y otra remuneración; Salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social; Propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social; Salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare;  Salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare y Créditos por pagos de asistencia para las primas de COBRA.    Use el Formulario 843, Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement (Reclamación de reembolso y solicitud de reducción en la contribución), en inglés, para solicitar un reembolso o reducción en los intereses o multas que le han sido tasados. No solicite un reembolso o la reducción de multas o intereses en los Formularios 941-PR ni 941-X (PR).    Los términos \"corregir\" y \"correcciones\" se usan en el Formulario 941-X (PR) y en estas instrucciones para incluir los ajustes libres de intereses conforme a las secciones 6205 y 6413 y las reclamaciones de reembolso y de reducción de contribuciones conforme a las secciones 6402, 6414 y 6404. Vea la Reglamentación del Tesoro 2009-39 para ejemplos de cómo se aplican las reglas de ajustes libres de intereses y reclamación de reembolso en 10 situaciones diferentes. Puede ver la Reglamentación del Tesoro 2009-39 en la página 951 del Boletín de Rentas Internas 2009-52, en inglés, en el sitio web  www.irs.gov/irb/2009-52_IRB/ar14.html. Cuando descubra un error en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente, usted tiene que:  Corregir el error por medio del Formulario 941-X (PR), Radicar un Formulario 941-X (PR) por separado por cada Formulario 941-PR que está corrigiendo y Radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) por separado. No radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) junto con el Formulario 941-PR.    Si no radicó un Formulario 941-PR para uno o más trimestres, no use el Formulario 941-X (PR). En vez, radique el Formulario 941-PR por cada uno de esos trimestres. Consulte también el tema titulado ¿Cuándo debe radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, más adelante. Sin embargo, si no radicó el Formulario 941-PR debido a que trató (clasificó) incorrectamente a empleados como si fueran contratistas independientes o trabajadores que no son empleados (nonemployees) y ahora los reclasifica como empleados, consulte las instrucciones para la línea 22, más adelante. Declare la corrección de las cantidades declaradas de menos y las declaradas en exceso correspondientes al mismo período contributivo en un solo Formulario 941-X (PR), a menos que esté solicitando un reembolso o una reducción. Si solicita un reembolso o reducción y está corrigiendo las cantidades declaradas de menos y las declaradas en exceso, radique un Formulario 941-X (PR) que corrige sólo las cantidades declaradas de menos y un segundo Formulario 941-X (PR) que corrige las cantidades declaradas en exceso. Usted usará el proceso de ajuste si declaró contribuciones sobre la nómina insuficientes (de menos) y está haciendo un pago, o si declaró en exceso dichas contribuciones y estará aplicando el crédito al período del Formulario 941-PR durante el cual radica el Formulario 941-X (PR). No obstante, vea la Precaución, bajo el tema titulado ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, más adelante, si está corrigiendo cantidades declaradas en exceso durante los últimos 90 días del plazo de prescripción. Usará el proceso de reclamación si declaró contribuciones sobre la nómina en exceso y está solicitando el reembolso o la reducción de la cantidad declarada en exceso. Consulte la tabla en el dorso del Formulario 941-X (PR) para obtener información que le ayudará a determinar si debe utilizar el proceso de ajuste o el proceso de reclamación.

Radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) cuando descubra un error en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente. Sin embargo, si los únicos errores del Formulario 941-PR están relacionados con el número de empleados que recibieron salarios o con las obligaciones contributivas federales declaradas en la Parte 2 del Formulario 941-PR o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), Registro de la Obligación Contributiva para los Depositantes de Itinerario Bisemanal, no radique el Formulario 941-X (PR).

Fechas de vencimiento.  La fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) depende de cuándo se descubrió el error y si se declararon las contribuciones de menos o en exceso. Si declaró contribuciones de menos, consulte el tema Contribución declarada de menos, más adelante. Para las contribuciones declaradas en exceso, puede optar por hacer un ajuste libre de intereses o por radicar una reclamación de reembolso o de reducción de contribuciones. Si está corrigiendo cantidades declaradas en exceso, consulte el tema Contribución declarada en exceso —proceso de ajuste, o el tema Contribución declarada en exceso —proceso de reclamación, a continuación. Si la fecha de vencimiento es un sábado, domingo o día feriado legal, puede radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) el próximo día laborable. Si recibimos el Formulario 941-X (PR) después de la fecha de vencimiento, se tratará dicho formulario como si hubiera sido radicado a tiempo si el sobre que contiene el Formulario 941-X (PR) está debidamente rotulado, tiene suficiente franqueo y el matasellos del Servicio Postal de los Estados Unidos está fechado a más tardar en la fecha de vencimiento, o si se envió por medio de un servicio de entrega privado aceptado por el IRS a más tardar en la fecha de vencimiento. Si no sigue estas pautas, consideramos que el Formulario 941-X (PR) fue radicado en la fecha en que realmente se recibió. Consulte la Pub. 179 (Circular PR) para obtener más información acerca de los días feriados oficiales y los servicios de entrega privados aceptados por el IRS.    Contribución declarada de menos.

Por lo general, si hace esto asegurará que su corrección sea libre de intereses y que no esté sujeta a multas por no pagar o no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés). Consulte el tema ¿Y las multas e intereses?, más adelante. Para más detalles sobre cómo efectuar un pago, vea las instrucciones de la línea 20, más adelante. Si se radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) tarde (después de la fecha de vencimiento de la planilla para el período de la planilla en el cual usted descubrió el error), tiene que adjuntar un Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) enmendado al Formulario 941-X (PR). De lo contrario, el IRS le podrá imponer una multa \"promediada\" por no depositar (FTD). El total de la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea \"                   Obligación total para el trimestre                \" del Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) tiene que ser igual a la cantidad total de contribuciones (línea 10 del Formulario 941-PR combinado con cualquier corrección declarada en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.              Si descubre el error en   El Formulario  941-X (PR) vence el                  1. enero, febrero, marzo       30 de abril     2. abril, mayo, junio       31 de julio     3. julio, agosto, septiembre       31 de octubre      4. octubre, noviembre, diciembre       31 de enero                  Las fechas indicadas en esta tabla corresponden sólo a las correcciones hechas debido a cantidades declaradas de menos. Si la fecha de vencimiento es un sábado, domingo o día feriado legal, puede radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) el próximo día laborable.      Ejemplo: Usted adeuda contribuciones. El 11 de febrero de 2015 descubre que declaró $10,000 de menos por concepto de salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014. Radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) y pague la cantidad que adeuda para el 30 de abril de 2015, porque descubrió el error en el primer trimestre de 2015 y el 30 de abril de 2015 es la fecha de vencimiento para ese trimestre. Si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) antes del 30 de abril de 2015, pague la cantidad que adeuda en el momento en que radica dicho formulario.   Contribución declarada en exceso —proceso de ajuste.  Si declaró contribuciones en exceso en el Formulario 941-PR y optó por aplicar el crédito al Formulario 941-PR o 944(SP), radique una planilla ajustada utilizando el Formulario 941-X (PR) tan pronto descubra el error, pero más de 90 días antes de que venza el plazo de prescripción para el crédito o reembolso del Formulario 941-PR. Consulte el tema titulado ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, más adelante.      Si usted redujo sus depósitos durante el trimestre por la cantidad del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA que se reflejará en su Formulario 941-X (PR), no use el proceso de ajuste para reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA. Use el proceso de reclamación. Vea las instrucciones para las  líneas 19a y 19b, más adelante.  Contribución declarada en exceso —proceso de reclamación.  Si declaró contribuciones en exceso en el Formulario 941-PR, puede optar por radicar una reclamación de reembolso o reducción de contribución en el Formulario 941-X (PR) en cualquier momento antes de que venza el período de prescripción para el crédito o reembolso del Formulario 941-PR. Si también necesita corregir cantidad alguna declarada de menos, tiene que radicar otro Formulario 941-X (PR) donde declara sólo las correcciones hechas por cantidades declaradas de menos. Consulte el tema ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, a continuación.      Usted no puede radicar una reclamación de reembolso para corregir la Contribución Adicional al Medicare retenida realmente de los empleados.     ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)? Por lo general, puede corregir las contribuciones declaradas en exceso en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) dentro de un plazo de 3 años a partir de la fecha en que radicó el Formulario 941-PR o 2 años a partir de la fecha en que pagó la contribución declarada en el Formulario 941-PR, lo que ocurra más tarde. Puede corregir contribuciones declaradas de menos en un Formulario 941-PR radicado anteriormente si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) dentro de 3 años de la fecha en que el Formulario 941-PR fue radicado. A cada uno de estos plazos se le llama \"plazo de prescripción\". Para propósitos del plazo de prescripción, los Formularios 941-PR que usted radicó para el año natural se consideran radicados el 15 de abril del próximo año natural si se radican antes de esa fecha.  Ejemplo. Usted radicó el Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2012 el 27 de enero de 2013 y los pagos fueron hechos a tiempo. El IRS tramita su planilla como si hubiera sido radicada el 15 de abril de 2013. El 22 de enero de 2016, usted descubre que declaró $350 en exceso por concepto de salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare en ese formulario. Para corregir el error, tiene que radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) a más tardar el 18 de abril de 2016, fecha en que finaliza el plazo de prescripción para el Formulario 941-PR, y usar el proceso de reclamación.     Si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir cantidades declaradas en exceso en los últimos 90 días del plazo de prescripción, tiene que usar el proceso de reclamación. No puede usar el proceso de ajuste. Si también corrige cantidades declaradas de menos, tiene que radicar otro Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir las cantidades declaradas de menos utilizando el proceso de ajuste y tiene que pagar toda contribución adeudada.     ¿Adónde deberá enviar el Formulario 941-X (PR)? Complete y envíe su Formulario 941-X (PR) a la dirección que se le indica a continuación:       SI envía el  Formulario 941-X (PR) ENTONCES use esta  dirección    Desde Puerto Rico. . . .   Internal Revenue Service  P.O. Box 409101  Ogden, UT 84409     Dirección especial para la radicación por parte de organizaciones exentas; entidades gubernamentales federales, estatales y locales; entidades de gobiernos tribales indios sin consideración de su ubicación. . . .   Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service  Ogden, UT 84201-0005           ¿Cómo se debe completar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?    Use un Formulario 941-X (PR) por separado para cada trimestre que corrija Use un Formulario 941-X (PR) por separado para cada Formulario 941-PR que corrija. Por ejemplo, si encontró errores en sus Formularios 941-PR del tercer y cuarto trimestre de 2014, radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir el Formulario 941-PR del tercer trimestre de 2014. Radique un segundo Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir el Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014.     Número de identificación patronal, nombre y dirección Anote su número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés), nombre y dirección en los espacios provistos. También anote su nombre y su EIN en la parte superior de las páginas 2 y 3, y en todo documento adjunto. Si su dirección ha cambiado desde que radicó el Formulario 941-PR, anote la información corregida y el IRS actualizará su dirección en sus registros. Asegúrese de escribir su nombre, EIN, \"Formulario 941-X (PR)\", el trimestre natural que está corrigiendo (por ejemplo, \"2do Trimestre\") y el año natural del trimestre que está corrigiendo en la parte superior de todo documento que adjunte.     Planilla que está corrigiendo Marque la casilla para el Formulario 941-PR que aparece en el encasillado en la parte superior derecha de la página 1 del Formulario 941-X (PR). Luego marque la casilla para indicar el trimestre (sólo uno) que está corrigiendo. Anote el año natural que le corresponde al Formulario 941-PR que está corrigiendo. Anote el trimestre y el año natural en las páginas 2 y 3. Asegúrese de escribir su nombre, EIN, \"Formulario 941-X (PR)\", el trimestre que está corrigiendo (por ejemplo, \"2do Trimestre\") y el año natural del trimestre que está corrigiendo en la parte superior de todo documento que adjunte.     Anote la fecha en que descubrió los errores Usted tiene que anotar la fecha en que descubrió los errores. Usted descubre un error cuando tiene suficiente información para poder corregirlo. Si está declarando varios errores que descubrió en momentos distintos, anote la fecha más temprana en que los descubrió. Declare en la línea 23 las fechas subsiguientes y los errores correspondientes.     ¿Tiene que hacer una anotación en cada línea? Tiene que facilitar toda la información solicitada en la parte superior de la página 1. Tiene que marcar una casilla (pero no ambas) en la Parte 1. En la Parte 2, tiene que marcar la casilla en la línea 3 y toda casilla que le corresponda en las líneas 4 y 5. En la Parte 3, si no le corresponde alguna línea, déjela en blanco. Complete las Partes 4 y 5 tal como se le indica.     ¿Cómo debe declarar una cantidad negativa? El Formulario 941-X (PR) usa cifras negativas para indicar las reducciones en contribuciones (créditos) y cifras positivas para indicar contribuciones adicionales (cantidades que usted adeuda). Al declarar una cantidad negativa en las columnas 3 y 4, use un signo de menos en vez de usar paréntesis. Por ejemplo, anote \"-10.59\" en vez de \"(10.59)\". Sin embargo, si está completando la planilla en su computadora y el software sólo le permite usar paréntesis para declarar cantidades negativas, puede usarlos.     ¿Cómo se deben hacer anotaciones en el Formulario 941-X (PR)? Usted puede ayudar al IRS a tramitar el Formulario 941-X (PR) con mayor diligencia y exactitud si sigue las siguientes pautas:  Escriba a maquinilla o en letra de molde. Use la fuente Courier (si es posible) para toda anotación hecha a maquinilla o por computadora. Omita los signos de dólar. Puede usar comas y puntos decimales, si así lo prefiere. Anote las cantidades en dólares a la izquierda del punto decimal que aparece impreso y la cantidad de centavos a la derecha de dicho punto. Siempre anote la cantidad de centavos. No redondee las cifras (cantidades) a dólares enteros. Complete las tres páginas y firme el Formulario 941-X (PR) en la página 3. Engrape las páginas en conjunto en la esquina superior izquierda.        ¿Y las multas e intereses? Por lo general, la corrección que hace debido a una cantidad declarada de menos no estará sujeta a una multa por no pagar, multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) o intereses si usted:  Radica a tiempo (para la fecha de vencimiento del trimestre en que descubrió el error), Paga la cantidad indicada en la línea 20  en el momento que radica el Formulario 941-X (PR), Anota la fecha en que descubrió el error y Explica en detalle las razones y los hechos en que se basa para hacer la corrección.    Ninguna corrección cumplirá con los requisitos del trato libre de intereses si alguno de los siguientes aplica:  Las cantidades declaradas de menos están relacionadas con un tema que surgió durante una revisión de un período anterior. Usted a sabiendas declaró de menos su obligación contributiva sobre la nómina. Recibió una notificación y solicitud de pago. Recibió una carta titulada, Notice of Determination of Worker Classification (Determinación de la clasificación de un trabajador), en inglés.    Si recibe una notificación sobre una multa después que radica esta declaración, responda a la notificación con una explicación y determinaremos si cumple los requisitos de lo que se consideran causas razonables. No adjunte dicha explicación cuando radique su declaración.      Reseña del proceso El proceso para un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente o para radicar una reclamación de reembolso se explica en términos generales a continuación.    Si declaró la contribución de menos. Si declaró la contribución de menos en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente, marque la casilla en la línea 1 y pague toda cantidad adicional que adeuda en el momento en que radica el Formulario 941-X (PR). Para más detalles sobre cómo efectuar un pago, vea las instrucciones para la línea 20, más adelante.   Ejemplo: Usted declaró contribuciones sobre la nómina de menos. El 19 de junio de 2015, descubrió un error que resulta en contribuciones adicionales en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014. Radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) para el 31 de julio de 2015 y pague la cantidad que adeuda en el momento en que radique. Consulte el tema ¿Cuándo debe radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, anteriormente. No adjunte el Formulario 941-X (PR) a su Formulario 941-PR del segundo trimestre de 2015.     Si declaró contribuciones en exceso. Si declaró contribuciones en exceso en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente, puede optar por una de las siguientes opciones:   Usar el proceso de ajuste. Marque la casilla en la línea 1 para que se le aplique todo crédito (cantidad negativa) de la línea 20 al Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre en que radica el Formulario 941-X (PR).  Usar el proceso de reclamación. Marque la casilla en la línea 2 para radicar una reclamación en el Formulario  941-X (PR) solicitando el reembolso o reducción de la cantidad indicada en la línea 20.       Para asegurar que el IRS tenga el tiempo suficiente para tramitar un crédito por un ajuste hecho por declarar en exceso en el trimestre en el cual radica el Formulario 941-X (PR), se le recomienda radicar en los 2 primeros meses del trimestre un Formulario 941-X (PR) que corrige la cantidad declarada en exceso. Por ejemplo, si descubre una cantidad declarada en exceso en marzo, junio, septiembre o diciembre, quizás quiera radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) en los 2 primeros meses del siguiente trimestre. No obstante, tienen que quedar 90 días en el plazo de prescripción cuando radique el Formulario 941-X (PR).  Vea la Precaución, bajo el tema titulado ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, anteriormente. Esto debería asegurar que el IRS tenga suficiente tiempo para tramitar el Formulario 941-X (PR) de manera que el crédito sea registrado antes de que usted radique el Formulario 941-PR a fin de evitar que el IRS le envíe erróneamente una notificación de saldo adeudado. Lea el ejemplo a continuación.   Ejemplo: Usted quiere que se le aplique la contribución pagada en exceso como crédito en el Formulario 941-PR. El 19 de junio de 2015, descubre que declaró contribuciones en exceso en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014 y quiere optar por el proceso de ajuste. Para permitir que el IRS tenga el tiempo suficiente para tramitar el crédito, radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) el 1 de julio de 2015 y tome el crédito en su Formulario 941-PR para el tercer trimestre de 2015.       Si en la actualidad radica el Formulario 944(SP) en vez del Formulario 941-PR y reclamará un crédito en el Formulario 944(SP), radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) antes de diciembre en cualquier año antes del vencimiento del plazo de prescripción en el Formulario 941-PR. En el año de vencimiento del plazo de prescripción para el Formulario 941-PR, radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) por lo menos 90 días antes de que venza el plazo de prescripción.     Instrucciones Específicas:    Parte 1: Escoja SÓLO un proceso Debido a que el Formulario 941-X (PR) puede ser usado para radicar una planilla de contribución ajustada o una reclamación de reembolso de las contribuciones, usted tiene que marcar una de las casillas en la línea 1 o en la línea 2. No marque ambas casillas.    1. Planilla ajustada de la contribución sobre la nómina Marque la casilla en la línea 1 si está corrigiendo cantidades declaradas de menos o cantidades declaradas en exceso y le gustaría usar el proceso de ajuste para corregir los errores. Si corrige ambas cantidades (las cantidades declaradas de menos y las cantidades declaradas en exceso) en este formulario, tiene que marcar esta casilla. Si marca esta casilla, toda cantidad negativa indicada en la línea 20 se aplicará como crédito (depósito contributivo) en su Formulario 941-PR o Formulario 944(SP) para el período en el cual usted está radicando este formulario. Consulte Ejemplo: Usted quiere que se le aplique la contribución pagada en exceso como crédito en el Formulario 941-PR, anteriormente.  Si adeuda contribuciones.  Pague la cantidad indicada en la línea 20 en el momento en que radica el Formulario 941-X (PR). Por lo general, no se le cobrarán intereses si radica a tiempo, paga a tiempo, anota la fecha en que descubrió los errores y explica las correcciones en la línea 23.    Si tiene un crédito.  Usted declaró contribuciones sobre la nómina en exceso (tiene una cantidad negativa en la línea 20) y quiere que el IRS le aplique el crédito en el Formulario 941-PR o en el Formulario 944(SP) para el período durante el cual usted radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR). El IRS le aplicará el crédito en el primer día del período del Formulario 941-PR o del Formulario 944(SP) en el que radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR). Sin embargo, el crédito que indica en la línea 20 del Formulario 941-X (PR) quizás no esté completamente disponible en su Formulario 941-PR o Formulario 944(SP) si el IRS lo corrige durante la tramitación o si usted adeuda otras contribuciones, multas o intereses. El IRS le notificará si su crédito reclamado cambia o si la cantidad disponible por concepto de crédito en el Formulario 941-PR o Formulario 944(SP) fue reducida debido a contribuciones, multas o intereses no pagados.      No marque la casilla en la línea 1 si está: (a) corrigiendo cantidades declaradas en exceso y el plazo de prescripción para el crédito y reembolso del Formulario 941-PR vencerá dentro de 90 días de la fecha en que radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR), o (b) reclamando un crédito por pagos de asistencia para las primas de COBRA y redujo sus depósitos en anticipación del crédito. En vez de esto, y en ambos casos, marque la casilla en la línea 2 para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) siguiendo el proceso de reclamación. Consulte la sección ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, anteriormente. Además, vea las instrucciones para las líneas  19a  y  19b , más adelante.     2. Reclamación Marque la casilla en la línea 2 para usar el proceso de reclamación si corrige sólo cantidades declaradas en exceso y está reclamando un reembolso o reducción de la cantidad negativa (crédito) indicada en la línea 20. No marque esta casilla si corrige cantidad alguna declarada de menos en este formulario. Tiene que marcar la casilla en la línea 2 si tiene un crédito y el plazo de prescripción para hacer cambios al Formulario 941-PR vence dentro de 90 días de la fecha en que radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR). Consulte la sección ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, anteriormente. El IRS normalmente tramita las reclamaciones poco después de que sean radicadas. El IRS le notificará si su reclamación es denegada, si es aceptada tal como se radicó o si se escoge para ser revisada. Consulte la Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund (Revisión de planillas, sus derechos de apelación y las reclamaciones de reembolso), en inglés, para saber más información sobre este tema. A menos que el IRS corrija el Formulario 941-X (PR) durante la tramitación de dicho formulario o usted adeude otras contribuciones, multas o intereses, el IRS le reembolsará la cantidad indicada en la línea 20 más todos los intereses que le correspondan.     Usted no puede radicar una reclamación de reembolso para corregir la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que en realidad fue retenida de los empleados.     Parte 2: Complete las certificaciones Tiene que completar todas las certificaciones que le corresponden marcando las casillas apropiadas. Si todas sus correcciones conciernen a cantidades declaradas de menos, complete sólo la línea 3; omita las líneas 4 y 5 y siga a la Parte 3. Si sus correcciones conciernen a cantidades declaradas en exceso, usted tiene el deber de asegurar que se protejan los derechos de sus empleados de recuperar las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare pagadas en exceso que usted retuvo. Las certificaciones en las líneas 4 y 5 están dirigidas a los requisitos para:  Pagarles o reintegrarles a sus empleados la recaudación en exceso de la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare u Obtener la autorización de sus empleados para que usted radique una reclamación en nombre de ellos. Vea el  Aviso 2015-15, disponible en inglés, para obtener una orientación sobre autorizaciones.       3. Radicación de los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR o Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR Marque la casilla en la línea 3 para certificar que radicó o radicará los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR o Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR, con el Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico y con la Administración del Seguro Social (SSA, por sus siglas en inglés), tal como se requiera, que indiquen las cantidades correctas de salarios y contribuciones de sus empleados. Consulte las instrucciones para el Formulario 499R-2/W-2PR y las Instrucciones para el Formulario W-3PR para obtener información detallada sobre los requisitos de radicación. Tiene que marcar la casilla en la línea 3 para certificar que ha radicado los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR o Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR aun si sus correcciones en el Formulario 941-X (PR) no cambian las cantidades indicadas en dichos formularios. Por ejemplo, si su única corrección al Formulario 941-PR tiene que ver con ajustes contributivos declarados incorrectamente (consulte las instrucciones para la línea 13, más adelante), marque la casilla en la línea 3 para certificar que ya ha radicado todos los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR y Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR requeridos con el Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico y con la SSA.     4. Certificación de los ajustes hechos por declarar en exceso Si declaró las contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare o la Contribución Adicional al Medicare en exceso y marcó la casilla en la línea 1, marque la casilla correspondiente en la línea 4. Quizás necesite marcar más de una casilla. Si obtuvo declaraciones por escrito de algunos empleados pero no pudo encontrar a sus empleados u obtener declaraciones de los empleados que quedaban, marque todas las casillas que le correspondan. Provea un resumen en la línea 23 de la cantidad de las correcciones de ambos: para los empleados que le dieron declaraciones por escrito y para los empleados que no lo hicieron.  4a.  Marque la casilla en la línea 4a si la cantidad que declaró en exceso incluye la parte correspondiente al empleado afectado de las contribuciones recaudadas en exceso. Está certificando que le devolvió o le reembolsó la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones del año en curso y de años anteriores y que recibió declaraciones por escrito de los empleados que indican que ellos no han recibido, ni recibirán, un reembolso o crédito por las contribuciones correspondientes al año anterior. Está certificando que usted ajustó la Contribución Adicional al Medicare retenida de empleados en el año natural en curso solamente.  No envíe estas declaraciones al IRS. Consérvelas en sus archivos. Por lo general, todos los registros relacionados con las contribuciones sobre la nómina se tienen que conservar al menos 4 años.    4b.  Marque la casilla en la línea 4b para certificar que su cantidad declarada en exceso es sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono de las contribuciones por aquellos empleados a quienes no pudo encontrar o por aquellos que no le dieron a usted una declaración descrita en la línea 4a.    4c.  Marque la casilla en la línea 4c para certificar que la cantidad declarada en exceso es sólo por contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare o por la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que no le retuvo a sus empleados.       5. Certificación de las reclamaciones Si está radicando una reclamación por reembolso o reducción (descuento) de las contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare o de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare y marcó la casilla en la línea 2, marque la casilla correspondiente en la línea 5.

Provea un resumen en la línea 23 de la cantidad de las correcciones para los empleados que le dieron las declaraciones o autorizaciones y para los empleados que no lo hicieron.    Usted no puede radicar una reclamación de reembolso para corregir la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que en realidad fue retenida de los empleados.  5a.  Marque la casilla en la línea 5a si sus contribuciones declaradas en exceso de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare incluyen la parte correspondiente a cada empleado afectado. Usted certifica que le pagó o le reembolsó a los empleados la parte que les corresponde de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Para reembolsos de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare declaradas en exceso de los empleados en años anteriores, usted certifica que recibió declaraciones por escrito de dichos empleados indicando que ellos no han recibido, ni recibirán, un reembolso o crédito por las contribuciones correspondientes al año anterior.    5b.  Marque la casilla en la línea 5b si sus contribuciones declaradas en exceso incluyen la parte correspondiente a cada empleado afectado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare y usted no le ha pagado o reembolsado la parte correspondiente al empleado de dichas contribuciones. Usted certifica que ha recibido la autorización de cada empleado afectado para radicar una reclamación de reembolso por la parte que le corresponde al empleado de dichas contribuciones y recibió declaraciones por escrito de esos empleados que indican que no han recibido, ni recibirán, un reembolso o crédito por las contribuciones correspondientes al año anterior. No envíe estas declaraciones y autorizaciones al IRS. Consérvelas en sus archivos. Por lo general, todos los registros relacionados con las contribuciones sobre la nómina se tienen que conservar al menos 4 años.   En ciertas situaciones, quizás no le haya pagado (devuelto) o reembolsado dichas contribuciones a sus empleados o no haya obtenido su autorización antes de radicar una reclamación, como en casos en que el plazo de prescripción sobre un crédito o reembolso está a punto de vencer. En dichas situaciones, radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) pero no marque una casilla en la línea 5. En la línea 23, declare que no les ha pagado (devuelto) ni reembolsado a los empleados ni ha obtenido sus autorizaciones en el momento en que radica su reclamación. Sin embargo, tiene que pagarle o reembolsarle a sus empleados y certificar dicha acción antes de que el IRS le pueda conceder la reclamación.  5c.  Marque la casilla en la línea 5c para certificar que sus contribuciones declaradas en exceso son sólo por la parte correspondiente al patrono de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Esto corresponde cuando los empleados afectados no le concedieron autorización para radicar una reclamación de reembolso por la parte que le corresponde al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare, o no pudo encontrar a esos empleados, o dichos empleados no le dieron una declaración descrita en la línea 5b.    5d.  Marque la casilla en la línea 5d para certificar que su cantidad declarada en exceso es sólo por contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare o la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que no le retuvo a sus empleados.        Parte 3: Anote las correcciones para este trimestre    ¿Qué cantidades debe declarar en laParte 3? Indique en las columnas 1 y 2 de las líneas 8 a 11 las cantidades para todos sus empleados, no sólo para aquellos empleados cuyas cantidades está corrigiendo. Si la corrección que declara en la columna 4 incluye cantidades declaradas de menos y cantidades declaradas en exceso (consulte las instrucciones para la línea 21, más adelante), provea detalles para cada error en la línea 23. Debido a que circunstancias especiales les corresponden a las líneas 12 a 17 y las líneas 19a y 19b, lea las instrucciones para cada línea con sumo cuidado antes de anotar cantidades en las columnas.    Si previamente ajustó o enmendó el Formulario 941-PR por medio del Formulario 941-X (PR) o debido a un cambio como resultado de una revisión hecha por el IRS, indique cantidades en la columna 2 que incluyan esas correcciones declaradas previamente.     8. Salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social    La tasa para los años 2011 y 2012 de la contribución al Seguro Social que le corresponde al empleado era 4.2%. Si está corrigiendo los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social que declaró en la columna 1 de la línea 5a del Formulario 941-PR, anote la cantidad corregida total en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o la cantidad según se corrigió anteriormente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.           Línea 8 (columna 1)         -Línea 8 (columna 2)          Línea 8 (columna 3)    Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.      Multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .124 (.104 para correcciones de una planilla de 2011 ó 2012) y anote el resultado en la columna 4.          Línea 8 (columna 3)                x .124    (Use .104 para correcciones de una planilla de 2011 ó 2012).     Línea 8 (columna 4)    Si la cantidad en la columna 3 tenía un signo de menos, también use un signo de menos en la columna 4.        Nota: Si corrige sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono de las contribuciones sobre una disminución de salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social, use .062 (6.2%) cuando multiplique la cantidad indicada en la columna 3. Si corrige ambas partes de las contribuciones para algunos empleados y sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono para otros empleados, anote la cantidad calculada en la columna 4. Asegúrese de mostrar sus cálculos en la línea 23.     Ejemplo: Disminución de los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social. Usted declaró $9,000 por concepto del total de salarios, propinas y otra remuneración en el Formulario 941-PR del primer trimestre de 2015. En mayo de 2015, se da cuenta que en dos ocasiones incluyó $2,000 en salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social para el mismo empleado. Para corregir el error, calcule la diferencia en el Formulario 941-X (PR) de la siguiente manera:         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 7,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5a, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  9,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)    -2,000.00        Use la diferencia en la columna 3 para determinar su corrección contributiva:         Columna 3 (diferencia) -2,000.00     Tasa contributiva (12.4%)    × .124      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)     -248.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.     Nota: Si el ejemplo anterior era para una corrección a una planilla de 2011 ó 2012, la cantidad en la columna 3 se multiplicaría por .104.         9. Propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social    La tasa para los años 2011 y 2012 de la contribución al Seguro Social que le corresponde al empleado era 4.2%. Si está corrigiendo las propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social que declaró en la columna 1 de la línea 5b del Formulario 941-PR, anote el total de la cantidad corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que usted declaró originalmente o la cantidad tal como la corrigió anteriormente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 9 (columna 1)       -Línea 9 (columna 2)        Línea 9 (columna 3)  Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.      Multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .124 (use .104 para correcciones de una planilla de 2011 ó 2012) y declare el resultado en la columna 4.          Línea 9 (columna 3)                x .124    (Use .104 para correcciones de una planilla de 2011 ó 2012).     Línea 9 (columna 4)    Si la cantidad en la columna 3 tenía un signo de menos, también use un signo de menos en la columna 4.        Nota: Si está corrigiendo sólo la parte de las contribuciones correspondiente al patrono debido a la disminución en propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social, use .062 (6.2%) cuando multiplica la cantidad indicada en la columna 3. Si está corrigiendo ambas partes de las contribuciones para algunos empleados y sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono para otros empleados, declare la cantidad debidamente calculada en la columna 4. Asegúrese de mostrar sus cálculos en la línea 23.   Ejemplo: Aumento en propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social. Usted declaró $9,000 por concepto del total de salarios, propinas y otra remuneración en el Formulario 941-PR del primer trimestre de 2015. En mayo de 2015, se da cuenta que se le olvidó declarar $1,000 en propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social de uno de sus empleados que trabaja a tiempo parcial. Para corregir el error, calcule la diferencia en el Formulario 941-X (PR) tal como se le indica a continuación:         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 10,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5b, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  9,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)    1,000.00        Use la diferencia en la columna 3 para determinar su corrección contributiva:         Columna 3 (diferencia) 1,000.00     Tasa contributiva (12.4%)    × .124      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)     124.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.    Nota: Si el ejemplo anterior era para una corrección a una planilla de 2011 ó 2012, la cantidad en la columna 3 se multiplicaría por .104.      10. Salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare              Si está corrigiendo los salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare que declaró en la columna 1 de la línea 5c del Formulario 941-PR, anote el total de la cantidad corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o la cantidad tal como la corrigió anteriormente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 10 (columna 1)       -Línea 10 (columna 2)        Línea 10 (columna 3)  Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.      Multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .029 (tasa contributiva de 2.9%) y anote el resultado en la columna 4.          Línea 10 (columna 3)                x .029          Línea 10 (columna 4)    Si la cantidad en la columna 3 tenía un signo de menos, también use un signo de menos en la columna 4.        Nota: Si corrige sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono de las contribuciones en una disminución de los salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare, use .0145 (1.45%) cuando multiplica la cantidad en la columna 3. Si corrige ambas partes de la contribución para algunos empleados y sólo la parte correspondiente al empleado para otros empleados, anote la cantidad debidamente calculada en la columna 4. Asegúrese de explicar los cálculos en la línea 23.   Ejemplo: Disminución de los salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare. Usted declaró $9,000 por concepto del total de salarios, propinas y otra remuneración en el Formulario 941-PR del primer trimestre de 2015. En mayo de 2015, se da cuenta que en dos ocasiones incluyó $2,000 en salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare para el mismo empleado. Para corregir el error, calcule la diferencia en el Formulario 941-X (PR) de la siguiente manera:         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 7,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5c, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  9,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)   -2,000.00        Use la diferencia en la columna 3 para determinar su corrección contributiva:         Columna 3 (diferencia) -2,000.00     Tasa contributiva (2.9%)    × .029      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)     -58.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.      11. Salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al                    Medicare                              Por lo general, puede corregir errores a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare sólo si usted encontró los errores en el mismo año natural en el cual los salarios y propinas fueron pagados a los empleados. Sin embargo, puede corregir errores a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare para años anteriores si la cantidad declarada en la  línea 5d de la columna 2 del Formulario 941-PR no concuerda con la cantidad que en realidad retuvo. Esta clase de error es un error administrativo. También, puede corregir errores a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare para años anteriores si las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 aplican. Si las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 aplican, vea las instrucciones para la línea  17, más adelante. Si un error de un año anterior fue un error no administrativo, puede corregir sólo los salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que declaró originalmente en la  línea 5d de la columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR o corregidos previamente en el Formulario 941-X (PR). No puede corregir la contribución declarada en la  línea 5d de la columna 2 del Formulario 941-PR.  Errores descubiertos en el mismo año natural o errores administrativos de años anteriores.  Si está corrigiendo los salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que declaró en la  línea 5d de la columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR, anote la cantidad total corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o que corrigió previamente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 11 (columna 1)       -Línea 11 (columna 2)        Línea 11 (columna 3)  Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.        Multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%) y anote el resultado en la columna 4.          Línea 11 (columna 3)                x .009          Línea 11 (columna 4)    Si la cantidad en la columna 3 tenía un signo de menos, también use un signo de menos en la columna 4.       Ejemplo: Error administrativo de un año anterior (cantidad declarada incorrectamente de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare realmente retenida). En noviembre de 2014, el salario del Empleado A excedió del límite de $200,000 para la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Para el año 2014, el total de salarios pagados al Empleado A fue $230,000. Usted retuvo $270 ($30,000 x .009) de los salarios del empleado. Sin embargo, en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014, usted declaró erróneamente $3,000 en la línea 5d de la columna 1 y la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare de $27 en la línea 5d de la columna 2. Usted descubrió el error el 16 de marzo de 2015. Esto es un ejemplo de un error administrativo que puede corregir en un año natural más tarde debido a que la cantidad que realmente se retuvo es diferente a la cantidad que declaró en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre del año 2014. Use la línea  11 del Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir el error, como se indica a continuación.         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 30,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5d, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  3,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)   27,000.00        Use la diferencia en la columna 3 para determinar su corrección contributiva.         Columna 3 (diferencia) 27,000.00     Tasa contributiva (0.9%)    × .009      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)   243.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea  23 las razones por las que hizo estas correcciones.   Errores no administrativos de años anteriores.  Usted puede corregir sólo los salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que declaró en la  línea 5d de la columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR. Anote el total de la cantidad corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o que corrigió previamente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 11 (columna 1)       -Línea 11 (columna 2)        Línea 11 (columna 3)  Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.       No multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%). Deje la columna 4 en blanco y explique en la  línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.    Ejemplo: Error no administrativo de un año anterior (incumplimiento del requisito de retener la Contribución Adicional al Medicare). En diciembre de 2014, el salario del Empleado B excedió del límite superior de $200,000 para propósitos de la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Para el año 2014, el total de salarios pagados al Empleado B fue $220,000. Usted estaba obligado a retener $180 ($20,000 x .009), pero no lo retuvo ni tampoco declaró cantidad alguna en la línea 5d de su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014. Descubrió el error el 16 de marzo de 2015. Presente el Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir los salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare para su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014, pero no puede corregir la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare (columna 4) porque el error tiene que ver con un año anterior y la cantidad previamente declarada para el empleado representa la cantidad actual retenida del empleado durante 2014.   Combinación de errores administrativos y errores no administrativos de un año anterior.  Si está declarando ambas clases de errores (administrativos y no administrativos) para el mismo trimestre de un año previo, anote el total de la cantidad corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o que corrigió previamente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2. Sin embargo, multiplique sólo la cantidad de salarios y propinas declarada en la columna 3 que está relacionada con errores administrativos por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%). No multiplique los salarios y propinas declarados en la columna 3 que están relacionados con errores no administrativos por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%). Use la línea  23 para explicar en detalle sus correcciones. La explicación tiene que incluir las razones para las correcciones y un desglose del cálculo sobre la cantidad declarada en la columna 3 y cuáles cantidades están relacionadas con errores administrativos y errores no administrativos.    Ejemplo: Combinación de errores administrativos y errores no administrativos de un año anterior. En noviembre de 2014, el salario del Empleado A excedió del límite superior de $200,000 para propósitos de la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Para el año 2014, el total de salarios pagados al Empleado A fue $230,000. La cantidad que retuvo del salario fue $270 ($30,000 x .009). Sin embargo, usted erróneamente declaró $3,000 en la columna 1 de la línea 5d de su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014, y declaró la cantidad de retención de $27 en la columna 2 de la línea 5d. La diferencia en los salarios sujetos a la Contribución Adicional al Medicare en relación con este error administrativo es $27,000 ($30,000 - $3,000). En diciembre de 2014, el salario del Empleado B excedió del límite superior de $200,000 para la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Para 2014, el total de salarios pagado al Empleado B fue $220,000. Usted estaba obligado a retener $180 ($20,000 x .009) pero no los retuvo ni tampoco declaró los $20,000 de salarios sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare del Empleado B en la línea 5d del Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014. Usted descubrió ambos errores el 16 de marzo de 2015. Use la línea 11 del Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir los errores, como se indica a continuación.         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 50,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5d, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  3,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)   47,000.00        Determine la parte de los salarios y propinas declarada en la columna 3 que está relacionada con el error administrativo ($47,000 - $20,000 (error no administrativo) = $27,000 (error administrativo)). Multiplique esta parte de la columna 3 por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%) para determinar su corrección contributiva:         Diferencia relacionada con el error administrativo 27,000.00     Tasa contributiva (0.9%)    × .009      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)   243.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea  23 las razones por las que hizo estas correcciones. Además, tiene que informar que $20,000 de la cantidad indicada en la columna 3 está relacionada con la corrección de un error no administrativo de un año anterior y $27,000 de la cantidad indicada en la columna 3 está relacionada con la corrección de un error administrativo.      12. Notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q): Contribución adeudada por propinas no declaradas Anote toda corrección, incluyendo cantidades declaradas en la  línea 5e (para trimestres que terminaron en 2011 ó 2012) del Formulario 941-PR y cantidades declaradas en la  línea 5f (para trimestres que terminaron después de 2012) del Formulario 941-PR de la contribución adeudada que aparece en la Notice and Demand under Section 3121(q) (Notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q)), en inglés, en la  línea 12. El IRS emite esta notificación para informarle a un patrono de la cantidad de propinas recibidas por empleados que no fueron declaradas al IRS o propinas que no fueron declaradas al patrono. El patrono no es responsable de pagar la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare por las propinas no declaradas hasta que el IRS le emite una notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q) al patrono.     13. Ajustes a la contribución Use la línea 13 para corregir todo ajuste indicado en las líneas 7 a 9 del Formulario 941-PR. Anote en la columna 1 el total de las cantidades corregidas en las líneas 7 a 9 del Formulario 941-PR. Anote en la columna 2 el total de las cantidades declaradas originalmente o cantidades ajustadas previamente de las líneas 7 a 9 del Formulario 941-PR. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 13 (columna 1)       -Línea 13 (columna 2)        Línea 13 (columna 3)              Quizás necesite declarar cifras negativas en una columna. Asegúrese que la diferencia que anote en la columna 3 represente con exactitud los cambios a los ajustes que fueron declarados originalmente o corregidos previamente en las líneas 7 a 9 del Formulario 941-PR. Copie la cantidad de la columna 3 en la columna 4. Incluya todo signo de menos que aparezca en la columna 3. En la línea 23, describa lo que usted declaró erróneamente en el Formulario 941-PR. Indique si su ajuste es por fracciones de centavos, compensación por enfermedad pagada por terceros, propinas o seguro temporal de vida colectivo a término fijo.  Ejemplo: Declaración de menos de la compensación por enfermedad pagada por terceros en el trimestre en curso. Usted declaró $6,900 (que se indica como \"-6,900.00\") por concepto de un ajuste de la compensación por enfermedad pagada por terceros (reducción a la contribución) en la línea 8 de su Formulario 941-PR del segundo trimestre de 2014. No declaró ninguna cantidad en las líneas 7 ni 9. Su ajuste de la compensación por enfermedad pagada por terceros debió ser $9,600 (que se indica como \"-9,600.00\") porque su tercero pagador de la compensación por enfermedad retuvo dicha cantidad por concepto de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare de sus empleados. Usted descubrió el error en abril de 2015. Para corregir el error, calcule la diferencia en el Formulario 941-X (PR) como se indica a continuación:         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) -9,600.00     Columna 2 (línea 8 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  (6,900.00)      Columna 3 (diferencia)    -2,700.00        Usted anotaría las cifras en el Formulario 941-X (PR) de la siguiente manera:          Columna 1 Columna 2 (línea 8  Columna 3   (cantidad corregida) del Formulario 941-PR) (diferencia)    -9,600.00 -6,900.00 -2,700.00      Declare \"-2,700.00\" como su corrección en la columna 4. En este ejemplo, usted reclama un crédito de $2,700 por concepto de contribuciones declaradas en exceso para su Formulario 941-PR del segundo trimestre de 2014. Anote siempre la misma cantidad en la columna 4 (incluyendo todo signo de menos) que usted anota en la columna 3.  Asegúrese de explicar en la línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.     15-17. Aportaciones especiales a los salarios para las contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare y la Contribución Adicional al                    Medicare                              En ciertas circunstancias, la sección 3509 establece tasas especiales para la parte correspondiente al empleado de la contribución al Seguro Social, de la contribución al Medicare y de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare cuando los trabajadores son reclasificados como empleados. La tasa correspondiente dependerá de si usted radicó las planillas informativas que se requieren. Un patrono no puede recuperar ninguna contribución pagada bajo esta disposición de los empleados. La parte completa del patrono de la contribución al Seguro Social y de la contribución al Medicare tiene que pagarse en toda situación de reclasificación.   Nota: Las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 no están disponibles si usted intencionalmente hizo caso omiso de los requisitos de la retención de contribuciones a los empleados. Las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 tampoco están disponibles para ciertos empleados estatutarios.  Los contribuyentes en Puerto Rico no deben completar la línea 14. En las líneas 15 a 17, anote sólo las correcciones hechas a salarios que son el resultado de la reclasificación de ciertos trabajadores como empleados cuando las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 se usan para calcular las contribuciones. Si el patrono radicó las planillas informativas que se requieren, use las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 de la siguiente manera:  Para las contribuciones al Seguro Social, use la tasa que le corresponde al patrono de 6.2% más el 20% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 6.2% (4.2% para los años 2011 y 2012), para una tasa total de 7.44% (7.04% para los años 2011 y 2012) de los salarios. Para las contribuciones al Medicare, use la tasa que le corresponde al patrono de 1.45% más el 20% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 1.45%, para una tasa total de 1.74% de los salarios. Para la Contribución Adicional al Medicare, el 0.18% (20% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 0.9%) de los salarios sujetos a la Contribución Adicional al Medicare.    Si el patrono no radicó las planillas informativas que se requieren, use las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 de la siguiente manera:  Para las contribuciones al Seguro Social, use la tasa que le corresponde al patrono de 6.2% más el 40% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 6.2% (4.2% para los años 2011 y 2012), para una tasa total de 8.68% (7.88% para los años 2011 y 2012) de los salarios. Para las contribuciones al Medicare, use la tasa que le corresponde al patrono de 1.45% más el 40% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 1.45%, para una tasa total de 2.03% de los salarios. Para la Contribucion Adicional al Medicare, el 0.36% (40% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 0.9%) de los salarios sujetos a la Contribución Adicional al Medicare.    A diferencia de otras líneas en el Formulario 941-X (PR), anote en la columna 1 sólo los salarios corregidos relacionados con la reclasificación de trabajadores, no la cantidad pagada a TODOS los empleados. Anote la cantidad de salarios declarados correspondiente a los empleados reclasificados (si existe) en la columna 2. Para obtener la cantidad para la columna 4, use las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 que le correspondan. Si usted radicó las planillas informativas para algunos empleados, pero no lo hizo para otros, asegúrese de usar las tasas aplicables para cada empleado al calcular las cantidades en la columna 4 y mostrar sus cálculos en la  línea 23. La corrección contributiva en la columna 4 será una cifra positiva si aumentó la cantidad de salarios que había declarado anteriormente. Consulte las instrucciones para la línea 22, más adelante, para obtener más información.     18. Subtotal Combine las cantidades de la columna 4 de las líneas 8 a 17.  Ejemplo. Usted anotó \"1,400.00\" en la columna 4 de la línea 8; \"-500.00\" en la columna 4 de la línea 9; y \"-100.00\" en la columna 4 de la línea 10. Combine las cantidades y anote \"800.00\" en la columna 4 de la línea 18.         Línea 8  1,400.00     Línea 9  -500.00     Línea 10   -100.00      Línea 18  800.00             19a. Reclamación o corrección del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA                 El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA estuvo disponible a los patronos por las primas pagadas en nombre de empleados que fueron cesados involuntariamente de sus empleos entre el 1 de septiembre de 2008 y el 31 de mayo de 2010. El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA no está disponible para las personas que fueron cesadas involuntariamente después del 31 de mayo de 2010. Por lo tanto, sólo en ciertas circunstancias, el crédito estará disponible, como en casos en donde la elegibilidad a COBRA fue demorada como resultado de cobertura de seguro de salud provista por el patrono después del cese. Anote el 65% del total de pagos de asistencia para las primas de COBRA para todos los individuos que cumplen con los requisitos para la asistencia en la columna 1. Declare los pagos de asistencia para las primas en esta línea sólo después de que el 35% de la parte que le corresponde a los individuos que cumplen con los requisitos haya sido pagada. Para la cobertura de COBRA provista conforme a un plan de autoasegurados, la asistencia para las primas de COBRA es tratada como si hubiera sido hecha para cada individuo que cumple los requisitos para dicha asistencia que pagó el 35% de la prima. No incluya en esta línea el 35% de la prima que le corresponde al individuo que cumple los requisitos en la cantidad anotada en esta línea. Para los períodos contributivos que terminan antes del 1 de enero de 2014, anote en la columna 2 todo pago de asistencia para las primas de COBRA que fue reclamado previamente en la  línea 12a del Formulario 941-PR. Para los períodos contributivos que comienzan después del 31 de diciembre de 2013, anote \"-0-\" en la columna 2, a menos que esté corrigiendo un pago de asistencia para las primas de COBRA que declaró previamente en el Formulario 941-X (PR). Si usted o si el IRS corrigió previamente la cantidad declarada, la cantidad anotada en la columna 2 deberá incluir todas las correcciones que se hicieron previamente. Anote la diferencia entre la columna 1 y la columna 2 en la columna 3. Copie la cantidad de la columna 3 en la columna 4. No obstante, para mostrar debidamente la cantidad como partida de crédito o saldo adeudado, anote una cifra positiva de la columna 3 como cifra negativa en la columna 4; una cifra negativa de la columna 3 como cifra positiva en la columna 4.    El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA se trata como un crédito en el primer día del período de su planilla (es decir, 1 de enero, 1 de abril, 1 de julio o el 1 de octubre). Sin embargo, debido a que el crédito ahora se reclama en el Formulario 941-X (PR) que se radica DESPUÉS de que se radique el Formulario 941-PR, un patrono que reduce sus depósitos requeridos en anticipación del crédito recibirá una notificación generada por el sistema reflejando un saldo además de multas e intereses correspondientes. El saldo adeudado como resultado de la reducción de los depósitos en anticipación del crédito, incluyendo toda multa e intereses correspondientes, se eliminará cuando se le aplique el crédito. Por lo general, tal eliminación ocurrirá sin requerir ninguna otra acción de parte del patrono. Como alternativa para evitar que se emita una notificación generada por el sistema con un saldo adeudado, el patrono puede efectuar sus depósitos sin aplicar la reducción en anticipación del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA y seguir estas instrucciones para reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA. Si desea más información sobre el subsidio de primas de COBRA, visite IRS.gov e ingrese                    \"COBRA\"                 en la casilla Search (Buscar), en inglés.     19b. Número de individuos que recibieron asistencia para las primas de COBRA declaradas en la línea 19a Anote en la columna 1 el número total de individuos que cumplen los requisitos para la asistencia para las primas de COBRA y que se les ha provisto dicha asistencia. Cuente a cada individuo que cumple los requisitos para dicha asistencia que pagó una prima reducida de COBRA para el trimestre como un individuo, sin tomar en cuenta si la prima reducida sea o no para seguro que cubrió a más de un individuo que cumple los requisitos de asistencia. Por ejemplo, si la prima reducida de COBRA fue para la cobertura de un ex empleado, su cónyuge y dos hijos, usted incluiría a un individuo en el número anotado en la línea 19b para la asistencia de las primas anotada en la línea 19a. Además, cada individuo es declarado sólo una vez por trimestre. Por ejemplo, un individuo que cumple los requisitos de la asistencia y que hizo pagos de prima mensuales durante el trimestre sería declarado como sólo un individuo en la línea 19b para ese trimestre. Para los períodos contributivos que terminan antes del 1 de enero de 2014, anote en la columna 2 la cantidad de individuos que cumplen los requisitos para la asistencia para las primas de COBRA declaradas previamente en la  línea 12b del Formulario 941-PR. Para los períodos contributivos que comienzan después del 31 de diciembre de 2013, anote \"-0-\" en la columna 2 a menos que esté corrigiendo un Formulario 941-X (PR) radicado previamente. Si usted o si el IRS corrigió previamente la cantidad de individuos declarados, la cantidad que anote en la columna 2 debe tomar en cuenta todas las correcciones previas.     20. Total  Combine las cantidades de la columna 4 de las líneas 18 y 19a y anote el resultado en la línea 20.  Su crédito.  Si la cantidad que anotó en la línea 20 es menos de cero, por ejemplo, \"-115.00\", usted tiene un crédito porque declaró en exceso sus contribuciones federales sobre la nómina.  Si marcó la casilla en la línea 1, incluya esta cantidad en la línea 11 (línea \"Total de depósitos...\") del Formulario 941-PR correspondiente al trimestre durante el cual radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR) o en la línea 8 (línea \"Total de depósitos...\") del Formulario 944(SP) para el año en el cual radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR). No haga ningún cambio a su registro de obligación contributiva federal declarada en la línea 14 del Formulario 941-PR o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) si su Formulario 941-X (PR) es radicado a tiempo. Las cantidades declaradas en el registro deben reflejar su verdadera obligación contributiva para el período. Si marcó la casilla de la línea 2, usted está radicando una reclamación de reembolso o reducción por la cantidad que se indica.    Si su crédito es menos de $1, le enviaremos un reembolso o se lo aplicaremos como crédito sólo si lo solicita por escrito.    Cantidad que adeuda.  Si la cantidad en la línea 20 es una cifra positiva, tiene que pagar la cantidad que adeuda en el momento en que radique el Formulario 941-X (PR). No puede usar ningún crédito que indique en otro Formulario 941-X (PR) para pagar la cantidad adeudada, aun si radicó a causa de la cantidad adeudada y por el crédito a la misma vez. Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) a tiempo, no radique un Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) enmendado, a menos que se le haya impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) debido a un Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) que falta, que está incorrecto o que está incompleto. No incluya la cantidad de aumento en la contribución declarada en el Formulario 941-X (PR) en ningún Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) enmendado que usted radique. Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) tarde, eso es, después de la fecha de vencimiento del Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre en el que usted descubrió el error, tiene que radicar un Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) enmendado con el Formulario 941-X (PR). De otro modo, el IRS podría imponerle (gravarle) una multa \"promediada\" por no depositar. El total de obligación contributiva declarada en la línea \"                      Obligación total para el trimestre                   \" del Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) tiene que ser igual a la cantidad total de contribuciones (línea 10 del Formulario 941-PR combinado con cualquier corrección declarada en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.    Métodos de pago. Puede pagar la cantidad que adeuda en la línea 20 por medios electrónicos usando el sistema electrónico de pagos de la contribución federal (EFTPS, por sus siglas en inglés), con tarjeta de crédito o débito, o con cheque o giro.  El método preferido es el EFTPS. Para obtener más información, visite el sitio web www.eftps.gov, en inglés, llame al Servicio al Cliente del EFTPS al 1-800-244-4829 (o al 1-800-733-4839, si es usuario de equipo TDD) para recibir ayuda en español o vea la Pub. 966 (SP), Sistema de Pago Electrónico del Impuesto Federal: La Manera Segura de Pagar los Impuestos Federales. Para pagar con tarjeta de crédito o débito, visite el sitio web del IRS  www.irs.gov/pagos. Si paga mediante un cheque o giro, hágalo a la orden del                                   \"United States Treasury\"                                (Tesoro de los EE.UU.). Anote su EIN, \"Formulario 941-X (PR)\", el trimestre natural que está corrigiendo (por ejemplo, \"2do Trimestre\") y el año natural del trimestre que está corrigiendo.     No tiene que pagar si el saldo que adeuda es menos de $1.      Multa por no depositar que se le impuso anteriormente. Si la línea 20 refleja contribuciones declaradas en exceso y el IRS le impuso (gravó) una multa FTD anteriormente, quizás pueda reducir la cantidad de la multa. Para más información, consulte las Instrucciones para el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR).       Parte 4: Explique sus correcciones para este trimestre     21. Correcciones de las cantidades declaradas de menos y las cantidades declaradas en exceso Marque la casilla en la línea 21 si cualquier corrección que anotó en la columna 3 de las líneas 8 a 19a refleja cantidades declaradas de menos y cantidades declaradas en exceso.  Ejemplo. Si tuvo un aumento de los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social de $15,000 para el Empleado A y una reducción de los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social de $5,000 para el Empleado B, usted anotaría $10,000 en la columna 3 de la línea 8. Esos $10,000 representan el cambio neto a causa de la corrección. En la línea 23, tiene que dar las razones que explican el aumento de $15,000 y también la reducción de $5,000.      22. ¿Reclasificó a sus trabajadores? Marque la casilla en la línea 22 si reclasificó a algún empleado como contratista independiente o como \"trabajador que no es empleado\" (trabajador que no está en nómina). También marque esta casilla si el IRS (o usted) determinó que los trabajadores que usted trató como contratistas independientes o trabajadores que no son empleados deberían estar clasificados como empleados. En la línea 23 provea una razón detallada que explique por qué reclasificó a un trabajador y, si usó tasas conforme a la sección 3509 en las líneas 15 a 17 para un trabajador que fue reclasificado como empleado, explique por qué le corresponden las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 y cuáles tasas usó.  Planilla que no se radicó debido a que no trató como empleado a ningún trabajador.  Si no ha radicado anteriormente un Formulario 941-PR porque trató incorrectamente a todos los trabajadores como si fueran contratistas independientes o trabajadores que no eran empleados, radique un Formulario 941-PR para cada trimestre atrasado. En cada Formulario 941-PR por el cual tiene derecho a usar tasas conforme a la sección 3509 complete los siguientes pasos.  Anote                                \"                                  Misclassified Employees                               \"                             (Empleados clasificados erróneamente) en letra negrilla en la parte superior de la página 1. Anote cero en la línea 10 (\"Total de contribuciones después de considerar los ajustes\"). Complete la sección donde se firma. Adjunte un Formulario 941-X (PR) debidamente completado (vea las instrucciones a continuación).    En cada Formulario 941-X (PR) complete los siguientes pasos.

Anote cero en la columna 2 de las líneas 15 a 17. Complete las columnas 3 y 4 tal como se le indica en la Parte 3. Provea una explicación detallada en la línea 23. Complete la sección donde se firma.         Si no puede usar las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 (por ejemplo, debido a que los trabajadores que usted trató como trabajadores que no son empleados eran, de hecho, empleados estatutarios determinados), radique un Formulario 941-PR por cada trimestre atrasado. Anote \"                   Misclassified Employees                \" (Empleados clasificados erróneamente) en letra negrilla en la parte superior de la página 1 de cada Formulario 941-PR. Complete el Formulario 941-PR consultando las Instrucciones para el Formulario 941-PR. Adjunte el Formulario 941-X (PR) a cada Formulario 941-PR. Complete la parte superior del Formulario 941-X (PR), incluyendo la fecha en que descubrió el error y provea una explicación detallada en la línea 23.     23. Explique sus correcciones Los reglamentos del Tesoro requieren que usted explique en detalle los fundamentos y hechos en los cuales se basa cada corrección. En la línea 23, describa en detalle cada corrección que anotó en la columna 4 en las líneas 8 a 17 y 19a. Además, use la línea 23 para describir las correcciones hechas en la línea 19b. Si necesita más espacio, adjunte hojas adicionales y anote su nombre, EIN, \"Formulario 941-X (PR)\", el trimestre que está corrigiendo (por ejemplo, \"2do Trimestre\") y el año natural del trimestre que está corrigiendo en la parte superior de cada hoja. Usted tiene que describir los hechos que causaron que declarara salarios de menos o en exceso. El dar explicaciones tales como \"salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare fueron sobrestimados\" o \"se descubrieron errores administrativos o de nómina\" no es suficiente y puede causar demoras al tramitar su Formulario 941-X (PR) ya que el IRS puede pedirle una explicación más completa. Provea la siguiente información en la explicación para cada error que corrige:  Los números de las líneas en el Formulario 941-X (PR) afectados. La fecha en que descubrió el error. La diferencia (cantidad del error). La causa del error.  Usted puede declarar la información en un párrafo. El párrafo a continuación es un ejemplo:                 \"La diferencia de $1,000 que aparece en la columna 3 de las líneas 8 y 10 fue descubierta durante una revisión interna de la nómina el 15 de mayo de 2015. Descubrimos que $1,000 en salarios de un empleado fueron incluidos dos veces. Esta corrección elimina los salarios declarados que nunca fueron pagados\".

See Schedule G, Part I, line 5, and the Instructions for Form 8960.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIncome Taxation of Trusts and Decedents\\' Estates\\nA trust or a decedent\\'s estate is a separate legal entity for federal tax purposes. A decedent\\'s estate comes into existence at the time of death of an individual. A trust may be created during an individual\\'s life (inter vivos)  or at the time of his or her death under a will (testamentary).  If the trust instrument contains certain provisions, then the person creating the trust (the grantor) is treated as the owner of the trust\\'s assets. Such a trust is a grantor type trust. See Grantor Type Trusts, later, under Special Reporting Instructions.  \\nA trust or decedent\\'s estate figures its gross income in much the same manner as an individual. Most deductions and credits allowed to individuals are also allowed to estates and trusts. However, there is one major distinction. A trust or decedent\\'s estate is allowed an income distribution deduction  for distributions to beneficiaries. To figure this deduction, the fiduciary must complete Schedule B. The income distribution deduction determines the amount of any distributions taxed to the beneficiaries.\\nFor this reason, a trust or decedent\\'s estate sometimes is referred to as a \"pass-through\" entity. The beneficiary, and not the trust or decedent\\'s estate, pays income tax on his or her distributive share of income. Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) is used to notify the beneficiaries of the amounts to be included on their income tax returns.\\nBefore preparing Form 1041, the fiduciary must figure the accounting income  of the estate or trust under the will or trust instrument and applicable local law to determine the amount, if any, of income that is required to be distributed, because the income distribution deduction is based, in part, on that amount.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAbusive Trust Arrangements\\nCertain trust arrangements claim to reduce or eliminate federal taxes in ways that are not permitted under the law. Abusive trust arrangements typically are promoted by the promise of tax benefits with no meaningful change in the taxpayer\\'s control over or benefit from the taxpayer\\'s income or assets. The promised benefits may include reduction or elimination of income subject to tax; deductions for personal expenses paid by the trust; depreciation deductions of an owner\\'s personal residence and furnishings; a stepped-up basis for property transferred to the trust; the reduction or elimination of self-employment taxes; and the reduction or elimination of gift and estate taxes. These promised benefits are inconsistent with the tax rules applicable to trust arrangements.\\nAbusive trust arrangements often use trusts to hide the true ownership of assets and income or to disguise the substance of transactions. These arrangements frequently involve more than one trust, each holding different assets of the taxpayer (for example, the taxpayer\\'s business, business equipment, home, automobile, etc.). Some trusts may hold interests in other trusts, purport to involve charities, or are foreign trusts. Funds may flow from one trust to another trust by way of rental agreements, fees for services, purchase agreements, and distributions.\\nSome of the abusive trust arrangements that have been identified include unincorporated business trusts (or organizations), equipment or service trusts, family residence trusts, charitable trusts, and final trusts. In each of these trusts, the original owner of the assets nominally subject to the trust effectively retains the authority to cause financial benefits of the trust to be directly or indirectly returned or made available to the owner. For example, the trustee may be the promoter, a relative, or a friend of the owner who simply carries out the directions of the owner whether or not permitted by the terms of the trust.\\nWhen trusts are used for legitimate business, family, or estate planning purposes, either the trust, the beneficiary, or the transferor of assets to the trust will pay the tax on income generated by the trust property. Trusts can\\'t be used to transform a taxpayer\\'s personal, living, or educational expenses into deductible items, and can\\'t seek to avoid tax liability by ignoring either the true ownership of income and assets or the true substance of transactions. Therefore, the tax results promised by the promoters of abusive trust arrangements are not allowable under the law, and the participants in and promoters of these arrangements may be subject to civil or criminal penalties in appropriate cases.\\nFor more details, including the legal principles that control the proper tax treatment of these abusive trust arrangements, see Notice 97-24, 1997-1 C.B. 409.\\nFor additional information about abusive tax arrangements, visit the IRS website at IRS.gov and type \"Abusive Trusts\" in the search box.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDefinitions\\n\\nAdjusted gross income (AGI).\\nCompute the AGI of an estate or non-grantor trust by subtracting the following from total income on line 9 of page 1:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe administration costs of the estate or trust (the total of lines 12, 14, and 15a to the extent they are costs incurred in the administration of the estate or trust) that wouldn\\'t have been incurred if the property were not held by the estate or trust;\\n\\n\\nThe income distribution deduction (line 18);\\n\\n\\nThe amount of the exemption (line 21);\\n\\n\\nThe net operating loss deduction (NOLD) claimed on line 15b.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nElecting small business trust (ESBT).\\nCompute the AGI of the S portion of an ESBT in the same manner as an individual taxpayer, except that administration costs allocable to the S portion (to the extent they are costs incurred in the administration of the trust that wouldn\\'t have been incurred if the property were not held by the estate or trust) shall be deducted in arriving at AGI. \\n\\n\\n\\nBeneficiary.\\n\\nA beneficiary includes an heir, a legatee, or a devisee.\\n\\n\\nDecedent\\'s estate.\\n\\nThe decedent\\'s estate is an entity that is formed at the time of an individual\\'s death and generally is charged with gathering the decedent\\'s assets, paying the decedent\\'s debts and expenses, and distributing the remaining assets. Generally, the estate consists of all the property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated, that the decedent owned an interest in at death.\\n\\n\\nDistributable net income (DNI).\\n\\nThe income distribution deduction allowable to estates and trusts for amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed to beneficiaries is limited to DNI. This amount, which is figured on Schedule B, line 7, is also used to determine how much of an amount paid, credited, or required to be distributed to a beneficiary will be includible in his or her gross income.\\n\\n\\nIncome in respect of a decedent.\\nWhen completing Form 1041, you must take into account any items that are income in respect of a decedent (IRD).\\nIn general, IRD is income that a decedent was entitled to receive but that was not properly includible in the decedent\\'s final income tax return under the decedent\\'s method of accounting.\\nIRD includes: \\n\\n\\n\\nAll accrued income of a decedent who reported his or her income on the cash method of accounting,\\n\\n\\nIncome accrued solely because of the decedent\\'s death in the case of a decedent who reported his or her income on the accrual method of accounting, and\\n\\n\\nIncome to which the decedent had a contingent claim at the time of his or her death.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSome examples of IRD for a decedent who kept his or her books on the cash method are: \\n\\n\\n\\nDeferred salary payments that are payable to the decedent\\'s estate,\\n\\n\\nUncollected interest on U.S. savings bonds,\\n\\n\\nProceeds from the completed sale of farm produce, and\\n\\n\\nThe portion of a lump-sum distribution to the beneficiary of a decedent\\'s IRA that equals the balance in the IRA at the time of the owner\\'s death. This includes unrealized appreciation and income accrued to that date, less the aggregate amount of the owner\\'s nondeductible contributions to the IRA. Such amounts are included in the beneficiary\\'s gross income in the tax year that the distribution is received.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe IRD has the same character it would have had if the decedent had lived and received such amount.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDeductions and credits in respect of a decedent.\\nThe following deductions and credits, when paid by the decedent\\'s estate, are allowed on Form 1041 even though they were not allowable on the decedent\\'s final income tax return. \\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness expenses deductible under section 162.\\n\\n\\nInterest deductible under section 163.\\n\\n\\nTaxes deductible under section 164.\\n\\n\\nPercentage depletion allowed under section 611.\\n\\n\\nForeign tax credit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information on IRD, see section 691 andPub. 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators.\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome required to be distributed currently.\\nIncome required to be distributed currently is income that is required under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law to be distributed in the year it is received. The fiduciary  must be under a duty to distribute the income currently, even if the actual distribution is not made until after the close of the trust\\'s tax year. See Regulations section 1.651(a)-2.\\n\\n\\nFiduciary.\\n\\nA fiduciary is a trustee of a trust, or an executor, executrix, administrator, administratrix, personal representative, or person in possession of property of a decedent\\'s estate.\\n\\n\\nNote.\\nAny reference in these instructions to \"you\" means the fiduciary of the estate or trust.\\n\\n\\nTrust.\\n\\nA trust is an arrangement created either by a will or by an inter vivos declaration by which trustees take title to property for the purpose of protecting or conserving it for the beneficiaries under the ordinary rules applied in chancery or probate courts.   \\n\\n\\nRevocable living trust.\\n A revocable living trust is an arrangement created by a written agreement or declaration during the life of an individual and can be changed or ended at any time during the individual\\'s life. A revocable living trust is generally created to manage and distribute property. Many people use this type of trust instead of (or in addition to) a will.\\nBecause this type of trust is revocable, it is treated as a grantor type trust for tax purposes. See Grantor Type Trusts under Special Reporting Instructions, later, for special filing instructions that apply to grantor trusts. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBe sure to read Optional Filing Methods for Certain Grantor Type Trusts. Generally, most people that have revocable living trusts will be able to use Optional Method 1. This method is the easiest and least burdensome way to meet your obligations.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must File\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDecedent\\'s Estate\\n\\nThe fiduciary (or one of the joint fiduciaries) must file Form 1041 for a domestic estate that has:\\n\\n\\n\\nGross income for the tax year of $600 or more, or\\n\\n\\nA beneficiary who is a nonresident alien.\\n\\n\\nIf you held a qualified investment in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) at any time during the year, you must file your return with Form 8997 attached. See the Form 8997 instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAn estate is a domestic estate if it isn\\'t a foreign estate. A foreign estate is one the income of which is from sources outside the United States that isn\\'t effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and isn\\'t includible in gross income. If you are the fiduciary of a foreign estate, file Form 1040NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return, instead of Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTrust\\n\\nThe fiduciary (or one of the joint fiduciaries) must file Form 1041 for a domestic trust taxable under section 641 that has:\\n\\n\\n\\nAny taxable income for the tax year,\\n\\n\\nGross income of $600 or more (regardless of taxable income), or\\n\\n\\nA beneficiary who is a nonresident alien.\\n\\n\\nIf you held a qualified investment in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) at any time during the year, you must file your return with Form 8997 attached. See the Form 8997 instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTwo or more trusts are treated as one trust if the trusts have substantially the same grantor(s) and substantially the same primary beneficiary(ies) and a principal purpose of such trusts is avoidance of tax. This provision applies only to that portion of the trust that is attributable to contributions to corpus made after March 1, 1984.\\nA trust is a domestic trust if:\\n\\n\\n\\nA U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust (court test), and\\n\\n\\nOne or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust (control test).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSee Regulations section 301.7701-7 for more information on the court and control tests.\\nAlso treated as a domestic trust is a trust (other than a trust treated as wholly owned by the grantor) that:\\n\\n\\n\\nWas in existence on August 20, 1996,\\n\\n\\nWas treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, and\\n\\n\\nElected to continue to be treated as a domestic trust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA trust that isn\\'t a domestic trust is treated as a foreign trust. If you are the trustee of a foreign trust, file Form 1040NR instead of Form 1041. Also, a foreign trust with a U.S. owner generally must file Form 3520-A, Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a U.S. Owner.\\nIf a domestic trust becomes a foreign trust, it is treated under section 684 as having transferred all of its assets to a foreign trust, except to the extent a grantor or another person is treated as the owner of the trust when the trust becomes a foreign trust.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGrantor Type Trusts\\n\\nIf all or any portion of a trust is a grantor type trust, then that trust or portion of a trust must follow the special reporting requirements discussed later, under Special Reporting Instructions. See Grantor Type Trust under Specific Instructions for more details on what makes a trust a grantor type trust.\\n\\nNote.\\nA trust may be part grantor trust and part \"other\" type of trust, for example, simple or complex, or electing small business trust (ESBT).\\n\\n\\nQualified subchapter S trusts (QSSTs).\\n\\nQSSTs must follow the special reporting requirements for these trusts discussed later, under Special Reporting Instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Rule for Certain Revocable Trusts\\n\\n\\n\\n  Section 645 provides that if both the executor (if any) of an estate (the related estate) and the trustee of a qualified revocable trust (QRT) elect the treatment in section 645, the trust must be treated and taxed as part of the related estate during the election period. This election may be made by a QRT even if no executor is appointed for the related estate.\\nIn general, Form 8855, Election To Treat a Qualified Revocable Trust as Part of an Estate, must be filed by the due date for Form 1041 for the first tax year of the related estate. This applies even if the combined related estate and electing trust don\\'t have sufficient income to be required to file Form 1041. However, if the estate is granted an extension of time to file Form 1041 for its first tax year, the due date for Form 8855 is the extended due date.\\nOnce made, the election is irrevocable.\\n\\nQualified revocable trusts (QRT).\\n\\nIn general, a QRT is any trust (or part of a trust) that, on the day the decedent died, was treated as owned by the decedent because the decedent held the power to revoke the trust as described in section 676. An electing trust is a QRT for which a section 645 election has been made.\\n\\n\\nElection period.\\nThe election period is the period of time during which an electing trust is treated as part of its related estate.\\nThe election period begins on the date of the decedent\\'s death and terminates on the earlier of: \\n\\n\\n\\nThe day on which the electing trust and related estate, if any, distribute all of their assets, or\\n\\n\\nThe day before the applicable date.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo determine the applicable date, first determine whether a Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, is required to be filed as a result of the decedent\\'s death. If no Form 706 is required to be filed, the applicable date is 2 years after the date of the decedent\\'s death. If Form 706 is required, the applicable date is the later of 2 years after the date of the decedent\\'s death or 6 months after the final determination of liability for estate tax. For additional information, see Regulations section 1.645-1(f).\\n\\n\\nTaxpayer identification number (TIN).\\nAll QRTs must obtain a new TIN following the death of the decedent whether or not a section 645 election is made. (Use Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, to notify payers of the new TIN.)\\nAn electing trust that continues after the termination of the election period doesn\\'t need to obtain a new TIN following the termination unless: \\n\\n\\n\\nAn executor was appointed and agreed to the election after the electing trust made a valid section 645 election, and the electing trust filed a return as an estate under the trust\\'s TIN, or\\n\\n\\nNo executor was appointed and the QRT was the filing trust (as explained later).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA related estate that continues after the termination of the election period doesn\\'t need to obtain a new TIN.\\nFor more information about TINs, including trusts with multiple owners, see Regulations sections 1.645-1 and 301.6109-1(a).\\n\\n\\nGeneral procedures for completing Form 1041 during the election period.\\n\\xa0\\nIf there is an executor.  The following rules apply to filing Form 1041 while the election is in effect. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe executor of the related estate is responsible for filing Form 1041 for the estate and all electing trusts. The return is filed under the name and TIN of the related estate. Be sure to check the Decedent\\'s estate box at the top of Form 1041 and Item G if the estate has made a section 645 election. The executor continues to file Form 1041 during the election period even if the estate distributes all of its assets before the end of the election period.\\n\\n\\nThe Form 1041 includes all items of income, deduction, and credit for the estate and all electing trusts.\\n\\n\\nFor Item G, the executor must provide the TIN of the electing trust with the highest total asset value.\\n\\n\\nThe executor must attach a statement to Form 1041 providing the following information for each electing trust (including the electing trust provided in Item G): (a) the name of the electing trust, (b) the TIN of the electing trust, and (c) the name and address of the trustee of the electing trust.\\n\\n\\nThe related estate and the electing trust are treated as separate shares for purposes of computing DNI and applying distribution provisions. Also, each of those shares can contain two or more separate shares. For more information, see Separate share rule, later, and Regulations section 1.645-1(e)(2)(iii).\\n\\n\\nThe executor is responsible for insuring that the estate\\'s share of the combined tax obligation is paid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor additional information, including treatment of transfers between shares and charitable contribution deductions, see Regulations section 1.645-1(e).\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n If there isn\\'t an executor.\\nIf no executor has been appointed for the related estate, the trustee of the electing trust files Form 1041 as if it was an estate. File using the TIN that the QRT obtained after the death of the decedent. The trustee can choose a fiscal year as the trust\\'s tax year during the election period. Be sure to check the Decedent\\'s estate box at the top of Form 1041 and Item G if the filing trust has made a section 645 election. For Item G, the filing trustee must provide the TIN of the electing trust with the highest total asset value. The electing trust is entitled to a single $600 personal exemption on returns filed for the election period.\\nIf there is more than one electing trust, the trusts must appoint one trustee as the filing trustee. Form 1041 is filed under the name and TIN of the filing trustee\\'s trust. A statement providing the same information about the electing trusts (except the filing trust) that is listed under, If there is an executor, above must be attached to these Forms 1041. All electing trusts must choose the same tax year.\\nIf there is more than one electing trust, the filing trustee is responsible for ensuring that the filing trust\\'s share of the combined tax liability is paid.\\nFor additional information on filing requirements when there is no executor, including application of the separate share rule, see Regulations section 1.645-1(e). For information on the requirements when an executor is appointed after an election is made and the executor doesn\\'t agree to the election, see below.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nResponsibilities of the trustee when there is an executor (or there isn\\'t an executor and the trustee isn\\'t the filing trustee).\\nWhen there is an executor (or there isn\\'t an executor and the trustee isn\\'t the filing trustee), the trustee of an electing trust is responsible for the following during the election period. \\n\\n\\n\\nTo timely provide the executor with all the trust information necessary to allow the executor to file a complete, accurate, and timely Form 1041.\\n\\n\\nTo ensure that the electing trust\\'s share of the combined tax liability is paid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe trustee does not file a Form 1041 during the election period (except for a final return if the trust terminates during the election period as explained later).\\n\\n\\n\\nProcedure for completing Form 1041 for the year in which the election terminates.\\n\\xa0\\nIf there is an executor.  If there is an executor, the Form 1041 filed under the name and TIN of the related estate for the tax year in which the election terminates includes (a) the items of income, deduction, and credit for the related estate for its entire tax year, and (b) the income, deductions, and credits for the electing trust for the period that ends with the last day of the election period. If the estate won\\'t continue after the close of the tax year, indicate that this Form 1041 is a final return.\\nAt the end of the last day of the election period, the combined entity is deemed to distribute the share comprising the electing trust to a new trust. All items of income, including net capital gains, that are attributable to the share comprising the electing trust are included in the calculation of DNI of the electing trust and treated as distributed. The distribution rules of sections 661 and 662 apply to this deemed distribution. The combined entity is entitled to an income distribution deduction for this deemed distribution, and the \"new\" trust must include its share of the distribution in its income. See Regulations sections 1.645-1(e)(2)(iii) and 1.645-1(h) for more information.\\nIf the electing trust continues in existence after the termination of the election period, the trustee must file Form 1041 under the name and TIN of the trust, using the calendar year as its accounting period, if it is otherwise required to file.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf there isn\\'t an executor.\\nIf there isn\\'t an executor, the following rules apply to filing Form 1041 for the tax year in which the election period ends. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe tax year of the electing trust closes on the last day of the election period, and the Form 1041 filed for that tax year includes all items of income, deduction, and credit for the electing trust for the period beginning with the first day of the tax year and ending with the last day of the election period.\\n\\n\\nThe deemed distribution rules discussed above apply.\\n\\n\\nCheck the box to indicate that this Form 1041 is a final return.\\n\\n\\nIf the filing trust continues after the termination of the election period, the trustee must obtain a new TIN. If the trust meets the filing requirements, the trustee must file a Form 1041 under the new TIN for the period beginning with the day after the close of the election period and, in general, ending December 31 of that year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nResponsibilities of the trustee when there is an executor (or there isn\\'t an executor and the trustee isn\\'t the filing trustee).\\nIn addition to the requirements listed above under this same heading, the trustee is responsible for the following. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf the trust will not continue after the close of the election period, the trustee must file a Form 1041 under the name and TIN of the trust. Complete the entity information and items A, C, D, and F. Indicate in item F that this is a final return. Don\\'t report any items of income, deduction, or credit.\\n\\n\\nIf the trust will continue after the close of the election period, the trustee must file a Form 1041 for the trust for the tax year beginning the day after the close of the election period and, in general, ending December 31 of that year. Use the TIN obtained after the decedent\\'s death. Follow the general rules for completing the return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial filing instructions.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen the election isn\\'t made by the due date of the QRT\\'s Form 1041.\\nIf the section 645 election hasn\\'t been made by the time the QRT\\'s first income tax return would be due for the tax year beginning with the decedent\\'s death, but the trustee and executor (if any) have decided to make a section 645 election, then the QRT isn\\'t required to file a Form 1041 for the short tax year beginning with the decedent\\'s death and ending on December 31 of that year. However, if a valid election isn\\'t subsequently made, the QRT may be subject to penalties and interest for failure to file and failure to pay.\\nIf the QRT files a Form 1041 for this short period, and a valid section 645 election is subsequently made, then the trustee must file an amended Form 1041 for the electing trust, excluding all items of income, deduction, and credit of the electing trust. These amounts are then included on the first Form 1041 filed by the executor for the related estate (or the filing trustee for the electing trust filing as an estate).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLater appointed executor.\\nIf an executor for the related estate isn\\'t appointed until after the trustee has made a valid section 645 election, the executor must agree to the trustee\\'s election and they must file a revised Form 8855 within 90 days of the appointment of the executor. If the executor doesn\\'t agree to the election, the election terminates as of the date of appointment of the executor.\\nIf the executor agrees to the election, the trustee must amend any Form 1041 filed under the name and TIN of the electing trust for the period beginning with the decedent\\'s death. The amended returns are still filed under the name and TIN of the electing trust, and they must include the items of income, deduction, and credit for the related estate for the periods covered by the returns. Also, attach a statement to the amended Forms 1041 identifying the name and TIN of the related estate, and the name and address of the executor. Check the Final return box on the amended return for the tax year that ends with the appointment of the executor. Except for this amended return, all returns filed for the combined entity after the appointment of the executor must be filed under the name and TIN of the related estate.\\nIf the election terminates as the result of a later appointed executor, the executor of the related estate must file Forms 1041 under the name and TIN of the related estate for all tax years of the related estate beginning with the decedent\\'s death. The electing trust\\'s election period and tax year terminate the day before the appointment of the executor. The trustee isn\\'t required to amend any of the returns filed by the electing trust for the period prior to the appointment of the executor. The trust must file a final Form 1041 following the instructions above for completing Form 1041 in the year in which the election terminates and there is no executor.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTermination of the trust during the election period.\\nIf an electing trust terminates during the election period, the trustee of that trust must file a final Form 1041 by completing the entity information (using the trust\\'s EIN), checking the Final return box, and signing and dating the form. Don\\'t report items of income, deduction, and credit. These items are reported on the related estate\\'s return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAlaska Native Settlement Trusts\\n\\nThe trustee of an Alaska Native Settlement Trust may elect the special tax treatment for the trust and its beneficiaries provided for in section 646. The election must be made by the due date (including extensions) for filing the trust\\'s tax return for its first tax year ending after June 7, 2001. Don\\'t use Form 1041. Use Form 1041-N, U.S. Income Tax Return for Electing Alaska Native Settlement Trusts, to make the election. Additionally, Form 1041-N is the trust\\'s income tax return and satisfies the section 6039H information reporting requirement for the trust.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBankruptcy Estate\\n\\nThe bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in- possession must file Form 1041 for the estate of an individual involved in bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the United States Code if the estate has gross income for the tax year of $12,200 or more. See Bankruptcy Estates, later, for details.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCharitable Remainder Trusts\\nA section 664 charitable remainder trust (CRT) doesn’t file Form 1041. Instead, a CRT files Form 5227, Split-Interest Trust Information Return. If the CRT has any unrelated business taxable income, it also must file Form 4720, Return of Certain Excise Taxes Under Chapters 41 and 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCommon Trust Funds\\n\\nDon\\'t file Form 1041 for a common trust fund maintained by a bank. Instead, the fund may use Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, for its return. For more details, see section 584 and Regulations section 1.6032-1.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nElecting Small Business Trusts\\nElecting small business trusts file Form 1041. However, see Electing Small Business Trusts (ESBTs), later, for a discussion of the special reporting requirements for these trusts.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPooled Income Funds\\nPooled income funds file Form 1041. See Pooled Income Funds, later, for the special reporting requirements for these trusts. Additionally, pooled income funds must file Form 5227, Split-Interest Trust Information Return.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQualified Funeral Trusts\\nTrustees of pre-need funeral trusts who elect treatment under section 685 file Form 1041-QFT, U.S. Income Tax Return for Qualified Funeral Trusts. All other pre-need funeral trusts, see Grantor Type Trusts, later, for Form 1041 reporting requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQualified Settlement Funds\\n\\nThe trustee of a designated or qualified settlement fund (QSF) generally must file Form 1120-SF, U.S. Income Tax Return for Settlement Funds, instead of Form 1041.\\n\\nSpecial election.\\nIf a QSF has only one transferor, the transferor may elect to treat the QSF as a grantor type trust.\\nTo make the grantor trust election, the transferor must attach an election statement to a timely filed Form 1041, including extensions, that the administrator files for the QSF for the tax year in which the settlement fund is established. If Form 1041 isn\\'t filed because Optional Method 1 or 2 (described later) was chosen, attach the election statement to a timely filed income tax return, including extensions, of the transferor for the tax year in which the settlement fund is established.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nElection statement.\\nThe election statement may be made separately or, if filed with Form 1041, on the attachment described under Grantor Type Trusts, later. At the top of the election statement, write \"Section 1.468B-1(k) Election\" and include the transferor\\'s:\\n\\n\\n\\nName,\\n\\n\\nAddress,\\n\\n\\nTIN, and\\n\\n\\nA statement that he or she will treat the qualified settlement fund as a grantor type trust. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWidely Held Fixed Investment Trust (WHFITs)\\nTrustees and middlemen of WHFITs don\\'t file Form 1041. Instead, they report all items of gross income and proceeds on the appropriate Form 1099. For the definition of a WHFIT, see Regulations section 1.671-5(b)(22). A tax information statement that includes the information given to the IRS on Forms 1099, as well as additional information identified in Regulations section 1.671-5(e) must be given to trust interest holders. See the General Instructions for Certain Information Returns for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nElectronic Filing\\n\\nQualified fiduciaries or transmitters may be able to file Form 1041 and related schedules electronically. To become an e-file provider complete the following steps.\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate an IRS  e-Services account.\\n\\n\\nSubmit your  e-file provider application online.\\n\\n\\nPass a  suitability check.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe online application process takes 4-6 weeks to complete.\\n\\nNote.\\nExisting e-file providers must now use e-Services to make account updates.\\nHelp is available online at e-services or through the e-Help Desk at 866-255-0654 (512-416-7750 for international calls), Monday through Friday, 6:30 a.m.- 6:00 p.m. (Central time). Frequently asked questions and On-line Tutorials are available to answer questions or to guide users through the application process.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you file Form 1041 electronically, you may sign the return electronically by using a personal identification number (PIN). See Form 8879-F, IRS e-file Signature Authorization for Form 1041, for details.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm 8879-F can only be associated with a single Form 1041. Form 8879-F can\\'t be used with multiple Forms 1041.\\nForm 1041 may also be e-Filed using Form 8453-FE, U.S. Estate or Trust Declaration for an IRS e-file return.\\nFor more information about e-filing returns through MeF, see Publication 4164, Modernized e-File (MeF) Guide for Software Developers and Transmitters.\\nIf Form 1041 is e-filed and there is a balance due, the fiduciary may authorize an electronic funds withdrawal with the return.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPrivate Delivery Services\\nYou can use certain private delivery services (PDS) designated by the IRS to meet the \"timely mailing as timely filing/paying\" rule for tax returns and payments. Go to  IRS.gov/PDS for the current list of designated services.\\nThe PDS can tell you how to get written proof of the mailing date.\\nFor the IRS mailing address to use if you’re using PDS, go to  IRS.gov/PDSstreetAddresses.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPrivate delivery services can\\'t deliver items to P.O. boxes. You must use the U.S. Postal Service to mail any item to an IRS P.O. box address.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen To File\\n\\nFor calendar year estates and trusts, file Form 1041 and Schedule(s) K-1 by April 15, 2020.\\nFor fiscal year estates and trusts, file Form 1041 by the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the tax year. For example, an estate that has a tax year that ends on June 30, 2020, must file Form 1041 by October 15, 2020. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, file on the next business day.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExtension of Time To File\\nIf more time is needed to file the estate or trust return, use Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns, to apply for an automatic 5½-month extension of time to file.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPeriod Covered\\nFile the 2019 return for calendar year 2019 and fiscal years beginning in 2019 and ending in 2020. If the return is for a fiscal year or a short tax year (less than 12 months), fill in the tax year space at the top of the form.\\nThe 2019 Form 1041 may also be used for a tax year beginning in 2020 if:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust has a tax year of less than 12 months that begins and ends in 2020, and\\n\\n\\nThe 2020 Form 1041 isn\\'t available by the time the estate or trust is required to file its tax return. However, the estate or trust must show its 2020 tax year on the 2019 Form 1041 and incorporate any tax law changes that are effective for tax years beginning after 2019.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere To File\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFor all estates and trusts, including charitable and split-interest trusts (other than Charitable Remainder Trusts).\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTHEN use this address if you:\\n\\n\\nIF you are located in ...\\nAre not enclosing a check or money order ...\\nAre enclosing a check or money order ...\\n\\n\\nConnecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin\\nDepartment of the Treasury\\n\\t\\t\\tInternal Revenue Service\\n\\t\\t\\tKansas City, MO 64999–0048\\nDepartment of the Treasury\\n\\t\\t\\tInternal Revenue Service\\n\\t\\t\\tKansas City, MO 64999–0148\\n\\n\\nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming\\nDepartment of the Treasury\\n\\t\\t\\tInternal Revenue Service\\n\\t\\t\\tOgden, Utah 84201-0048\\nDepartment of the Treasury\\n\\t\\t\\tInternal Revenue Service\\n\\t\\t\\tOgden, Utah 84201-0148\\n\\n\\nA foreign country or United States possession\\nInternal Revenue Service\\n\\t\\t\\tP.O.

If there are joint fiduciaries, only one is required to sign the return.\\nA financial institution that submitted estimated tax payments for trusts for which it is the trustee must enter its EIN in the space provided for the EIN of the fiduciary. Don\\'t enter the EIN of the trust. For this purpose, a financial institution is one that maintains a Treasury Tax and Loan (TT&L) account. If you are an attorney or other individual functioning in a fiduciary capacity, leave this space blank. Don\\'t enter your individual social security number (SSN).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPaid Preparer\\n\\nGenerally, anyone who is paid to prepare a tax return must sign the return and fill in the other blanks in the \"Paid Preparer Use Only\" area of the return.\\nThe person required to sign the return must:\\n\\n\\n\\nComplete the required preparer information,\\n\\n\\nSign it in the space provided for the preparer\\'s signature (a facsimile signature is acceptable), and\\n\\n\\nGive you a copy of the return for your records.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you, as fiduciary, fill in Form 1041, leave the \"Paid Preparer Use Only\" space blank.\\nIf someone prepares this return and doesn\\'t charge you, that person should not sign the return.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPaid Preparer Authorization\\n\\nIf the fiduciary wants to allow the IRS to discuss the estate\\'s or trust\\'s 2019 tax return with the paid preparer who signed it, check the \"Yes,\" box in the signature area of the return. This authorization applies only to the individual whose signature appears in the Paid Preparer Use Only area of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return. It doesn\\'t apply to the firm, if any, shown in that section.\\nIf the \"Yes,\" box is checked, the fiduciary is authorizing the IRS to call the paid preparer to answer any questions that may arise during the processing of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return. The fiduciary is also authorizing the paid preparer to:\\n\\n\\n\\nGive the IRS any information that is missing from the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return,\\n\\n\\nCall the IRS for information about the processing of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return or the status of its refund or payment(s), and\\n\\n\\nRespond to certain IRS notices that the fiduciary has shared with the preparer about math errors, offsets, and return preparation. The notices won\\'t be sent to the preparer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe fiduciary isn\\'t authorizing the paid preparer to receive any refund check, bind the estate or trust to anything (including any additional tax liability), or otherwise represent the estate or trust before the IRS.\\nThe authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing the estate\\'s or trust\\'s 2020 tax return. If the fiduciary wants to expand the paid preparer\\'s authorization or revoke the authorization before it ends, see Pub. 947, Practice Before the IRS and Power of Attorney.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAccounting Methods\\nFigure taxable income using the method of accounting regularly used in keeping the estate\\'s or trust\\'s books and records. Generally, permissible methods include the cash method, the accrual method, or any other method authorized by the Internal Revenue Code. In all cases, the method used must clearly reflect income.\\nGenerally, the estate or trust may change its accounting method (for income as a whole or for any material item) only by getting consent on Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method. For more information, see Pub. 538, Accounting Periods and Methods.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAccounting Periods\\nFor a decedent\\'s estate, the moment of death determines the end of the decedent\\'s tax year and the beginning of the estate\\'s tax year. As executor or administrator, you choose the estate\\'s tax period when you file its first income tax return. The estate\\'s first tax year may be any period of 12 months or less that ends on the last day of a month. If you select the last day of any month other than December, you are adopting a fiscal tax year.\\nTo change the accounting period of an estate, use Form 1128, Application To Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year.\\nGenerally, a trust must adopt a calendar year. The following trusts are exempt from this requirement.\\n\\n\\n\\nA trust that is exempt from tax under section 501(a).\\n\\n\\nA charitable trust described in section 4947(a)(1).\\n\\n\\nA trust that is treated as wholly owned by a grantor under the rules of sections 671 through 679.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRounding Off to Whole Dollars\\nYou may round off cents to whole dollars on the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return and schedules. If you do round to whole dollars, you must round all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3.\\nIf you have to add two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total.\\nIf you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the decimal point. There is no cents column on the form.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEstimated Tax\\n\\nGenerally, an estate or trust must pay estimated income tax for 2020 if it expects to owe, after subtracting any withholding and credits, at least $1,000 in tax, and it expects the withholding and credits to be less than the smaller of:\\n\\n\\n\\n90% of the tax shown on the 2020 tax return, or\\n\\n\\n100% of the tax shown on the 2019 tax return (110% of that amount if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s adjusted gross income on that return is more than $150,000, and less than 2/3 of gross income for 2019 or 2020 is from farming or fishing).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHowever, if a return was not filed for 2019 or that return didn\\'t cover a full 12 months, item 2 doesn\\'t apply.\\nFor this purpose, include household employment taxes in the tax shown on the tax return, but only if either of the following is true:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust will have federal income tax withheld for 2020 (see the instructions for Schedule G, Part II, line 14), or\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust would be required to make estimated tax payments for 2020 even if it didn\\'t include household employment taxes when figuring estimated tax.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExceptions\\nEstimated tax payments aren\\'t required from:\\n\\n\\n\\nAn estate of a domestic decedent or a domestic trust that had no tax liability for the full 12-month 2019 tax year;\\n\\n\\nA decedent\\'s estate for any tax year ending before the date that is 2 years after the decedent\\'s death; or\\n\\n\\nA trust that was treated as owned by the decedent if the trust will receive the residue of the decedent\\'s estate under the will (or if no will is admitted to probate, the trust primarily responsible for paying debts, taxes, and expenses of administration) for any tax year ending before the date that is 2 years after the decedent\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information, see Form 1041-ES, Estimated Income Tax for Estates and Trusts.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nElectronic Deposits\\n\\nA financial institution that has been designated as an authorized federal tax depository, and acts as a fiduciary for at least 200 taxable trusts that are required to pay estimated tax, is required to deposit the estimated tax payments electronically using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS).\\nA fiduciary that isn\\'t required to make electronic deposits of estimated tax on behalf of a trust or an estate may voluntarily participate in EFTPS. To enroll in or get more information about EFTPS, visit the EFTPS website at eftps.gov or call 1-800-555-4477. Also, see Pub. 966, Electronic Federal Tax Payment System: A Guide to Getting Started.\\n\\nDepositing on time.\\nFor a deposit using EFTPS to be on time, the deposit must be submitted by 8:00 p.m. Eastern time the day before the due date of the deposit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSection 643(g) Election\\n\\nFiduciaries of trusts that pay estimated tax may elect under section 643(g) to have any portion of their estimated tax payments allocated to any of the beneficiaries.\\nThe fiduciary of a decedent\\'s estate may make a section 643(g) election only for the final year of the estate.\\nMake the election by filing Form 1041-T, Allocation of Estimated Tax Payments to Beneficiaries, by the 65th day after the close of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax year. Then, include that amount on Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 13, code A, for any beneficiaries for whom it was elected.\\nIf Form 1041-T was timely filed, the payments are treated as paid or credited to the beneficiary on the last day of the tax year and must be included as an other amount paid, credited, or required to be distributed on Form 1041, Schedule B, line 10. See the instructions for Schedule B, line 10, later.\\nFailure to make a timely election will result in the estimated tax payments not being transferred to the beneficiary(ies) even if you entered the amount on Schedule K-1.\\nSee the instructions for line Schedule G, Part II, line 11 for more details.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInterest and Penalties\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInterest\\nInterest is charged on taxes not paid by the due date, even if an extension of time to file is granted.\\nInterest is also charged on penalties imposed for failure to file, negligence, fraud, substantial valuation misstatements, substantial understatements of tax, and reportable transaction understatements. Interest is charged on the penalty from the due date of the return (including extensions). The interest charge is figured at a rate determined under section 6621.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLate Filing of Return\\n\\nThe law provides a penalty of 5% of the tax due for each month, or part of a month, for which a return isn\\'t filed up to a maximum of 25% of the tax due (15% for each month, or part of a month, up to a maximum of 75% if the failure to file is fraudulent). If the return is more than 60 days late, the minimum penalty is the smaller of $435 or the tax due.\\nThe penalty won\\'t be imposed if you can show that the failure to file on time was due to reasonable cause. If you receive a notice about penalty and interest after you file this return, send us an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don\\'t attach an explanation when you file Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLate Payment of Tax\\n\\nGenerally, the penalty for not paying tax when due is ½ of 1% of the unpaid amount for each month or part of a month it remains unpaid. The maximum penalty is 25% of the unpaid amount. The penalty applies to any unpaid tax on the return. Any penalty is in addition to interest charges on late payments.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you include interest on either of these penalties with your payment, identify and enter these amounts in the bottom margin of Form 1041, page 1. Don\\'t include the interest or penalty amount in the balance of tax due on line 28.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFailure To Provide Information Timely\\n\\nYou must provide Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), on or before the day you are required to file Form 1041, to each beneficiary who receives a distribution of property or an allocation of an item of the estate.\\nFor each failure to provide Schedule K-1 to a beneficiary when due and each failure to include on Schedule K-1 all the information required to be shown (or the inclusion of incorrect information), a $270 penalty may be imposed with regard to each Schedule K-1 for which a failure occurs. The maximum penalty is $3,339,000 for all such failures during a calendar year. If the requirement to report information is intentionally disregarded, each $270 penalty is increased to $550 or, if greater, 10% of the aggregate amount of items required to be reported, and the $3,339,000 maximum doesn\\'t apply.\\nThe penalty won\\'t be imposed if the fiduciary can show that not providing information timely was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUnderpaid Estimated Tax\\n\\nIf the fiduciary underpaid estimated tax, use Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, to figure any penalty. Enter the amount of any penalty on Form 1041, line 27.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTrust Fund Recovery Penalty\\n\\nThis penalty may apply if certain excise, income, social security, and Medicare taxes that must be collected or withheld aren\\'t collected or withheld, or these taxes aren\\'t paid. These taxes are generally reported on Forms 720, 941, 943, 944, or 945. The trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to have been responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. The penalty is equal to the unpaid trust fund tax.

Additionally, grantor type trusts have optional filing methods available. Pooled income funds have many similar reporting requirements that other Subchapter J trusts (other than grantor type trusts and electing small business trusts) have but there are some very important differences. These reporting differences and optional filing methods are discussed below by entity.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGrantor Type Trusts\\n\\nA trust is a grantor trust if the grantor retains certain powers or ownership benefits. This can also apply to only a portion of a trust. See Grantor Type Trust, later, for details on what makes a trust a grantor trust.\\nIn general, a grantor trust is ignored for income tax purposes and all of the income, deductions, etc., are treated as belonging directly to the grantor. This also applies to any portion of a trust that is treated as a grantor trust.\\n\\nNote.\\nIf only a portion of the trust is a grantor type trust, indicate both grantor trust and the other type of trust, for example, simple or complex trust, as the type of entities checked in Section A on page 1 of Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe following instructions apply only to grantor type trusts that are not using an optional filing method.\\n\\nHow to report.\\nIf the entire trust is a grantor trust, fill in only the entity information of Form 1041. Don\\'t show any dollar amounts on the form itself; show dollar amounts only on an attachment to the form. Don\\'t use Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) as the attachment.\\nIf only part of the trust is a grantor type trust, the portion of the income, deductions, etc., that is allocable to the non-grantor part of the trust is reported on Form 1041, under normal reporting rules. The amounts that are allocable directly to the grantor are shown only on an attachment to the form. Don\\'t use Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) as the attachment. However, Schedule K-1 is used to reflect any income distributed from the portion of the trust that isn\\'t taxable directly to the grantor or owner.\\nThe fiduciary must give the grantor (owner) of the trust a copy of the attachment.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAttachment.\\nOn the attachment, show: \\n\\n\\n\\nThe name, identifying number, and address of the person(s) to whom the income is taxable;\\n\\n\\nThe income of the trust that is taxable to the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 678. Report the income in the same detail as it would be reported on the grantor\\'s return had it been received directly by the grantor; and\\n\\n\\nAny deductions or credits that apply to this income. Report these deductions and credits in the same detail as they would be reported on the grantor\\'s return had they been received directly by the grantor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe income taxable to the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 678 and the deductions and credits that apply to that income must be reported by that person on their own income tax return.\\n\\n\\n\\nExample.\\nThe John Doe Trust is a grantor type trust. During the year, the trust sold 100 shares of ABC stock for $1,010 in which it had a basis of $10 and 200 shares of XYZ stock for $10 in which it had a $1,020 basis.\\nThe trust doesn\\'t report these transactions on Form 1041. Instead, a schedule is attached to the Form 1041 showing each stock transaction separately and in the same detail as John Doe (grantor and owner) will need to report these transactions on his Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets and Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). The trust doesn\\'t net the capital gains and losses, nor does it issue John Doe a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) showing a $10 long-term capital loss.\\n\\n\\nQSSTs.\\n\\nIncome allocated to S corporation stock held by the trust is treated as owned by the income beneficiary of the portion of the trust that owns the stock. Report this income following the rules discussed above for grantor type trusts. A QSST can\\'t elect any of the optional filing methods discussed below.\\n \\nHowever, the trust, and not the income beneficiary, is treated as the owner of the S corporation stock for figuring and attributing the tax results of a disposition of the stock. For example, if the disposition is a sale, the QSST election ends as to the stock sold and any gain or loss recognized on the sale will be that of the trust. For more information on QSSTs, see Regulations section 1.1361-1(j).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nOptional Filing Methods for Certain Grantor Type Trusts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGenerally, if a trust is treated as owned by one grantor or other person, the trustee may choose Optional Method 1 or Optional Method 2 as the trust\\'s method of reporting instead of filing Form 1041. A husband and wife will be treated as one grantor for purposes of these two optional methods if:\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of the trust is treated as owned by the husband and wife, and\\n\\n\\nThe husband and wife file their income tax return jointly for that tax year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGenerally, if a trust is treated as owned by two or more grantors or other persons, the trustee may choose Optional Method 3 as the trust\\'s method of reporting instead of filing Form 1041.\\nOnce you choose the trust\\'s filing method, you must follow the rules under Changing filing methods if you want to change to another method.\\n\\nExceptions.\\nThe following trusts can\\'t report using the optional filing methods. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common trust fund (as defined in section 584(a)).\\n\\n\\nA foreign trust or a trust that has any of its assets located outside the United States.\\n\\n\\nA qualified subchapter S trust (as defined in section 1361(d)(3)). \\n\\n\\nA trust all of which is treated as owned by one grantor or one other person whose tax year is other than a calendar year.\\n\\n\\nA trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons, one of which isn\\'t a U.S. person.\\n\\n\\nA trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons if at least one grantor or other person is an exempt recipient for information reporting purposes, unless at least one grantor or other person isn\\'t an exempt recipient and the trustee reports without treating any of the grantors or other persons as exempt recipients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOptional Method 1.\\nFor a trust treated as owned by one grantor or by one other person, the trustee must give all payers of income during the tax year the name and TIN of the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust and the address of the trust. This method may be used only if the owner of the trust provides the trustee with a signed Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification. In addition, unless the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust is the trustee or a co-trustee of the trust, the trustee must give the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that: \\n\\n\\n\\nShows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust;\\n\\n\\nIdentifies the payer of each item of income;\\n\\n\\nExplains how the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when figuring the grantor\\'s or other person\\'s taxable income or tax; and\\n\\n\\nInforms the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on his or her income tax return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGrantor trusts that haven\\'t applied for an EIN and are going to file under Optional Method 1 don\\'t need an EIN for the trust as long as they continue to report under that method.\\n\\n\\nOptional Method 2.\\nFor a trust treated as owned by one grantor or by one other person, the trustee must give all payers of income during the tax year the name, address, and TIN of the trust. The trustee also must file with the IRS the appropriate Forms 1099 to report the income or gross proceeds paid to the trust during the tax year that shows the trust as the payer and the grantor, or other person treated as owner, as the payee. The trustee must report each type of income in the aggregate and each item of gross proceeds separately. The due date for any Forms 1099 required to be filed with the IRS by a trustee under this method is February 28, 2020 (March 31, 2020, if filed electronically).\\nIn addition, unless the grantor, or other person treated as owner of the trust, is the trustee or a co-trustee of the trust, the trustee must give the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that: \\n\\n\\n\\nShows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust;\\n\\n\\nExplains how the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when figuring the grantor\\'s or other person\\'s taxable income or tax; and\\n\\n\\nInforms the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on his or her income tax return. This statement satisfies the requirement to give the recipient copies of the Forms 1099 filed by the trustee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOptional Method 3.\\nFor a trust treated as owned by two or more grantors or other persons, the trustee must give all payers of income during the tax year the name, address, and TIN of the trust. The trustee also must file with the IRS the appropriate Forms 1099 to report the income or gross proceeds paid to the trust by all payers during the tax year attributable to the part of the trust treated as owned by each grantor, or other person, showing the trust as the payer and each grantor, or other person treated as owner of the trust, as the payee. The trustee must report each type of income in the aggregate and each item of gross proceeds separately. The due date for any Forms 1099 required to be filed with the IRS by a trustee under this method is February 28, 2020 (March 31, 2020, if filed electronically).\\nIn addition, the trustee must give each grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that: \\n\\n\\n\\nShows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust attributable to the part of the trust treated as owned by the grantor or other person;\\n\\n\\nExplains how the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when figuring the grantor\\'s or other person\\'s taxable income or tax; and\\n\\n\\nInforms the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on his or her income tax return. This statement satisfies the requirement to give the recipient copies of the Forms 1099 filed by the trustee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nChanging filing methods.\\nA trustee who previously had filed Form 1041 can change to one of the optional methods by filing a final Form 1041 for the tax year that immediately precedes the first tax year for which the trustee elects to report under one of the optional methods. On the front of the final Form 1041, the trustee must write \"Pursuant to section 1.671-4(g), this is the final Form 1041 for this grantor trust,\" and check the Final return box in item F.\\nFor more details on changing reporting methods, including changes from one optional method to another, see Regulations section 1.671-4(g).\\n\\n\\nBackup withholding.\\n\\nThe following grantor trusts are treated as payors for purposes of backup withholding. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nA trust established after 1995, all of which is owned by two or more grantors (treating spouses filing a joint return as one grantor).\\n\\n\\nA trust with 10 or more grantors established after 1983 but before 1996.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\xa0\\n \\nThe trustee must withhold a certain percentage of reportable payments made to any grantor who is subject to backup withholding.\\n \\nFor more information, see section 3406 and its regulations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPooled Income Funds\\n\\nIf you are filing for a pooled income fund, attach a statement to support the following:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe calculation of the yearly rate of return,\\n\\n\\nThe computation of the deduction for distributions to the beneficiaries, and\\n\\n\\nThe computation of any charitable deduction.\\n\\n\\n\\nSee section 642 and the regulations thereunder for more information.\\nYou don\\'t have to complete Schedules A or B of Form 1041.\\nAlso, you must file Form 5227, Split-Interest Trust Information Return, for the pooled income fund. However, if all amounts were transferred in trust before May 27, 1969, or if an amount was transferred to the trust after May 26, 1969, for which no deduction was allowed under any of the sections listed under section 4947(a)(2), then Form 5227 does not have to be filed.\\n\\nNote.\\nForm 1041-A is no longer filed by pooled income funds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nElecting Small Business Trusts (ESBTs)\\n\\nSpecial rules apply when figuring the tax on the S portion of an ESBT.  The S portion of an ESBT is the portion of the trust that consists of stock in one or more S corporations and isn\\'t treated as a grantor type trust. The tax on the S portion:\\n\\n\\n\\nMust be figured separately from the tax on the remainder of the ESBT (if any) and attached to the return, and\\n\\n\\nIs entered on Schedule G, Part I, line 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe tax on the remainder (non-S portion) of the ESBT is figured in the normal manner on Form 1041.\\n\\nTax computation attachment.\\nAttach to the return the tax computation for the S portion of the ESBT. \\nIf you need to complete and attach a tax form or worksheet for the S portion of the trust, write \"ESBT\" in the top margin of the tax form, worksheet, or attachment.\\nTo compute the tax on the S portion: \\n\\n\\n\\nTreat that portion of the ESBT as if it were a separate trust; \\n\\n\\nInclude only the income, losses, deductions, and credits allocated to the ESBT as an S corporation shareholder and gain or loss from the disposition of S corporation stock;\\n\\n\\nAggregate items of income, losses, deductions, and credits allocated to the ESBT as an S corporation shareholder if the S portion of the ESBT has stock in more than one S corporation;\\n\\n\\nDeduct state and local income taxes directly related to the S portion or allocated to the S portion if the allocation is reasonable in light of all the circumstances and administrative expenses that wouldn\\'t have been incurred if the S corporation shares were not held by the trust;\\n\\n\\nDeduct interest expense paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to acquire stock in an S corporation;\\n\\n\\nDeduct charitable contributions attributable to the S portion. See Pub. 526 to figure the amount of the deduction if either of the following apply.\\n\\n\\n\\nCash contributions or contributions of ordinary income property are more than 30% of the AGI of the S portion.\\n\\n\\nGifts of capital gain property are more than 20% of the AGI of the S portion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t claim a deduction for capital losses in excess of capital gains;\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t claim an income distribution deduction or an exemption amount;\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t claim an exemption amount in figuring the AMT; and\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t use the tax rate schedule to figure the tax. The tax is 37% of the S portion\\'s taxable income except in figuring the maximum tax on qualified dividends and capital gains. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor additional information, see Regulations section 1.641(c)-1.\\n\\n\\nOther information.\\nWhen figuring the tax and DNI on the remaining (non-S) portion of the trust, disregard the S corporation items.\\nDon\\'t apportion to the beneficiaries any of the S corporation items.\\nIf the ESBT consists entirely of stock in one or more S corporations, don\\'t make any entries on lines 1–23\\nof page 1. Instead: \\n\\n\\n\\nComplete the entity portion;\\n\\n\\nFollow the instructions above for figuring the tax on the S corporation items; \\n\\n\\nEnter the ESBT tax on Schedule G, Part I, line 4;\\n\\n\\nCarry the Total tax from line 9 of Schedule G, Part I, to line 24 on page 1; and\\n\\n\\nComplete the rest of the return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe grantor portion (if any) of an ESBT will follow the rules discussed under Grantor Type Trusts, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBankruptcy Estates\\n\\nThe bankruptcy estate that is created when an individual debtor files a petition under either chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code is treated as a separate taxable entity. The bankruptcy estate is administered by a trustee or a debtor-in-possession. If the case is later dismissed by the bankruptcy court, the individual debtor is treated as if the bankruptcy petition had never been filed.\\nA separate taxable entity isn\\'t created if a partnership or corporation files a petition under any chapter of title 11 of the U.S. Code.\\nFor additional information about bankruptcy estates, see Pub. 908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must File\\nEvery trustee (or debtor-in-possession) for an individual\\'s bankruptcy estate under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code must file a return if the bankruptcy estate has gross income of $12,200 or more for tax years beginning in 2019.\\nFailure to do so may result in an estimated Request for Administrative Expenses being filed by the IRS in the bankruptcy proceeding or a motion to compel filing of the return.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe filing of a tax return for the bankruptcy estate doesn\\'t relieve the individual debtor(s) of his, her, or their individual tax obligations.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEIN\\nEvery bankruptcy estate of an individual required to file a return must have its own EIN. The SSN of the individual debtor can\\'t be used as the EIN for the bankruptcy estate.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAccounting Period\\n\\n\\n\\nA bankruptcy estate is allowed to have a fiscal year. However, this period can\\'t be longer than 12 months.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen To File\\n\\n\\n\\nFile Form 1041 on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the tax year. Use Form 7004 to apply for an automatic 6-month extension of time to file.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nDisclosure of Return Information\\n\\n\\n\\nUnder section 6103(e)(5), tax returns of individual debtors who have filed for bankruptcy under chapters 7 or 11 of title 11 are, upon written request, open to inspection by or disclosure to the trustee.\\nThe returns subject to disclosure to the trustee are those for the year the bankruptcy begins and prior years. Use Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return, to request copies of the individual debtor\\'s tax returns.\\nIf the bankruptcy case wasn\\'t voluntary, disclosure can\\'t be made before the bankruptcy court has entered an order for relief, unless the court rules that the disclosure is needed for determining whether relief should be ordered.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTransfer of Tax Attributes From the Individual Debtor to the Bankruptcy Estate\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bankruptcy estate succeeds to the following tax attributes of the individual debtor:\\n\\n\\n\\nNet operating loss (NOL)\\n\\tcarryovers;\\n\\n\\nCharitable contribution\\n\\tcarryovers;\\n\\n\\nRecovery of tax benefit items;\\n\\n\\nCredit carryovers;\\n\\n\\nCapital loss carryovers;\\n\\n\\nBasis, holding period, and\\n\\tcharacter of assets;\\n\\n\\nMethod of accounting;\\n\\n\\nUnused passive activity losses;\\n\\n\\nUnused passive activity credits;\\n\\tand\\n\\n\\nUnused section 465 losses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome, Deductions, and Credits\\n\\n\\n\\nUnder section 1398(c), the taxable income of the bankruptcy estate generally is figured in the same manner as that of an individual. The gross income of the bankruptcy estate includes any income included in property of the estate as defined in U.S. Code, title 11, sections 541 and 1115.\\nUnder section 1115 of title 11, property of the bankruptcy estate includes (a) earnings from services performed by the debtor after the beginning of the case (both wages and self-employment income) and before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under a different chapter and (b) property described in section 541 of title 11 and income earned therefrom that the debtor acquires after the beginning of the case and before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted. If section 1115 of title 11 applies, the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income includes, as described above, (a) the debtor\\'s earnings from services performed after the beginning of the case and (b) the income from property acquired after the beginning of the case.\\nThe income from property owned by the debtor when the case began is also included in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income. However, if this property is exempted from the bankruptcy estate or is abandoned by the trustee or debtor-in-possession, the income from the property isn\\'t included in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income. Also included in income is gain from the sale of the bankruptcy estate\\'s property. To figure gain, the trustee or debtor-in-possession must determine the correct basis of the property.\\nTo determine whether any amount paid or incurred by the bankruptcy estate is allowable as a deduction or credit, or is treated as wages for employment tax purposes, treat the amount as if it were paid or incurred by the individual debtor in the same trade or business or other activity the debtor engaged in before the bankruptcy proceedings began.\\n\\nAdministrative expenses.\\nThe bankruptcy estate is allowed a deduction for any administrative expense allowed under section 503 of title 11 of the U.S. Code, and any fee or charge assessed under chapter 123 of title 28 of the U.S. Code, to the extent not disallowed under an Internal Revenue Code provision (for example, section 263, 265, or 275).\\n\\n\\nAdministrative expense loss.\\nWhen figuring an NOL, nonbusiness deductions (including administrative expenses) are limited under section 172(d)(4) to the bankruptcy estate\\'s nonbusiness income. The excess nonbusiness deductions are an administrative expense loss that may be carried back to each of the 3 preceding tax years and forward to each of the 7 succeeding tax years of the bankruptcy estate. The amount of an administrative expense loss that may be carried to any tax year is determined after the NOL deductions allowed for that year. An administrative expense loss is allowed only to the bankruptcy estate and can\\'t be carried to any tax year of the individual debtor.\\n\\n\\nCarryback of NOLs and credits.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor tax years ending after 2017, only NOLs generated from certain farming losses can be carried back. See Pubs. 536 and 225 for more information.\\nIf the bankruptcy estate itself incurs an NOL (apart from losses carried forward to the estate from the individual debtor), it can carry back its NOLs not only to previous tax years of the bankruptcy estate, but also to tax years of the individual debtor prior to the year in which the bankruptcy proceedings began.\\nExcess credits, such as the foreign tax credit, also may be carried back to pre-bankruptcy years of the individual debtor.\\n\\n\\nStandard deduction.\\nA bankruptcy estate that doesn\\'t itemize deductions is allowed a standard deduction of $12,200 for tax year 2019. \\n\\n\\nDischarge of indebtedness.\\nIn a title 11 case, gross income doesn\\'t include amounts that normally would be included in gross income resulting from the discharge of indebtedness. However, any amounts excluded from gross income must be applied to reduce certain tax attributes in a certain order. Attach Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness (and Section 1082 Basis Adjustment), to show the reduction of tax attributes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTax Rate Schedule\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure the tax for the bankruptcy estate using the tax rate schedule below. Enter the tax on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 12a.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf taxable income is:\\n\\n\\nOver—\\nBut not over—\\nThe tax is:\\nOf the amount over—\\n\\n\\n$0\\n$9,700\\n10%\\n$0\\n\\n\\n9,700\\n39,475\\n$970.00 + 12%\\n9,700\\n\\n\\n39,475\\n84,200\\n4,543.00 + 22%\\n39,475\\n\\n\\n84,200\\n160,725\\n14,382.50 + 24%\\n84,200\\n\\n\\n160,725\\n204,100\\n32,748.50 + 32%\\n160,725\\n\\n\\n204,100\\n306,175\\n46,628.50 + 35%\\n204,100\\n\\n\\n306,175\\n......\\n82,354.75 + 37%\\n306,175\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nPrompt Determination of Tax Liability\\n\\n\\n\\nTo request a prompt determination of the tax liability of the bankruptcy estate, the trustee or debtor-in-possession must file a written request for the determination with the IRS. The request must be submitted in duplicate and executed under penalties of perjury. The request must include a statement indicating that it is a request for prompt determination of tax liability and: (a) the return type, and all the tax periods for which prompt determination is sought; (b) the name and location of the office where the return was filed; (c) the debtor\\'s name; (d) the debtor\\'s SSN, TIN, or EIN; (e) the type of bankruptcy estate; (f) the bankruptcy case number; and (g) the court where the bankruptcy is pending. Send the request to the Centralized Insolvency Operation, P.O. Box 7346, Philadelphia, PA 19101-7346 (marked \"Request for Prompt Determination\").\\nThe IRS will notify the trustee or debtor-in-possession within 60 days from receipt of the request if the return filed by the trustee or debtor-in-possession has been selected for examination or has been accepted as filed. If the return is selected for examination, it will be examined as soon as possible. The IRS will notify the trustee or debtor-in-possession of any tax due within 180 days from receipt of the request or within any additional time permitted by the bankruptcy court.\\nSee Rev. Proc. 2006-24, 2006-22 I.R.B. 943, available at IRS.gov/irb/2006-22_IRB/ar12.html, modified by Announcement 2011–77, available at IRS.gov/irb/2011-51_IRB/ar13.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Filing Instructions for Bankruptcy Estates\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Form 1041 only as a transmittal for Form 1040 or 1040-SR. In the top margin of Form 1040 or 1040-SR write \"Attachment to Form 1041. DO NOT DETACH.\" Attach Form 1040 or 1040-SR to Form 1041. Complete only the identification area at the top of Form 1041. Enter the name of the individual debtor in the following format: \"John Q. Public Bankruptcy Estate.\" Beneath, enter the name of the trustee in the following format: \"Avery Snow, Trustee.\" In item D, enter the date the petition was filed or the date of conversion to a chapter 7 or 11 case.\\nEnter on Form 1041, line 24, the total tax from line 16 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Complete lines 25 through 30 of Form 1041, and sign and date it.\\nIn a chapter 11 case filed after October 16, 2005, the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income may be affected by section 1115 of title 11 of the U.S. Code. See Income, Deductions, and Credits earlier. The debtor may receive a Form W-2, 1099-INT, 1099-DIV, or 1099-MISC or other information return reporting wages or other income to the debtor for the entire year, even though some or all of this income is includible in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income under section 1115 of title 11 of the U.S. Code. If this happens, the income reported to the debtor on the Form W-2 or 1099, or other information return (and the withheld income tax shown on these forms) must be reasonably allocated between the debtor and the bankruptcy estate. The debtor-in-possession (or the chapter 11 trustee, if one was appointed) must attach a schedule that shows (a) all the income reported on the Form W-2, Form 1099, or other information return, (b) the portion of this income includible in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income, and (c) all the withheld income tax, if any, and the portion of withheld tax reasonably allocated to the bankruptcy estate. Also, the debtor-in-possesion (or the chapter 11 trustee, if one was appointed) must attach a copy of the Form W-2, if any, issued to the debtor for the tax year if the Form W-2 reports wages to the debtor and some or all of the wages are includible in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income because of section 1115 of title 11 of the U.S. Code. For more details, including acceptable allocation methods, see Notice 2006-83, 2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at IRS.gov/irb/2006-40_IRB/ar12.html.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nName of Estate or Trust\\nCopy the exact name of the estate or trust from the Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, that you used to apply for the EIN. If the name of the trust was changed during the tax year for which you are filing, enter the trust\\'s new name and check the Change in trust\\'s name box in item F.\\nIf a grantor type trust (discussed later), write the name, identification number, and address of the grantor(s) or other owner(s) in parentheses after the name of the trust.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nName and Title of Fiduciary\\nEnter the name and title of the fiduciary. If the name entered is different than the name on the prior year\\'s return, see Change in Fiduciary\\'s Name and Change in Fiduciary, later.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAddress\\nInclude the suite, room, or other unit number after the street address. If the post office doesn\\'t deliver mail to the street address and the fiduciary has a P.O. box, show the box number instead.\\nIf you want a third party (such as an accountant or an attorney) to receive mail for the estate or trust, enter on the street address line \"C/O\" followed by the third party\\'s name and street address or P.O. box.\\nIf the estate or trust has had a change of address (including a change to an \"in care of\" name and address) and did not file Form 8822-B, Change of Address or Responsible Party — Business, check the Change in fiduciary\\'s address box in item F.\\nIf the estate or trust has a change of mailing address (including a new \"in care of\" name and address) or responsible party after filing its return, file Form 8822-B to notify the IRS of the change.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA. Type of Entity\\nCheck the appropriate box(es) that describes the entity for which you are filing the return.\\nIn some cases, more than one box is checked. Check all boxes that apply to your trust. For example, if only a portion of a trust is a grantor type trust or if only a portion of an electing small business trust is the S portion, then more than one box is checked.\\n\\nNote.\\nDetermination of entity status is made on an annual basis.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThere are special reporting requirements for grantor type trusts, pooled income funds, electing small business trusts, and bankruptcy estates. See Special Reporting Instructions, earlier.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDecedent\\'s Estate\\n\\nAn estate of a deceased person is a taxable entity separate from the decedent. It generally continues to exist until the final distribution of the assets of the estate is made to the heirs and other beneficiaries. The income earned from the property of the estate during the period of administration or settlement must be accounted for and reported by the estate.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSimple Trust\\n\\nA trust may qualify as a simple trust if:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trust instrument requires that all income must be distributed currently;\\n\\n\\nThe trust instrument doesn\\'t provide that any amounts are to be paid, permanently set aside, or used for charitable purposes; and\\n\\n\\nThe trust doesn\\'t distribute amounts allocated to the corpus of the trust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nComplex Trust\\n\\nA complex trust is any trust that doesn\\'t qualify as a simple trust as explained above.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQualified Disability Trust\\nA qualified disability trust is any nongrantor trust:\\n\\n\\n\\nDescribed in 42 U.S.C. 1396p(c)(2)(B)(iv) and established solely for the benefit of an individual under 65 years of age who is disabled, and\\n\\n\\nAll the beneficiaries of which are determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to have been disabled for some part of the tax year within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA trust will not fail to meet item 2 above just because the trust\\'s corpus may revert to a person who isn\\'t disabled after the trust ceases to have any disabled beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nESBT (S Portion Only)\\n\\nThe S portion of an ESBT is the portion of the trust that consists of S corporation stock and that isn\\'t treated as owned by the grantor or another person. See Electing Small Business Trusts (ESBTs), earlier, for more information about an ESBT.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGrantor Type Trust\\n\\nA grantor type trust is a legal trust under applicable state law that isn\\'t recognized as a separate taxable entity for income tax purposes because the grantor or other substantial owners have not relinquished complete dominion and control over the trust.\\nGenerally, for transfers made in trust after March 1, 1986, the grantor is treated as the owner of any portion of a trust in which he or she has a reversionary interest in either the income or corpus therefrom, if, as of the inception of that portion of the trust, the value of the reversionary interest is more than 5% of the value of that portion. Also, the grantor is treated as holding any power or interest that was held by either the grantor\\'s spouse at the time that the power or interest was created or who became the grantor\\'s spouse after the creation of that power or interest. See Grantor Type Trusts, earlier, for more information.\\n\\nPre-need funeral trusts.\\n\\nThe purchasers of pre-need funeral services are the grantors and the owners of pre-need funeral trusts established under state laws. See Rev. Rul. 87-127, 1987-2 C.B. 156. However, the trustees of pre-need funeral trusts can elect to file the return and pay the tax for qualified funeral trusts. For more information, see Form 1041-QFT, U.S. Income Tax Return for Qualified Funeral Trusts.\\n\\n\\nNonqualified deferred compensation plans.\\n\\nTaxpayers may adopt and maintain grantor trusts in connection with nonqualified deferred compensation plans (sometimes referred to as \"rabbi trusts\"). Rev. Proc. 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, provides a \"model grantor trust\" for use in rabbi trust arrangements. The procedure also provides guidance for requesting rulings on the plans that use these trusts.\\n\\n\\nQSSTs.\\n\\nThe beneficiary of a qualified subchapter S trust is treated as the substantial owner of that portion of the trust which consists of stock in an S corporation for which an election under section 1361(d)(2) has been made. See QSSTs, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBankruptcy Estate\\n\\nA chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy estate is a separate and distinct taxable entity from the individual debtor for federal income tax purposes. See Bankruptcy Estates, earlier.\\nFor more information, see section 1398 and Pub. 908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPooled Income Fund\\n\\nA pooled income fund is a split-interest trust with a remainder interest for a public charity and a life income interest retained by the donor or for another person. The property is held in a pool with other pooled income fund property and doesn\\'t include any tax-exempt securities. The income for a retained life interest is figured using the yearly rate of return earned by the trust. See section 642(c) and the related regulations for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nB. Number of Schedules K-1 Attached\\nEvery trust or decedent\\'s estate claiming an income distribution deduction on page 1, line 18, must enter the number of Schedules K-1 (Form 1041) that are attached to Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nC. Employer Identification Number\\nEvery estate or trust that is required to file Form 1041 must have an EIN. An EIN may be applied for:\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline at IRS.gov/EIN. The EIN is issued immediately once the application information is validated.\\n\\n\\nBy mailing or faxing Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf the estate or trust hasn\\'t received its EIN by the time the return is due, write \"Applied for\" and the date you applied in the space for the EIN. For more details, see Pub. 583, Starting a Business and Keeping Records.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nD. Date Entity Created\\nEnter the date the trust was created, or, if a decedent\\'s estate, the date of the decedent\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nE. Nonexempt Charitable and Split-Interest Trusts\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSection 4947(a)(1) Trust\\n\\nCheck this box if the trust is a nonexempt charitable trust within the meaning of section 4947(a)(1).\\nA nonexempt charitable trust is a trust:\\n\\n\\n\\nThat isn\\'t exempt from tax under section 501(a);\\n\\n\\nIn which all of the unexpired interests are devoted to one or more charitable purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B); and\\n\\n\\nFor which a deduction was allowed under section 170 (for individual taxpayers) or similar Code section for personal holding companies, foreign personal holding companies, or estates or trusts (including a deduction for estate or gift tax purposes).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNonexempt charitable trust treated as a private foundation.\\n\\nIf a nonexempt charitable trust is treated as though it were a private foundation under section 509, then the fiduciary must file Form 990-PF, Return of Private Foundation, in addition to Form 1041.\\n \\nIf a nonexempt charitable trust is treated as though it were a private foundation, and it has no taxable income under Subtitle A, it may check the box on Form 990-PF, Part VII-A, line 15 and enter the tax-exempt interest received or accrued during the year on that line, instead of filing Form 1041 to meet its section 6012 filing requirement for that tax year.\\n \\n\\n\\xa0\\nExcise taxes.\\nIf a nonexempt charitable trust is treated as a private foundation, then it is subject to the same excise taxes under chapters 41 and 42 that a private foundation is subject to. If the nonexempt charitable trust is liable for any of these taxes (except the section 4940 tax), then it reports these taxes on Form 4720, Return of Certain Excise Taxes Under Chapters 41 and 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. Taxes paid by the trust on Form 4720 or on Form 990-PF (the section 4940 tax) can\\'t be taken as a deduction on Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNot a Private Foundation\\n\\nCheck this box if the nonexempt charitable trust (section 4947(a)(1)) isn\\'t treated as a private foundation under section 509. For more information, see Regulations section 53.4947-1.\\n\\nOther returns that must be filed.\\n\\nIf a nonexempt charitable trust isn\\'t treated as though it were a private foundation, the fiduciary must file Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax, or Form 990-EZ, Short Form Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax, in addition to Form 1041, if the trust meets the filing requirements for either of those forms.\\n \\nIf a nonexempt charitable trust isn\\'t treated as though it were a private foundation, and it has no taxable income under Subtitle A, it may answer \"Yes\" on Form 990, Part V, line 12a and enter the tax-exempt interest received or accrued during the year on Form 990, Part V, line 12b instead of filing Form 1041 to meet its section 6012 filing requirement for that tax year (or if Form 990-EZ is filed instead of Form 990, you may check the box on Form 990-EZ, line 43 and enter the tax-exempt interest received or accrued during the year on that line).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSection 4947(a)(2) Trust\\n\\nCheck this box if the trust is a split-interest trust described in section 4947(a)(2).\\nA split-interest trust is a trust that:\\n\\n\\n\\nIsn\\'t exempt from tax under section 501(a);\\n\\n\\nHas some unexpired interests that are devoted to purposes other than religious, charitable, or similar purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B); and\\n\\n\\nHas amounts transferred in trust after May 26, 1969, for which a deduction was allowed under section 170 (for individual taxpayers) or similar Code sections for personal holding companies, foreign personal holding companies, or estates or trusts (including a deduction for estate or gift tax purposes).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOther returns that must be filed.\\n\\nThe fiduciary of a split-interest trust must file Form 5227. However, see the Instructions for Form 5227 for the exception that applies to split-interest trusts other than section 664 charitable remainder trusts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nF. Initial Return, Amended Return, etc.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmended Return\\n\\nIf you are filing an amended Form 1041:\\n\\n\\n\\nCheck the \"Amended return\" box in Item F,\\n\\n\\nComplete the entire return,\\n\\n\\nCorrect the appropriate lines with the new information, and\\n\\n\\nRefigure the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax liability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNote. If you are amending the return for an NOL carryback, also check the \"Net operating loss carryback\" box in Item F.\\nIf the total tax on line 24 is larger on the amended return than on the original return, you generally should pay the difference with the amended return. However, you should adjust this amount if there is any increase or decrease in the total payments shown on line 26.\\nAttach a sheet that explains the reason for the amendments and identifies the lines and amounts being changed on the amended return.\\n\\nAmended Schedule H (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\\nIf you discover an error on a Schedule H that you previously filed with Form 1041, file an \"Amended\" Form 1041 and attach a corrected Schedule H.\\nIn the top margin of your corrected Schedule H, write \"CORRECTED\" and the date you discovered the error. Also, on an attachment explain the reason for your correction. If you owe tax, pay the tax in full with your amended Form 1041. If you overpaid tax on a previously filed Schedule H, depending on whether you choose the adjustment or claim for refund process to correct the error, you must either repay or reimburse the employee\\'s share of social security and Medicare tax or get the employee\\'s consent to the filing of a refund claim for their share. See Pub. 926, Household Employer\\'s Tax Guide, for more information.\\n\\n\\nAmended Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).\\nIf the amended return results in a change to income, or a change in distribution of any income or other information provided to a beneficiary, an amended Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) must also be filed with the amended Form 1041 and given to each beneficiary. Check the \"Amended K-1\" box at the top of the amended Schedule K-1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFinal Return\\n\\nCheck this box if this is a final return because the estate or trust has terminated. Also, check the \"Final K-1\" box at the top of Schedule K-1.\\nIf, on the final return, there are excess deductions, an unused capital loss carryover, or an NOL carryover, see the instructions for Schedule K-1, box 11, later.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nChange in Trust\\'s Name\\nIf the name of the trust has changed from the name shown on the prior year\\'s return (or Form SS-4 if this is the first return being filed), be sure to check this box.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nChange in Fiduciary\\nIf a different fiduciary enters his or her name on the line for Name and title of fiduciary than was shown on the prior year\\'s return (or Form SS-4 if this is the first return being filed) and you didn\\'t file a Form 8822-B, be sure to check this box. If there is a change in the fiduciary whose address is used as the mailing address for the estate or trust after the return is filed, use Form 8822-B to notify the IRS.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nChange in Fiduciary\\'s Name\\nIf the fiduciary changed his or her name from the name that he or she entered on the prior year\\'s return (or Form SS-4 if this is the first return being filed), be sure to check this box.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nChange in Fiduciary\\'s Address\\nIf the same fiduciary who filed the prior year\\'s return (or Form SS-4 if this is the first return being filed) files the current year\\'s return and changed the address on the return (including a change to an \"in care of\" name and address), and didn\\'t report the change on Form 8822-B, check this box.\\nIf the address shown on Form 1041 changes after you file the form (including a change to an \"in care of\" name and address), file Form 8822-B to notify the IRS of the change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nG. Section 645 Election\\n\\nIf a section 645 election was made by filing Form 8855, check the box in item G. See Special Rule for Certain Revocable Trusts under Who Must File and Form 8855 for more information about this election.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIncome\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDetermining Qualified Business Income\\nThe estate\\'s or trust\\'s qualified business income includes items of income, gain, deduction, and loss that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and included or allowed in determining taxable income for the year. This includes the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from trades or business conducted by partnerships (other than PTPs), S corporations, and other estates or trusts. For more information see section 199A, Form 8995 Instructions, and Form 8995-A Instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSpecial Rule for Blind Trust\\n\\nIf you are reporting income from a qualified blind trust (under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978), don\\'t identify the payer of any income to the trust but complete the rest of the return as provided in the instructions. Also write \"Blind Trust\" at the top of page 1.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExtraterritorial Income Exclusion\\n\\nThe extraterritorial income exclusion isn\\'t allowed for transactions after 2006. However, income from certain long-term sales and leases may still qualify for the exclusion. For details and to figure the amount of the exclusion, see Form 8873, Extraterritorial Income Exclusion, and its separate instructions. The estate or trust must report the extraterritorial income exclusion on line 15a of Form 1041, page 1.\\nAlthough the extraterritorial income exclusion is entered on line 15a, it is an exclusion from income and should be treated as tax-exempt income when completing other parts of the return.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 1—Interest Income\\n\\nReport the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of all taxable interest income that was received during the tax year. Examples of taxable interest include interest from:\\n\\n\\n\\nAccounts (including certificates of deposit and money market accounts) with banks, credit unions, and thrift institutions;\\n\\n\\nNotes, loans, and mortgages;\\n\\n\\nU.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds;\\n\\n\\nU.S. savings bonds;\\n\\n\\nOriginal issue discount; and\\n\\n\\nIncome received as a regular interest holder of a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor taxable bonds acquired after 1987, amortizable bond premium is treated as an offset to the interest income instead of as a separate interest deduction. See Pub. 550.\\nFor the year of the decedent\\'s death, Forms 1099-INT issued in the decedent\\'s name may include interest income earned after the date of death that should be reported on the income tax return of the decedent\\'s estate. When preparing the decedent\\'s final income tax return, report on Schedule B (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 1 the total interest shown on Form 1099-INT. Under the last entry on line 1, subtotal all the interest reported on line 1. Below the subtotal, write \"Form 1041\" and the name and address shown on Form 1041 for the decedent\\'s estate. Also, show the part of the interest reported on Form 1041 and subtract it from the subtotal.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 2a—Total Ordinary Dividends\\nReport the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of all ordinary dividends received during the tax year.\\nFor the year of the decedent\\'s death, Forms 1099-DIV issued in the decedent\\'s name may include dividends earned after the date of death that should be reported on the income tax return of the decedent\\'s estate. When preparing the decedent\\'s final income tax return, report on Schedule B (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 5 the ordinary dividends shown on Form 1099-DIV. Under the last entry on line 5, subtotal all the dividends reported on line 5. Below the subtotal, write \"Form 1041\" and the name and address shown on Form 1041 for the decedent\\'s estate.

Don\\'t reduce the amounts on line 2b by any other allocable expenses.\\n\\nNote.\\nThe beneficiary\\'s share (as figured above) may differ from the amount entered on line 2b of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).\\n\\n\\nQualified dividends.\\nQualified dividends are eligible for a lower tax rate than other ordinary income. Generally, these dividends are reported to the estate or trust in box 1b of Form(s) 1099-DIV. See Pub. 550 for the definition of qualified dividends if the estate or trust received dividends not reported on Form 1099-DIV.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nException.\\nSome dividends may be reported to the estate or trust as in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV but aren\\'t qualified dividends. These include: \\n\\n\\n\\nDividends received on any share of stock that the estate or trust held for less than 61 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the purchaser of a stock isn\\'t entitled to receive the next dividend payment. When counting the number of days the stock was held, include the day the estate or trust disposed of the stock but not the day it acquired the stock. However, you can\\'t count certain days during which the estate\\'s or trust\\'s risk of loss was diminished. See Pub. 550 for more details.\\n\\n\\nDividends attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days that the estate or trust received on any share of preferred stock held for less than 91 days during the 181-day period that began 90 days before the ex-dividend date. When counting the number of days the stock was held, include the day the estate or trust disposed of the stock but not the day it acquired the stock. However, you can\\'t count certain days during which the estate\\'s or trust\\'s risk of loss was diminished. See Pub. 550 for more details. Preferred dividends attributable to periods totaling less than 367 days are subject to the 61-day holding period rule above.\\n\\n\\nDividends on any share of stock to the extent that the estate or trust is under an obligation (including a short sale) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.\\n\\n\\nPayments in lieu of dividends, but only if you know or have reason to know that the payments are not qualified dividends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have an entry on line 2b(2), be sure you use Schedule D (Form 1041), the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, or the Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet, whichever applies, to figure the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax. Figuring the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax liability in this manner will usually result in a lower tax.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 3—Business Income or (Loss)\\nIf the estate operated a business, report the income and expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Profit or Loss From Business.

Also use Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) to report farm rental income and expenses based on crops or livestock produced by a tenant. Enter the net profit or (loss) from Schedule E on line 5. See the Instructions for Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for reporting requirements.\\nIf the estate or trust received a Schedule K-1 from a partnership, S corporation, or other flow-through entity, use the corresponding lines on Form 1041 to report the interest, dividends, capital gains, etc., from the flow-through entity.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 6—Farm Income or (Loss)\\nIf the estate or trust operated a farm, use Schedule F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Profit or Loss From Farming, to report farm income and expenses.

If you have a net section 965(a) inclusion for 2019, write “SEC 965” in the entry space and enter the net inclusion amount on line 8. The net 965(a) inclusion is figured by subtracting the 965(c) deduction (Form 965, Part II, line 17) from the 965(a) inclusion (Form 965, Part I, line 3). You must also complete and attach Form 965 and Form 965-A to your return. See the Instructions for Form 965 for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDeductions\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization\\nA trust or decedent\\'s estate is allowed a deduction for depreciation, depletion, and amortization only to the extent the deductions aren\\'t apportioned to the beneficiaries. An estate or trust isn\\'t allowed to make an election under section 179 to expense depreciable business assets.\\nThe estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of depreciation, depletion, and amortization is generally reported on the appropriate lines of Schedule C, E, or F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), the net income or loss from which is shown on lines 3, 5, or 6 of Form 1041. If the deduction isn\\'t related to a specific business or activity, then report it on line 15a.\\n\\nDepreciation.\\nFor a decedent\\'s estate, the depreciation deduction is apportioned between the estate and the heirs, legatees, and devisees on the basis of the estate\\'s income allocable to each.\\nFor a trust, the depreciation deduction is apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trust on the basis of the trust income allocable to each, unless the governing instrument (or local law) requires or permits the trustee to maintain a depreciation reserve. If the trustee is required to maintain a reserve, the deduction is first allocated to the trust, up to the amount of the reserve. Any excess is allocated among the income beneficiaries and the trust in the same manner as the trust\\'s accounting income. See Regulations section 1.167(h)-1(b).\\n\\n\\nDepletion.\\nFor mineral or timber property held by a decedent\\'s estate, the depletion deduction is apportioned between the estate and the heirs, legatees, and devisees on the basis of the estate\\'s income from such property allocable to each.\\nFor mineral or timber property held in trust, the depletion deduction is apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trust based on the trust income from such property allocable to each, unless the governing instrument (or local law) requires or permits the trustee to maintain a reserve for depletion. If the trustee is required to maintain a reserve, the deduction is first allocated to the trust, up to the amount of the reserve. Any excess is allocated among the beneficiaries and the trust in the same manner as the trust\\'s accounting income. See Regulations section 1.611-1(c)(4).\\n\\n\\nAmortization.\\nThe deduction for amortization is apportioned between an estate or trust and its beneficiaries under the same principles used to apportion the deductions for depreciation and depletion.\\nThe deduction for the amortization of reforestation expenditures under section 194 is allowed only to an estate.\\n\\n\\nAllocable share from a pass-through entity.\\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization received from a pass-through entity on a Schedule K-1 is apportioned and reported in the same manner as discussed above. A section 179 expense received from a pass-through entity on a Schedule K-1 isn\\'t deductible by the estate or trust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAllocation of Deductions for Tax-Exempt Income\\nGenerally, no deduction that would otherwise be allowable is allowed for any expense (whether for business or for the production of income) that is allocable to tax-exempt income. Examples of tax-exempt income include:\\n\\n\\n\\nCertain death benefits (section 101),\\n\\n\\nInterest on state or local bonds (section 103),\\n\\n\\nCompensation for injuries or sickness (section 104), and\\n\\n\\nIncome from discharge of indebtedness in a title 11 case (section 108).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nException.\\nState income taxes and business expenses that are allocable to tax-exempt interest are deductible.\\nExpenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt income are allocated only to tax-exempt income. A reasonable proportion of expenses indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt income and other income must be allocated to each class of income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDeductions That May Be Allowable for Estate Tax Purposes\\nAdministration expenses and casualty and theft losses deductible on Form 706 may be deducted, to the extent otherwise deductible for income tax purposes, on Form 1041 if the fiduciary files a statement waiving the right to deduct the expenses and losses on Form 706. The statement must be filed before the expiration of the statutory period of limitations for the tax year the deduction is claimed. See Pub. 559 for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAccrued Expenses\\nGenerally, an accrual basis taxpayer can deduct accrued expenses in the tax year that: (a) all events have occurred that determine the liability; and (b) the amount of the liability can be figured with reasonable accuracy. However, all the events that establish liability are treated as occurring only when economic performance takes place. There are exceptions for recurring items. See section 461(h).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLimitations on Deductions\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAt-Risk Loss Limitations\\nGenerally, the amount the estate or trust has \"at-risk\" limits the loss it can deduct for any tax year. Use Form 6198, At-Risk Limitations, to figure the deductible loss for the year and file it with Form 1041. For more information, see Pub. 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPassive Activity Loss and Credit Limitations\\n\\nIn general.\\nSection 469 and the regulations thereunder generally limit losses from passive activities to the amount of income derived from all passive activities. Similarly, credits from passive activities are generally limited to the tax attributable to such activities. These limitations are first applied at the estate or trust level.\\nGenerally, an activity is a passive activity if it involves the conduct of any trade or business, and the taxpayer does not materially participate in the activity. Passive activities don\\'t include working interests in oil and gas properties. See section 469(c)(3). \\n\\nNote.\\nMaterial participation standards for estates and trusts haven\\'t been established by regulations.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor a grantor trust, material participation is determined at the grantor level.\\nIf the estate or trust distributes an interest in a passive activity, the basis of the property immediately before the distribution is increased by the passive activity losses allocable to the interest, and such losses can\\'t be deducted. See section 469(j)(12).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLosses from passive activities are first subject to the at-risk rules. When the losses are deductible under the at-risk rules, the passive activity rules then apply.\\n\\n\\nRental activities.\\nGenerally, rental activities are passive activities, whether or not the taxpayer materially participates. However, certain taxpayers who materially participate in real property trades or businesses aren\\'t subject to the passive activity limitations on losses from rental real estate activities in which they materially participate. For more details, see section 469(c)(7).\\nFor tax years of an estate ending less than 2 years after the decedent\\'s date of death, up to $25,000 of deductions and deduction equivalents of credits from rental real estate activities in which the decedent actively participated are allowed. Any excess losses or credits are suspended for the year and carried forward.\\n\\n\\nPortfolio income.\\nPortfolio income isn\\'t treated as income from a passive activity, and passive losses and credits generally may not be applied to offset it. Portfolio income generally includes interest, dividends, royalties, and income from annuities. Portfolio income of an estate or trust must be accounted for separately.\\n\\n\\nForms to file.\\nSee Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations, to figure the amount of losses allowed from passive activities. See Form 8582-CR, Passive Activity Credit Limitations, to figure the amount of credit allowed for the current year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBusiness Interest\\nBusiness interest expense could be limited. For more information about limitations on deductions for business interest, see section 163(j) and Line 10-Interest, later.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTransactions Between Related Taxpayers\\nUnder section 267, a trust that uses the accrual method of accounting may only deduct business expenses and interest owed to a related party in the year the payment is included in the income of the related party. For this purpose, a related party includes:\\n\\n\\n\\nA grantor and a fiduciary of any trust;\\n\\n\\nA fiduciary of a trust and a fiduciary of another trust, if the same person is a grantor of both trusts;\\n\\n\\nA fiduciary of a trust and a beneficiary of such trust;\\n\\n\\nA fiduciary of a trust and a beneficiary of another trust, if the same person is a grantor of both trusts;\\n\\n\\nA fiduciary of a trust and a corporation more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the trust or by or for a person who is a grantor of the trust; and\\n\\n\\nAn executor of an estate and a beneficiary of that estate, except for a sale or exchange to satisfy a pecuniary bequest (that is, a bequest of a sum of money).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 10—Interest\\nEnter the amount of interest (subject to limitations) paid or incurred by the estate or trust on amounts borrowed by the estate or trust, or on debt acquired by the estate or trust (for example, outstanding obligations from the decedent) that isn\\'t claimed elsewhere on the return.\\nIf the proceeds of a loan were used for more than one purpose (for example, to purchase a portfolio investment and to acquire an interest in a passive activity), the fiduciary must make an interest allocation according to the rules in Temporary Regulations section 1.163-8T.\\nDon\\'t include interest paid on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations on which the interest is wholly exempt from income tax.\\nPersonal interest isn\\'t deductible. Examples of personal interest include interest paid on:\\n\\n\\n\\nRevolving charge accounts used to purchase personal use property;\\n\\n\\nPersonal notes for money borrowed from a bank, credit union, or other person;\\n\\n\\nInstallment loans on personal use property; and\\n\\n\\nUnderpayments of federal, state, or local income taxes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInterest that is paid or incurred on indebtedness allocable to a trade or business (including a rental activity) should be deducted on the appropriate line of Schedule C, E, or F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), the net income or loss from which is shown on line 3, 5, or 6 of Form 1041.\\nTypes of interest to include on line 10 are:\\n\\n\\n\\nAny investment interest (subject to limitations—see below);\\n\\n\\nAny qualified residence interest (see later); and\\n\\n\\nAny interest payable under section 6601 on any unpaid portion of the estate tax attributable to the value of a reversionary or remainder interest in property for the period during which an extension of time for payment of such tax is in effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nLimitation on deduction of business interest.\\nBusiness interest expense is limited to the sum of business interest income, 30% of the adjusted taxable income and floor plan financing interest. Business interest expense includes any interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to a trade or business. A taxpayer, other than a tax shelter, that meets the gross receipts test is not required to limit business interest expense under section 163(j). A taxpayer meets the gross receipts test if the taxpayer has average annual gross receipts of $26 million or less for the 3 prior tax years. Gross receipts include the aggregate gross receipts from all persons treated as a single employer such as a controlled group of corporations, commonly controlled partnerships or proprietorships, and affiliated service groups. If the taxpayer fails to meet the gross receipts test, Form 8990, Limitation on Business Interest Expense Under Section 163(j), is generally required. \\n\\n\\nInvestment interest.\\nGenerally, investment interest is interest (including amortizable bond premium on taxable bonds acquired after October 22, 1986, but before January 1, 1988) that is paid or incurred on indebtedness that is properly allocable to property held for investment. Investment interest doesn\\'t include any qualified residence interest, or interest that is taken into account under section 469 in figuring income or loss from a passive activity.\\nGenerally, net investment income is the excess of investment income over investment expenses. Investment expenses (other than interest) are deductible only to the extent they are allowable under section 67(e).\\nThe amount of the investment interest deduction may be limited. Use Form 4952, Investment Interest Expense Deduction, to figure the allowable investment interest deduction.\\nIf you must complete Form 4952, check the box on line 10 of Form 1041 and attach Form 4952. Then, add the deductible investment interest to the other types of deductible interest and enter the total on line 10.\\n\\n\\nQualified residence interest.\\nInterest paid or incurred by an estate or trust on indebtedness secured by a qualified residence of a beneficiary of an estate or trust is treated as qualified residence interest if the residence would be a qualified residence (that is, the principal residence or the secondary residence selected by the beneficiary) if owned by the beneficiary. The beneficiary must have a present interest in the estate or trust or an interest in the residuary of the estate or trust. See Pub. 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction, for an explanation of the general rules for deducting home mortgage interest.\\nSee section 163(h)(3) for a definition of qualified residence interest and for limitations on indebtedness.\\n\\n\\nQualified mortgage insurance premiums.\\nEnter (on the worksheet later) the qualified mortgage insurance premiums paid under a mortgage insurance contract issued after December 31, 2006, in connection with qualified residence acquisition debt that was secured by a principal or secondary residence. See Prepaid mortgage insurance below if the estate or trust paid any premiums allocable after 2019. If at least one other person was liable for and paid the premiums in connection with the loan, and the premiums were reported on Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, include the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of the 2019 premiums on the worksheet later. \\nQualified mortgage insurance is mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Housing Administration, or the Rural Housing Service (or their successor organizations), and private mortgage insurance (as defined in section 2 of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 as in effect on December 20, 2006).\\nMortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Rural Housing Service is commonly known as a funding fee and guarantee fee, respectively. These fees can be deducted fully in 2019 if the mortgage insurance contract was issued in 2019.

If the mortgage is satisfied before its term, no deduction is allowed for the unamortized balance. See Pub. 936 for details. These allocation rules do not apply to qualified mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Rural Housing Service (or their successor organizations).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLimit on the amount that is deductible.\\nThe estate or trust cannot deduct mortgage insurance premiums if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s AGI is more than $109,000. If the estate\\'s or trust\\'s AGI is more than $100,000, its deduction is limited and you must use the Qualified Mortgage Insurance Premiums Deduction Worksheet, above, to figure the deduction. See Adjusted gross income (AGI), earlier, for information on figuring AGI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 11—Taxes\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe deduction for state and local taxes is limited to $10,000. The limitation applies to the total of your state and local income taxes (or general sales taxes, if elected instead of income taxes), real estate taxes, and personal property taxes. The limitation does not apply to foreign income taxes, and state and local taxes paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business or for the production of income.\\nEnter any deductible taxes paid or incurred during the tax year that aren\\'t deductible elsewhere on Form 1041. Deductible taxes include the following:\\n\\n\\n\\nState and local income taxes. You can deduct state and local income taxes unless you elect to deduct state and local general sales taxes. You can\\'t deduct both.\\n\\n\\nState and local general sales taxes. You can elect to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes. Generally, you can elect to deduct the actual state and local general sales taxes (including compensating use taxes) you paid in 2019 if the tax rate was the same as the general sales tax rate. However, sales taxes on food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles are deductible as a general sales tax even if the tax rate was less than the general sales tax rate. Sales taxes on motor vehicles are also deductible as a general sales tax if the tax rate was more than the general sales tax rate, but the tax is deductible only up to the amount of tax that would have been imposed at the general sales tax rate. Motor vehicles include cars, motorcycles, motor homes, recreational vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, and off-road vehicles. Also include any state and local general sales taxes paid for a leased motor vehicle.\\nDo not include sales taxes paid on items used in a trade or business. An estate or trust cannot use the Optional Sales Tax Tables for individuals in the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Itemized Deductions, to figure its deduction.\\n\\n\\nState and local real property taxes.\\n\\nNote.\\nThe deduction for foreign real property taxes is no longer allowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nState and local personal property taxes.\\n\\n\\nForeign or U.S. possession income taxes.

However, expenses for preparing all other tax returns, including gift tax returns, are considered costs commonly and customarily incurred by individuals and are not deductible. For more information, see Notice 2018-61 and Regulations section 1.67-4.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 15a—Other Deductions\\nAttach your own statement, listing by type and amount all allowable deductions that aren\\'t deductible elsewhere on Form 1041.\\nAllowable deductions include all deductions listed in section 67(b) (including estate taxes attributable to IRD under section 691(c)), and other costs allowable under section 67(e) paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust that would not have been incurred if the property were not held in the estate or trust.\\nDon\\'t include any losses on worthless bonds and similar obligations and nonbusiness bad debts. Report these losses as applicable on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets.\\nDon\\'t deduct medical or funeral expenses on Form 1041. Medical expenses of the decedent paid by the estate may be deductible on the decedent\\'s income tax return for the year incurred. See section 213(c). Funeral expenses are deductible only on Form 706.\\n\\nOther costs paid or incurred by estates and non-grantor trusts.\\nUnder section 67(e), deductions are allowable for costs which are paid or incurred by an estate or non-grantor trust in connection with the administration of the estate or trust and would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate. \\nIn determining whether a cost is deductible by an estate or non-grantor trust it must be determined whether the cost would be “commonly or customarily” incurred by a hypothetical individual owning the same property. If the cost would be deductible by a hypothetical individual, it is not deductible by the estate or non-grantor trust.\\nIt is the type of product or service rendered to the estate or non-grantor trust in exchange for the cost, rather than the description of the cost of that product or service that is determinative.\\nCosts that are incurred commonly or customarily by individuals include costs incurred in defense of a claim against the estate, the decedent, or the non-grantor trust that are unrelated to the existence, validity, or administration of the estate or trust. These amounts are not allowable deductions. \\n\\n\\nOwnership costs.\\nOwnership costs are costs that are chargeable to or incurred by an owner of property simply by reason of being the owner of the property. These costs are commonly or customarily incurred by a hypothetical individual owner of such property and are not deductible by an estate or non-grantor trust. Under section 67(b), they include, but are not limited to, condominium fees, insurance premiums, maintenance and lawn services, automobile registration and insurance costs, and partnership costs deemed to be passed through to and reportable by a partner. Other expenses incurred merely by reason of the ownership of property may be fully deductible under other provisions of the Code.\\n\\n\\nAppraisal fees.\\nAppraisal fees incurred to determine the fair market value of assets as of the decedent\\'s date of death (or the alternate valuation date), to determine value for purposes of making distributions, or as otherwise required to properly prepare the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax returns, or a generation-skipping transfer tax return, are not incurred commonly or customarily by an individual and are deductible. The cost of appraisals for other purposes (for example, insurance) is commonly or customarily incurred by individuals and is not an allowable deduction.\\n\\n\\nInvestment advisory fees.\\nFees for investment advice, including any related services that would be provided to any individual investor as part of an investment advisory fee, are incurred commonly or customarily by a hypothetical individual investor and are not deductible. However, certain incremental costs of investment advice beyond the amount that normally would be charged to an individual investor are deductible.\\nAn incremental cost is a special, additional charge that is added solely because the investment advice is rendered to a trust or estate rather than to an individual, including balancing beyond the usual varying interests of current beneficiaries and remaindermen. The deductible portion of the investment advisory fees is limited to the amount of those fees, if any, that exceeds the fees normally charged to an individual investor. See Regulations section 1.67-4(b)(4).\\n\\n\\nBundled fees.\\nIf an estate or non-grantor trust pays a single fee, commission, or other expense, such as a fiduciary\\'s commission, attorney\\'s fee, or accountant\\'s fee for both costs that are incurred commonly or customarily by individuals and costs (other than a de minimis amount) that are not incurred commonly or customarily by individuals, then (except to the extent provided otherwise by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin) the single fee, commission, or other expense (bundled fee) must be allocated, between the costs that are incurred commonly or customarily by individuals, such costs not being deductible, and costs that are not incurred commonly or customarily by individuals, such costs being deductible.\\nThere is an exception to the allocation rule if a bundled fee is not computed on an hourly basis. In this situation, only the portion of that fee that is attributable to investment advice is not deductible. The remaining portion is deductible.\\nOut-of-pocket expenses billed to the estate or non-grantor trust are treated as separate from the bundled fee and are not subject to allocation.\\nEstates and non-grantor trusts cannot deduct payments made from the bundled fee to third parties if such payments would not have been deductible if they had been paid directly by the estate or non-grantor trust.\\nAny reasonable method may be used to allocate a bundled fee, including without limitation the allocation of a portion of a fiduciary commission that is a bundled fee to investment advice. For more information, see Regulations section 1.67-4(c)(4).\\nNote. The reasonable method standard does not apply to determine the portion of the bundled fee attributable to payments made to third parties for commonly or customarily incurred by an individual or to any other separately assessed expense commonly or customarily incurred by an individual, because those payments and expenses are readily identifiable without any discretion on the part of the fiduciary or return preparer.\\nFor more information, see Regulations 1.67-4.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nOther deductions reported on line 15a.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBond premium(s).\\nFor taxable bonds acquired before October 23, 1986, if the fiduciary elected to amortize the premium, report the amortization on this line. If you made the election to amortize the premium, the basis in the taxable bond must be reduced by the amount of amortization.\\nFor tax-exempt bonds, you can\\'t deduct the premium that is amortized. Although the premium can\\'t be deducted, you must amortize the tax-exempt bond by the amount of premium amortized.\\nFor more information, see section 171 and Pub. 550.\\nIf you claim a bond premium deduction for the estate or trust, figure the deduction on a separate sheet and attach it to Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\nCasualty and theft losses.\\nUse Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts, to figure any deductible casualty and theft losses.\\n\\n\\nEstate\\'s or trust\\'s share of amortization, depreciation, and depletion not claimed elsewhere.\\nIf you can\\'t deduct the estate\\'s or trust\\'s apportioned share of amortization, depreciation, and depletion as rent or royalty expenses on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), or as business or farm expenses on Schedule C, or F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), itemize the estate\\'s or trust\\'s apportioned share of the deductions on an attached sheet and include them on line 15a. \\n\\nNote.\\nDon\\'t report the beneficiary\\'s apportioned share of depreciation, depletion, and amortization on line 15a.

For an example of the computation, see Regulations section 1.691(c)-1 and Pub. 559.\\nIf any amount properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed by an estate or trust to a beneficiary consists of IRD received by the estate or trust, don\\'t include such amounts in determining the estate tax deduction for the estate or trust.

Don\\'t include the deductions claimed on lines 13, 18, and 21 when figuring the amount of the NOL.\\n \\nGenerally, an NOL can only be carried forward to subsequent years and cannot be carried back. The 2-year carryback period only applies to the portion of an NOL attributable to a farming loss. For more information, see Pub. 536, Net Operating Losses (NOLs) for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts. \\n \\nComplete Schedule A of Form 1045 to figure the amount of the NOL that is available for carryback or carryover. Use Form 1045 or file an amended return to apply for a refund based on an NOL carryback. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 1045, Application for Tentative Refund.\\n \\nOn the termination of the estate or trust, any unused NOL carryover that would be allowable to the estate or trust in a later tax year, but for the termination, is allowed to the beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate or trust. See the instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 11, codes D and E, later.\\n\\n\\nExcess deductions on termination.\\nIf the estate or trust has for its final year deductions (excluding the charitable deduction and exemption) in excess of its gross income, the excess is allowed as an itemized deduction to the beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate or trust. In general, an unused NOL carryover that is allowed to beneficiaries (as explained above) can\\'t also be treated as an excess deduction. However, if the final year of the estate or trust is also the last year of the NOL carryover period, the NOL carryover not absorbed in that tax year by the estate or trust is included as an excess deduction.

It isn\\'t necessary that the charitable organization be created or organized in the United States.\\nA pooled income fund or a section 4947(a)(1) nonexempt charitable trust  treated as a private foundation must attach a separate sheet to Form 1041 instead of using Schedule A of Form 1041 to figure the charitable deduction.\\n\\nAdditional return to be filed by trusts.\\nTrusts, other than split-interest trusts or nonexempt charitable trusts, that claim a charitable deduction also file Form 1041-A unless the trust is required to distribute currently to the beneficiaries all the income for the year determined under section 643(b) and related regulations.\\nPooled income funds and charitable lead trusts also file Form 5227. See Form 5227 for information about any exceptions.\\n\\n\\nElection to treat contributions as paid in the prior tax year.\\n\\nThe fiduciary of an estate or trust may elect to treat as paid during the tax year any amount of gross income received during that tax year or any prior tax year that was paid in the next tax year for a charitable purpose.\\n \\nFor example, if a calendar year estate or trust makes a qualified charitable contribution on February 7, 2020, from income earned in 2019 or prior, then the fiduciary can elect to treat the contribution as paid in 2019.\\n \\nTo make the election, the fiduciary must file a statement with Form 1041 for the tax year in which the contribution is treated as paid. This statement must include: \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe name and address of the fiduciary;\\n\\n\\nThe name of the estate or trust;\\n\\n\\nAn indication that the fiduciary is making an election under section 642(c)(1) for contributions treated as paid during such tax year;\\n\\n\\nThe name and address of each organization to which any such contribution is paid; and\\n\\n\\nThe amount of each contribution and date of actual payment or, if applicable, the total amount of contributions paid to each organization during the next tax year, to be treated as paid in the prior tax year.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\xa0\\n \\nThe election must be filed by the due date (including extensions) for Form 1041 for the next tax year. If the original return was filed on time, you may make the election on an amended return filed no later than 6 months after the due date of the return (excluding extensions).

Include amounts paid during the tax year from gross income received in a prior tax year, but only if no deduction was allowed for any prior tax year for these amounts.\\nEstates, and certain trusts, may claim a deduction for amounts permanently set aside for a charitable purpose from gross income. Such amounts must be permanently set aside during the tax year to be used exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the establishment, acquisition, maintenance, or operation of a public cemetery not operated for profit.\\nFor a trust to qualify, the trust may not be a simple trust, and the set aside amounts must be required by the terms of a trust instrument that was created on or before October 9, 1969.\\nFurther, the trust instrument must provide for an irrevocable remainder interest to be transferred to or for the use of an organization described in section 170(c); or the trust must have been created by a grantor who was at all times after October 9, 1969, under a mental disability to change the terms of the trust.\\nAlso, certain testamentary trusts that were established by a will that was executed on or before October 9, 1969, may qualify.

If the governing instrument specifically provides as to the source from which amounts are paid, permanently set aside, or to be used for charitable purposes, the specific provisions control. In all other cases, determine the amount of tax-exempt income allocable to charitable contributions by multiplying line 1 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total tax-exempt income of the estate or trust, and the denominator of which is the gross income of the estate or trust. Don\\'t include in the denominator any losses allocated to corpus.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nLine 4—Capital Gains for the Tax Year Allocated to Corpus and Paid or Permanently Set Aside for Charitable Purposes\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter the total of all capital gains for the tax year that are:\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocated to corpus, and\\n\\n\\nPaid or permanently set aside for charitable purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nLine 6—Section 1202 Exclusion Allocable to Capital Gains Paid or Permanently Set Aside for Charitable Purposes\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the exclusion of gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business (QSB) stock was claimed, enter the part of the gain included on Schedule A, lines 1 and 4, that was excluded under section 1202.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSchedule B—Income Distribution Deduction\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGeneral Instructions\\nIf the estate or trust was required to distribute income currently or if it paid, credited, or was required to distribute any other amounts to beneficiaries during the tax year, complete Schedule B to determine the estate\\'s or trust\\'s income distribution deduction.\\n\\nNote.\\nUse Schedule I (Form 1041) to compute the DNI and income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nPooled income funds.\\nDon\\'t complete Schedule B for these funds. Instead, attach a separate statement to support the computation of the income distribution deduction. See Pooled Income Funds, earlier, for more information.\\n\\n\\nSeparate share rule.\\n\\nIf a single trust or an estate has more than one beneficiary, and if different beneficiaries have substantially separate and independent shares, their shares are treated as separate trusts or estates for the sole purpose of determining the DNI allocable to the respective beneficiaries.\\n \\nIf the separate share rule applies, figure the DNI allocable to each beneficiary on a separate sheet and attach the sheet to this return. Any deduction or loss that is applicable solely to one separate share of the trust or estate isn\\'t available to any other share of the same trust or estate.\\n \\nFor more information, see section 663(c) and related regulations.\\n\\n\\nWithholding of tax on foreign persons.\\n\\nThe fiduciary may be liable for withholding tax on distributions to beneficiaries who are foreign persons.

However, if both line 4 and line 17 on page 1 of Form 1041 are losses, enter on line 1, Schedule B, the smaller of those losses. If line 4 is zero or a gain and line 17 is a loss, enter zero on line 1, Schedule B.\\nIf you are filing for a simple trust, subtract from adjusted total income any extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends included on page 1, line 2, and determined under the governing instrument and applicable local law to be allocable to corpus.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nLine 2—Adjusted Tax-Exempt Interest\\n\\n\\n\\nTo figure the adjusted tax-exempt interest:\\nStep 1. Add tax-exempt interest income on line 2 of Schedule A, any expenses allowable under section 212 allocable to tax-exempt interest, and any interest expense allocable to tax-exempt interest.\\nStep 2. Subtract the Step 1 total from the amount of tax-exempt interest (including exempt-interest dividends) received.\\nSection 212 expenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt interest are allocated only to tax-exempt interest. A reasonable proportion of section 212 expenses that are indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt interest and other income must be allocated to each class of income.\\nFigure the interest expense allocable to tax-exempt interest according to the guidelines in Rev.

The determination of whether trust income is required to be distributed currently depends on the terms of the governing instrument and the applicable local law.\\nThe line 9 distributions are referred to as first tier distributions and are deductible by the estate or trust to the extent of the DNI. The beneficiary includes such amounts in his or her income to the extent of his or her proportionate share of the DNI.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nLine 10—Other Amounts Paid, Credited, or Otherwise Required To Be Distributed\\n\\n\\n\\nLine 10 is to be completed only by a decedent\\'s estate or complex trust. These distributions consist of any other amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed and are referred to as second tier distributions. Such amounts include annuities to the extent not paid out of income, mandatory and discretionary distributions of corpus, and distributions of property in kind.\\nIf Form 1041-T was timely filed to elect to treat estimated tax payments as made by a beneficiary, the payments are treated as paid or credited to the beneficiary on the last day of the tax year and must be included on line 10.\\nUnless a section 643(e)(3) election is made, the value of all noncash property actually paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiaries is the smaller of:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estate\\'s or trust\\'s adjusted basis in the property immediately before distribution, plus any gain or minus any loss recognized by the estate or trust on the distribution (basis of beneficiary), or\\n\\n\\nThe FMV of such property.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a section 643(e)(3) election is made by the fiduciary, then the amount entered on line 10 will be the FMV of the property.\\nA fiduciary of a complex trust or a decedent\\'s estate may elect to treat any amount paid or credited to a beneficiary within 65 days following the close of the tax year as being paid or credited on the last day of that tax year. To make this election, see the instructions for Other Information, Question 6, later.\\nThe beneficiary includes the amounts on line 10 in his or her income only to the extent of his or her proportionate share of the DNI.\\n\\nComplex trusts.\\nIf the second tier distributions exceed the DNI allocable to the second tier, the trust may have an accumulation distribution.

Thus, for purposes of figuring the allowable income distribution deduction, the DNI (line 7) is figured without regard to any tax-exempt interest.\\nIf tax-exempt interest is the only tax-exempt income included in the total distributions (line 11), and the DNI (line 7) is less than or equal to line 11, then enter on line 12 the amount from line 2.\\nIf tax-exempt interest is the only tax-exempt income included in the total distributions (line 11), and the DNI is more than line 11 (that is, the estate or trust made a distribution that is less than the DNI), then figure the adjustment by multiplying line 2 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total distributions (line 11), and the denominator of which is the DNI (line 7). Enter the result on line 12.\\nIf line 11 includes tax-exempt income other than tax-exempt interest, figure line 12 by subtracting the total of the following from tax-exempt income included on line 11:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe charitable contribution deduction allocable to such tax-exempt income, and\\n\\n\\nExpenses allocable to tax-exempt income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt income are allocated only to tax-exempt income.

The election is made on Form 1041-T, Allocation of Estimated Tax Payments to Beneficiaries, which must be filed by the 65th day after the close of the trust\\'s tax year. Form 1041-T shows the amounts to be allocated to each beneficiary. This amount is reported on the beneficiary\\'s Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 13, code A.\\nAttach Form 1041-T to your return only if you haven\\'t yet filed it; however, attaching Form 1041-T to Form 1041 doesn\\'t extend the due date for filing Form 1041-T.

Attach Form 4136, Credit for Federal Tax Paid on Fuels. See Pub. 510, Excise Taxes, for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNet Investment Income Tax\\n\\nCertain estates and trusts may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). Estates and trusts use Form 8960 to report their Net Investment Income (NII) and calculate the tax. The amount of NIIT payable by the estate or trust is reported on Form 1041, Schedule G, line 5.\\nThe NIIT is imposed on estates and trusts to the extent that they have undistributed net investment income and adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeding $12,750. See Definitions, earler, for the calculation of an estate or trust’s AGI. The following types of estates and trusts may owe the NIIT in addition to their regular income tax liability:\\n\\n\\n\\nDecedent’s estates,\\n\\n\\nSimple and complex trusts,\\n\\n\\nElecting small business trusts (ESBTs),\\n\\n\\nPooled income funds, and\\n\\n\\nBankruptcy estates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHowever, in the case of bankruptcy estates, the adjusted gross income threshold is $125,000.\\n\\nCalculation of Net Investment Income.\\nIn general, an estate or trust’s NII is calculated in the same way as an individual. However, there are special rules for the calculation of NII in the case of an ESBT. See instructions to Form 8960 and Regulations section 1.1411-3(e) for information on the calculation (and Regulations section 1.1411-3(c)(1) for information on the ESBT calculation).\\n\\n\\nDistributions on Net Investment Income.\\nThe NIIT is imposed on estates and trusts to the extent it has undistributed net investment income. In order to arrive at the estate or trust’s undistributed net investment income, the estate or trust’s NII is reduced for (1) distributions of NII to beneficiaries, and (2) NII allocable to charities when the estate or trust is allowed a deduction under section 642(c). Instructions for Form 8960, line 18, provide more information on the calculation of undistributed net investment income.\\n\\n\\nNII allocable to the deduction under section 642(c).\\nAn estate, trust, or pooled income fund’s NII is reduced by the amount of NII allocable to the charitable deduction allowed under section 642(c). In the case of an estate, trust, or pooled income fund that has NII and non-NII income in a year when a section 642(c) deduction is claimed, the amount of the NII deduction allocable to the section 642(c) deduction will be less than the amount reported on Form 1041, Schedule A, line 7 (or on the separate calculation in the case of a pooled income fund).\\n\\n\\nBeneficiary reporting.\\nIn general, the amount of the income distribution deduction (from Form 1041, Schedule B, line 15) that reduces the estate or trust’s NII will be the amount of NII that will be taxable to the beneficiaries on their Schedules K-1 (Form 1041). \\nThe Schedule K-1 has a code H in box 14 to report the amount of net investment income distributed to the beneficiary. The amount reported in code H represents an adjustment (either positive or negative) that the beneficiary must use in completing its Form 8960 (if necessary). In the case where the trust’s income distribution deduction allowed in calculating undistributed net investment income is less than the amount on Schedule B, line 15, then code H will show a negative number that is the difference between the two amounts. In the case of an estate or trust that issues more than one Schedule K-1 for a year, the sum of the amounts reported in code H on all of the Schedules K-1 will be the difference between Schedule B, line 15, and the amount deducted on Form 8960, line 18b, for amounts of NII distributed to a beneficiary.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe beneficiary\\'s NII will equal all taxable amounts reported on the Schedule K-1, adjusted by the amount reported in box 14, code H.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe only instance where code H will be a positive number is when:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust owns directly, or indirectly, an (a) interest in a section 1291 fund, or (b) interest in a controlled foreign corporation or qualified electing fund and no election under Regulations section 1.1411–10(g) has been made with respect to that interest, and\\n\\n\\nThe distribution from one of the entities described above is (a) net investment income to the estate or trust, but not included in its taxable income, and (b) the distributions from the estate or trust to the beneficiary(s) in the year exceed the amount of the income distribution deduction allowed for regular tax purposes (from Schedule B, line 15).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSpecial rules.\\nIn the final year of an estate or trust, deductions in excess of income may be reported to the beneficiary on Schedule K-1, box 11. These deductions may also be deductible by the beneficiary for NIIT purposes. In this situation, the terminating estate or trust should provide the beneficiary information regarding whether the amounts reported in box 11, codes A through D, include any amounts that are deductible for NIIT purposes. See Regulations section 1.1411-4(g)(4). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOther Information\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 1\\nIf the estate or trust received tax-exempt income, figure the allocation of expenses between tax-exempt and taxable income on a separate sheet and attach it to the return. Enter only the deductible amounts on the return. Don\\'t figure the allocation on the return itself. For more information, see the instructions for Allocation of Deductions for Tax-Exempt Income, earlier.\\nReport the amount of tax-exempt interest income received or accrued in the space provided below Question 1.\\nAlso, include any exempt-interest dividends the estate or trust received as a shareholder in a mutual fund or other regulated investment company.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 2\\nAll salaries, wages, and other compensation for personal services must be included on the return of the person who earned the income, even if the income was irrevocably assigned to a trust by a contract assignment or similar arrangement.\\nThe grantor or person creating the trust is considered the owner if he or she keeps \"beneficial enjoyment\" of or substantial control over the trust property. The trust\\'s income, deductions, and credits are allocable to the owner.\\nIf you checked \"Yes\" for Question 2, see Special Reporting Instructions, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 3\\nCheck the \"Yes\" box and enter the name of the foreign country if either 1 or 2 below applies.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust owns more than 50% of the stock in any corporation that owns one or more foreign bank accounts.\\n\\n\\nAt any time during the year the estate or trust had an interest in or signature or other authority over a bank, securities, or other financial account in a foreign country.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nException. \\nCheck \"No\" if either of the following applies to the estate or trust: \\n\\n\\n\\nThe combined value of the accounts was $10,000 or less during the whole year, or\\n\\n\\nThe accounts were with a U.S. military banking facility operated by a U.S. financial institution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you checked \"Yes\" for Question 3, electronically file FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), with the Department of the Treasury using the FinCEN\\'s BSA E-Filing Sytem. Because FinCEN Form 114 isn\\'t a tax form, don\\'t file it with Form 1041.\\nSee fincen.gov for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are required to file FinCEN Form 114 but don\\'t, you may have to pay a penalty of up to $10,000 (or more in some cases).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 4\\nThe estate or trust may be required to file Form 3520, Annual Return To Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts, if:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt directly or indirectly transferred property or money to a foreign trust. For this purpose, any U.S. person who created a foreign trust is considered a transferor;\\n\\n\\nIt is treated as the owner of any part of the assets of a foreign trust under the grantor trust rules; or\\n\\n\\nIt received a distribution from a foreign trust.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAn owner of a foreign trust must ensure that the trust files an annual information return on Form 3520-A, Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a U.S. Owner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 5\\nAn estate or trust claiming an interest deduction for qualified residence interest (as defined in section 163(h)(3)) on seller-provided financing must include on an attachment to the 2019 Form 1041 the name, address, and TIN of the person to whom the interest was paid or accrued (that is, the seller).\\nIf the estate or trust received or accrued such interest, it must provide identical information on the person liable for such interest (that is, the buyer). This information doesn\\'t need to be reported if it duplicates information already reported on Form 1098.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 6\\nTo make the section 663(b) election to treat any amount paid or credited to a beneficiary within 65 days following the close of the tax year as being paid or credited on the last day of that tax year, check the box. This election can be made by the fiduciary of a complex trust or the executor of a decedent\\'s estate. For the election to be valid, you must file Form 1041 by the due date (including extensions). Once made, the election is irrevocable.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 7\\nTo make the section 643(e)(3) election to recognize gain on property distributed in kind, check the box and see the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 9\\nGenerally, a beneficiary is a skip person if the beneficiary is in a generation that is two or more generations below the generation of the transferor to the trust.\\nTo determine if a beneficiary that is a trust is a skip person, and for exceptions to the general rules, see the definition of a skip person in the instructions for Schedule R of Form 706.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 10\\nA domestic trust that is a specified domestic entity must file Form 8938 along with Form 1041 for the tax year. Form 8938 must be filed each year the value of the trust\\'s specified foreign financial assets meets or exceeds the reporting threshold. A trust exceeds the threshold amount if the total value of the specified foreign financial assets is more than $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or more than $75,000 at any time during the tax year. For more information on domestic trusts that are specified domestic entities, the filing threshold, and the types of foreign financial assets that must be reported, see the Instructions for Form 8938.\\nA domestic trust that is required to file Form 8938 along with Form 1041 for the tax year must check \"Yes\" to Question 10 under Other Information, Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 11a\\nA distribution of S corporation stock by an estate or trust that results in a change of ownership for federal income tax purposes is a triggering event described in Regulations section 1.965-7(c)(3). If the estate or trust transfers less than all of its shares of stock of the S corporation, the transfer will be a triggering event only with respect to the portion of the estate’s or trust’s section 965(i) net tax liability that is properly allocable to the transferred shares. If the person who received the distribution of S corporation stock is an eligible section 965(i) transferee, the estate or trust may enter into a transfer agreement with the eligible section 965(i) transferee to prevent the assessment of the estate’s or trust’s section 965(i) net tax liability in the tax year that includes the triggering event.\\nThe estate or trust must report in Part IV, column (g) of Form 965-A, Individual Report of Net 965 Tax Liability, the transfer out of the section 965 tax liability properly allocable to S corporation shares for which the estate or trust entered into a transfer agreement with an eligible section 965(i) transferee. See the instructions for Form 965-A for additional information.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe transfer agreement must be filed within 30 days of the triggering event. See Form 965-D, Transfer Agreement Under 965(i)(2), and the related instructions for additional information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 11b\\nIf the estate or trust distributed S corporation shares and the estate or trust did not enter into a timely transfer agreement for all shares transferred during the tax year, the transfer of shares not covered by a transfer agreement is a triggering event. See Triggering event under section 965(i), earlier.\\nThe estate or trust may file a consent agreement under section 965(i)(4)(D) to make the election under section 965(h) to pay in installments the triggered section 965(i) net tax liability. See Form 965-E, Consent Agreement Under Section 965(i)(4)(D), and the related instructions for how to file the consent agreement. See the instructions for Triggered deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, in Part I of the instructions for Form 965-A for how to make the installment election.\\nSee Line 25 — 2019 Net 965 Tax Liability Paid, and Schedule G, Part II, Line 15 — 2019 Net 965 Tax Liability – Eligible for Installment Payment Election, earlier, for how to report payments of the 965 tax.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe due date of the original Form 965-E is within 30 days of the triggering event.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe due date of the election to pay in installments is the due date of the return for the tax year, including extension. The actual payment of the first installment is due no later than the due date of the return for the tax year without extension, even if the election is made on a return filed by the extended due date.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 12\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNote:\\nCheck the “Yes” box if the estate or trust entered into a transfer agreement as an eligible 965(i) transferee.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe estate or trust must report on Form 965-A the net 965 tax liability with respect to an S corporation, whether or not deferred. If during the tax year the estate or trust entered into a transfer agreement as an eligible 965(i) transferee, the estate or trust must report the transfer in of that liability on Part IV of Form 965-A. See the instructions for Form 965-A for additional information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 13\\nIf the deemed owner of a grantor portion of the ESBT is a nonresident alien, the items of income, deduction, and credit from that grantor portion must be reallocated to the S portion. See Schedule G, Part I, line 4, Tax on the ESBT Portion of the Trust, earlier for how to figure the tax on the S portion of the trust.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 14\\nThe S portion of the ESBT must take into account the qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss and other items from any S corporation owned by the ESBT, and any qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss and other items reallocated to the S portion. See Question 13, earlier. For purposes of determining whether the taxable income of an ESBT exceeds the threshold amount, the S portion and the non-S portion of an ESBT are treated as a single trust. See Regulations section 1.199A-6(d)(3)(vi).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSchedule J (Form 1041) — Accumulation Distribution for Certain Complex Trusts\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGeneral Instructions\\nUse Schedule J (Form 1041) to report an accumulation distribution for a domestic complex trust that was:\\n\\n\\n\\nPreviously treated at any time as a foreign trust (unless an exception is provided in future regulations), or\\n\\n\\nCreated before March 1, 1984, unless that trust would not be aggregated with other trusts under the rules of section 643(f) if that section applied to the trust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAn accumulation distribution is the excess of amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed (other than income required to be distributed currently) over the DNI of the trust reduced by income required to be distributed currently.

See sections 665 and 667(c) for exceptions relating to multiple trusts. The trustee reports to the IRS the total amount of the accumulation distribution before any reduction for income accumulated before the beneficiary reaches age 21. If the multiple trust rules don\\'t apply, the beneficiary claims the exclusion when filing Form 4970, as you may not be aware that the beneficiary may be a beneficiary of other trusts with other trustees.\\nFor examples of accumulation distributions that include payments from one trust to another trust, and amounts distributed for a dependent\\'s support, see Regulations section 1.665(b)-1A(b).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart II—Ordinary Income Accumulation Distribution\\nEnter the applicable year at the top of each column for each throwback year.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nLine 6—DNI for Earlier Years\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter the applicable amounts as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThrowback year(s)\\n\\xa0\\nAmount from line\\n\\n\\n1969–1977\\nForm 1041, Schedule C, line 5\\n\\n\\n1978–1979\\nForm 1041, line 61\\n\\n\\n1980\\nForm 1041, line 60\\n\\n\\n1981–1982\\nForm 1041, line 58\\n\\n\\n1983–1996\\nForm 1041, Schedule B, line 9\\n\\n\\n1997–2018\\nForm 1041, Schedule B, line 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor information about throwback years, see the instructions for line 13.

An accumulation distribution is thrown back first to the earliest preceding tax year in which there is undistributed net income (UNI). Then, it is thrown back beginning with the next earliest year to any remaining preceding tax years of the trust. The portion of the accumulation distribution allocated to the earliest preceding tax year is the amount of the UNI for that year. The portion of the accumulation distribution allocated to any remaining preceding tax year is the amount by which the accumulation distribution is larger than the total of the UNI for all earlier preceding tax years.\\nA tax year of a trust during which the trust was a simple trust for the entire year isn\\'t a preceding tax year unless (a) during that year the trust received outside income, or (b) the trustee didn\\'t distribute all of the trust\\'s income that was required to be distributed currently for that year. In this case, UNI for that year must not be more than the greater of the outside income or income not distributed during that year.\\nThe term \"outside income\"  means amounts that are included in the DNI of the trust for that year but that aren\\'t \"income\" of the trust as defined in Regulations section 1.643(b)-1.

If more than 5 throwback years are involved, use another Schedule J, completing Parts II and III for each additional throwback year.\\nIf the beneficiary is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, see section 667(e) about retaining the character of the amounts distributed to determine the amount of the U.S. withholding tax.\\nThe beneficiary uses Form 4970 to figure the tax on the distribution. The beneficiary also uses Form 4970 for the section 667(b)(6) tax adjustment if an accumulation distribution is subject to estate or generation-skipping transfer tax. This is because the trustee can\\'t be the estate or generation-skipping transfer tax return filer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSchedule K-1 (Form 1041)— Beneficiary\\'s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGeneral Instructions\\nUse Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) to report the beneficiary\\'s share of income, deductions, and credits from a trust or a decedent\\'s estate.\\n\\nNote.\\nSection 67(g) suspends miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor for tax years 2018 through 2025. See  Notice 2018-61 for information about allowable beneficiary deductions under section 67(e) and 642(h).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGrantor type trusts don\\'t use Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) to report the income, deductions, or credits of the grantor (or other person treated as owner). See Grantor Type Trusts, earlier.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWho Must File\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fiduciary (or one of the joint fiduciaries) must file Schedule K-1. A copy of each beneficiary\\'s Schedule K-1 is attached to the Form 1041 filed with the IRS, and each beneficiary is given a copy of his or her respective Schedule K-1. One copy of each Schedule K-1 must be retained for the fiduciary\\'s records.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBeneficiary\\'s Identifying Number\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a payer of income, you are required to request and provide a proper identifying number for each recipient of income. Enter the beneficiary\\'s number on the respective Schedule K-1 when you file Form 1041. Individuals and business recipients are responsible for giving you their TINs upon request. You may use Form W-9 to request the beneficiary\\'s identifying number.\\n\\nPenalty.\\n\\nYou may be charged a $50 penalty for each failure to provide a required TIN, unless reasonable cause is established for not providing it. Explain any reasonable cause in a signed affidavit and attach it to this return.\\n\\n\\nTruncating recipient\\'s identification number on beneficiary\\'s statement.\\nThe estate or trust can truncate a beneficiary’s identifying number on the Schedule K-1 the estate or trust sends to the beneficiary. Truncation isn\\'t allowed on the Schedule K-1 the estate or trust files with the IRS. Also, the estate or trust can\\'t truncate its own identification number on any form.\\nTo truncate, where allowed, replace the first five digits of the nine-digit number with asterisks (*) or Xs (for example, a SSN xxx-xx-xxxx would appear as ***-**-xxxx or XXX-XX-xxxx). For more information, see Regulations section 301.6109-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSubstitute Forms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t need IRS approval to use a substitute Schedule K-1 if it is an exact copy of the IRS schedule. The boxes must use the same numbers and titles and must be in the same order and format as on the comparable IRS Schedule K-1. The substitute schedule must include the OMB number and the 6-digit form ID code in the upper right-hand corner of the schedule.\\nYou must provide each beneficiary with the Instructions for Beneficiary Filing Form 1040 or 1040-SR or other prepared specific instructions for each item reported on the beneficiary\\'s Schedule K-1.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nInclusion of Amounts in Beneficiaries\\' Income\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSimple trust.\\n\\nThe beneficiary of a simple trust must include in his or her gross income the amount of the income required to be distributed currently, whether or not distributed, or if the income required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries exceeds the DNI, his or her proportionate share of the DNI. The determination of whether trust income is required to be distributed currently depends on the terms of the trust instrument and applicable local law. See Regulations section 1.652(c)-4 for a comprehensive example.\\n\\n\\nEstates and complex trusts.\\n\\nThe beneficiary of a decedent\\'s estate or complex trust must include in his or her gross income the sum of: \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe amount of the income required to be distributed currently, or if the income required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries exceeds the DNI (figured without taking into account the charitable deduction), his or her proportionate share of the DNI (as so figured), and\\n\\n\\nAll other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed, or if the sum of the income required to be distributed currently and other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to all beneficiaries exceeds the DNI, his or her proportionate share of the excess of DNI over the income required to be distributed currently.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\xa0\\n \\nSee Regulations section 1.662(c)-4 for a comprehensive example.\\n \\nFor complex trusts that have more than one beneficiary, and if different beneficiaries have substantially separate and independent shares, their shares are treated as separate trusts for the sole purpose of determining the amount of DNI allocable to the respective beneficiaries. A similar rule applies to treat substantially separate and independent shares of different beneficiaries of an estate as separate estates. For examples of the application of the separate share rule, see the regulations under section 663(c).\\n\\n\\nGifts and bequests.\\nDon\\'t include in the beneficiary\\'s income any gifts or bequests of a specific sum of money or of specific property under the terms of the governing instrument that are paid or credited in three installments or less.\\nAmounts that can be paid or credited only from income of the estate or trust don\\'t qualify as a gift or bequest of a specific sum of money.\\n\\n\\nPast years.\\nDon\\'t include in the beneficiary\\'s income any amounts deducted on Form 1041 for an earlier year that were credited or required to be distributed in that earlier year.\\n\\n\\nCharacter of income.\\nThe beneficiary\\'s income is considered to have the same proportion of each class of items entering into the computation of DNI that the total of each class has to the DNI (for example, half dividends and half interest if the income of the estate or trust is half dividends and half interest).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAllocation of deductions.\\nGenerally, items of deduction that enter into the computation of DNI are allocated among the items of income to the extent such allocation isn\\'t inconsistent with the rules set out in section 469 and its regulations, relating to passive activity loss limitations, in the following order.\\nFirst, all deductions directly attributable to a specific class of income are deducted from that income. For example, rental expenses, to the extent allowable, are deducted from rental income.\\nSecond, deductions that aren\\'t directly attributable to a specific class of income generally may be allocated to any class of income, as long as a reasonable portion is allocated to any tax-exempt income. Deductions considered not directly attributable to a specific class of income under this rule include fiduciary fees, and state income and personal property taxes. The charitable deduction, however, must be ratably apportioned among each class of income included in DNI.\\nFinally, any excess deductions that are directly attributable to a class of income may be allocated to another class of income. However, in no case can excess deductions from a passive activity be allocated to income from a nonpassive activity, or to portfolio income earned by the estate or trust. Excess deductions attributable to tax-exempt income can\\'t offset any other class of income.\\nIn no case can deductions be allocated to an item of income that isn\\'t included in the computation of DNI, or attributable to corpus.\\nYou can\\'t show any negative amounts for any class of income shown in boxes 1 through 8 of Schedule K-1. However, for the final year of the estate or trust, certain deductions or losses can be passed through to the beneficiary(ies). See the instructions for box 11 for more information on these deductions and losses. Also, the beneficiary\\'s share of depreciation and depletion is apportioned separately. These deductions may be allocated to the beneficiary(ies) in amounts greater than his or her income. See Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization, earlier, and Rev. Rul. 74-530, 1974-2 C.B. 188.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBeneficiary\\'s Tax Year\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beneficiary\\'s income from the estate or trust must be included in the beneficiary\\'s tax year during which the tax year of the estate or trust ends. See Pub. 559 for more information, including the effect of the death of a beneficiary during the tax year of the estate or trust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGeneral Reporting Information\\nIf the return is for a fiscal year or a short tax year, fill in the tax year space at the top of each Schedule K-1. On each Schedule K-1, enter the information about the estate or trust and the beneficiary in Parts I and II (items A through H). In Part III, enter the beneficiary\\'s share of each item of income, deduction, credit, and any other information the beneficiary needs to file his or her income tax return.\\n\\nCodes.\\nIn box 9 and boxes 11 through 14, identify each item by entering a code in the column to the left of the entry space for the dollar amount. These codes are identified in these instructions and on the back of the Schedule K-1.\\n\\n\\nAttached statements.\\nEnter an asterisk (*) after the code, if any, in the column to the left of the dollar amount entry space for each item for which you have attached a statement providing additional information. For those informational items that can\\'t be reported as a single dollar amount, enter the code and asterisk in the left-hand column and enter \"STMT\" in the entry space to the right to indicate that the information is provided on an attached statement. More than one attached statement can be placed on the same sheet of paper and should be identified in alphanumeric order by box number followed by the letter code (if any). For example: \"Box 9, Code A—Depreciation\" (followed by the information the beneficiary needs).\\n\\n\\nToo few entry spaces on Schedule K-1?\\nIf the estate or trust has more coded items than the number of spaces in box 9 or boxes 11 through 14, don\\'t enter a code or dollar amount in the last entry space of the box. In the last entry space, enter an asterisk in the left column and enter \"STMT\" in the entry space to the right. Report the additional items on an attached statement and provide the box number, code, description, and dollar amount or information for each additional item. For example: \"Box 13, Code H—Biofuel Producer Credit, $500.00.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSpecific Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart I.

Don\\'t enter a loss in box 3. If, for the final year of the estate or trust, there is a capital loss carryover, enter in box 11, code B, the beneficiary\\'s share of short-term capital loss carryover. However, if the beneficiary is a corporation, enter in box 11, code B, the beneficiary\\'s share of all short- and long-term capital loss carryovers as a single item. See section 642(h) and related regulations for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBoxes 4a through 4c—Net Long-Term Capital Gain\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter the beneficiary\\'s share of the net long-term capital gain from Schedule D (Form 1041), lines 18a through 18c, column (1), minus allocable deductions.\\nDon\\'t enter a loss in boxes 4a through 4c. If, for the final year of the estate or trust, there is a capital loss carryover, enter in box 11, code C, the beneficiary\\'s share of the long-term capital loss carryover. (If the beneficiary is a corporation, see the instructions for box 3.) See section 642(h) and related regulations for more information.\\nGains or losses from the complete or partial disposition of a rental, rental real estate, or trade or business activity that is a passive activity must be shown on an attachment to Schedule K-1.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 5—Other Portfolio and Nonbusiness Income\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter the beneficiary\\'s share of annuities, royalties, or any other income, minus allocable deductions (other than directly apportionable deductions), that isn\\'t subject to any passive activity loss limitation rules at the beneficiary level. Use boxes 6 through 8 to report income items subject to the passive activity rules at the beneficiary\\'s level.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBoxes 6 through 8—Ordinary Business Income, Rental Real Estate, and Other Rental Income\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter the beneficiary\\'s share of trade or business, rental real estate, and other rental income, minus allocable deductions (other than directly apportionable deductions). To assist the beneficiary in figuring any applicable passive activity loss limitations, also attach a separate schedule showing the beneficiary\\'s share of income derived from each trade or business, rental real estate, and other rental activity.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 9—Directly Apportioned Deductions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe limitations on passive activity losses and credits under section 469 apply to estates and trusts. Estates and trusts that distribute income to beneficiaries are allowed to apportion depreciation, depletion, and amortization deductions to the beneficiaries. These deductions are referred to as \"directly apportionable deductions.\"\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRules for treating a beneficiary\\'s income and directly apportionable deductions from an estate or trust and other rules for applying the passive loss and credit limitations to beneficiaries of estates and trusts haven\\'t yet been issued.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAny directly apportionable deduction, such as depreciation, is treated by the beneficiary as having been incurred in the same activity as incurred by the estate or trust. However, the character of such deduction may be determined as if the beneficiary incurred the deduction directly.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTo assist the beneficiary in figuring any applicable passive activity loss limitations, also attach a separate schedule showing the beneficiary\\'s share of directly apportionable deductions derived from each trade or business, rental real estate, and other rental activity.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEnter the beneficiary\\'s share of directly apportioned deductions using codes A through C.\\n\\n\\n\\nDepreciation (code A).\\nEnter the beneficiary\\'s share of the depreciation deductions directly apportioned to each activity reported in boxes 5 through 8. See the instructions under Deductions, earlier, for a discussion of how the depreciation deduction is apportioned between the beneficiaries and the estate or trust. Report any AMT adjustment or tax preference item attributable to depreciation separately in box 12, using code G. \\n\\nNote.\\nAn estate or trust can\\'t make an election under section 179 to expense certain depreciable business assets.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDepletion (code B).\\nEnter the beneficiary\\'s share of the depletion deduction under section 611 directly apportioned to each activity reported in boxes 5 through 8. See Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization, earlier, for a discussion of how the depletion deduction is apportioned between the beneficiaries and the estate or trust. Report any tax preference item attributable to depletion separately in box 12, using code H.\\n\\n\\nAmortization (code C).\\nItemize the beneficiary\\'s share of the amortization deductions directly apportioned to each activity reported in boxes 5 through 8. Apportion the amortization deductions between the estate or trust and the beneficiaries in the same way that the depreciation and depletion deductions are divided. Report any AMT adjustment attributable to amortization separately in box 12, using code I.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 10—Estate Tax Deduction (Including Certain Generation-Skipping Transfer Taxes)\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the distribution deduction consists of any IRD, and the estate or trust was allowed a deduction under section 691(c) for the estate tax paid attributable to such income (see the line 19 instructions), then the beneficiary is allowed an estate tax deduction in proportion to his or her share of the distribution that consists of such income. For an example of the computation, see Regulations section 1.691(c)-2. Figure the computation on a separate sheet and attach it to the return.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 11, Code A—Excess Deductions on Termination\\n\\n\\n\\nIf this is the final return of the estate or trust, and there are excess deductions on termination (see the instructions for line 23), enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the excess deductions in box 11, using code A. Figure the deductions on a separate sheet and attach it to the return.\\nExcess deductions on termination occur only during the last tax year of the trust or decedent\\'s estate when the total deductions (excluding the charitable deduction and exemption) are greater than the gross income during that tax year.\\nGenerally, a deduction based on an NOL carryover isn\\'t available to a beneficiary as an excess deduction. However, if the last tax year of the estate or trust is also the last year in which an NOL carryover may be taken (see section 172(b)), the NOL carryover is considered an excess deduction on the termination of the estate or trust to the extent it isn\\'t absorbed by the estate or trust during its final tax year. For more information, see Regulations section 1.642(h)-4 for a discussion of the allocation of the carryover among the beneficiaries.\\nOnly the beneficiary of an estate or trust that succeeds to its property is allowed to deduct that entity\\'s excess deductions on termination. A beneficiary who doesn\\'t have enough income in that year to absorb the entire deduction can\\'t carry the balance over to any succeeding year. An individual beneficiary must be able to itemize deductions in order to claim the excess deductions in determining taxable income.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 11, Codes B and C—Unused Capital Loss Carryover\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon termination of the trust or decedent\\'s estate, the beneficiary succeeding to the property is allowed as a deduction any unused capital loss carryover under section 1212.

See Net Investment Income Tax, earlier, for more information on these amounts.\\n\\n\\nSection 199A information (code I).\\nIn the case of a trust or estate, the qualified business income (QBI) deduction, also known as the section 199A deduction, is determined at the beneficiary level for the portions of QBI, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership items apportioned to the beneficiaries. To allow beneficiaries to correctly figure their QBI deduction, the trust or estate must enter an asterisk (*) on each beneficiary’s Schedule K-1 next to code I and enter “STMT” in the right column to indicate that the information is provided on an attached statement. Do not add amounts into a single number and report it on Schedule K-1. The information must be separately identified for each trade or business the trust or estate directly conducts, including specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs). The trust or estate must attach the statement to each Schedule K-1, separately identifying the beneficiary’s allocable share of:\\n\\n\\n\\nQualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss;\\n\\n\\nW-2 wages;\\n\\n\\nUnadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property;\\n\\n\\nQualified PTP items; and \\n\\n\\nSection 199A dividends, also known as qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trust or estate must make an initial determination of which items are qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss at its level and report to each beneficiary their share of all items that may be qualified items at the beneficiary level. See the heading Determining the Trust or Estate’s QBI or Qualified PTP Income, below. The beneficiary must then determine whether each item is includible in QBI.\\n\\nIn addition, the trust or estate must also report on whether any of its trades or businesses are SSTBs and identify on the statement any trades or businesses that are aggregated.\\n\\nTrusts and estates should use Statement A—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting, in these instructions, or a substantially similar statement, to report each beneficiary’s allocable information from each trade or business, including QBI items, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified PTP items, and section 199A dividends by attaching the completed statement(s) to each beneficiary’s Schedule K-1. The trust or estate should also use Statement A—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting to report each beneficiary’s share of QBI items, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified PTP items, and section 199A dividends reported to the trust or estate by another entity.\\n\\nNote.\\nThe estate or trust must report each beneficiary\\'s share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction and loss from a PTP. The PTP component is not limited by the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property limitations. Therefore, neither the PTP nor its owners (including estates and trusts) is required to report W-2 wages or UBIA of qualified property amounts related to a trade or business operated by a PTP.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrusts and estates should use Statement B—QBI Pass-through Entity Aggregation Election(s), in these instructions, or a substantially similar statement, to report aggregated trades or businesses and provide supporting information to beneficiaries on each Schedule K-1.\\n\\nTrusts and estates should use Statement C—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting- Patrons of Specified Agricultural and Horticultural Cooperatives, in these instructions, or a substantially similar statement, to report allocable QBI and W-2 wages allocable to qualified payments from a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative for each trade or business. This statement should also be used to report each beneficiary’s allocable section 199A(g) deduction reported to the trust or estate by the specified cooperative. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDetermining the trust or estate’s qualified trades or businesses.\\nThe trust or estate’s qualified trades or businesses include its section 162 trades or businesses, except for specified service trades or businesses, or the trade or business of providing services as an employee. A section 162 trade or business generally includes any activity carried on to make a profit and with considerable, regular, and continuous activity. For more information on what qualifies as a trade or business for purposes of section 199A, see the Instructions for Form 8995, Qualified Business Income Deduction Simplified Computation, or Form 8995-A, Qualified Business Income Deduction.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRental real estate.\\nRental real estate may constitute a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction if the rental real estate:\\n\\n\\n\\nRises to the level of a trade or business under section 162,\\n\\n\\nSatisfies the requirements for the rental real estate safe harbor in Rev. Proc. 2019-38, 2019-42 I.R.B. 942, or\\n\\n\\nMeets the self-rental exception (that is, the rental or licensing of property to a commonly controlled trade or business conducted by an individual or relevant passthrough entity (RPE)) in Regulations section 1.199A-1(b)(14).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe determination of whether rental real estate constitutes a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction is made by the trust or estate. The trust or estate must first make this determination and then only include the allocable share of rental real estate items of income, gain, loss, and deduction on the statement provided to beneficiaries. Rental real estate that does not meet one of the three conditions noted above does not constitute a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction and must not be included in the QBI information provided to beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSpecified service trades or businesses excluded from qualified trades or businesses.\\nSSTBs are generally excluded from the definition of a qualified trade or business. An SSTB is any trade or business providing services in the fields of health, law, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, investing and investment management, trading or dealing in securities, trust or estate interests, or commodities or any other trade or business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners. The term any trade or business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners means any trade or business that consists of any of the following: (i) a trade or business in which a person receives fees, compensation, or other income for endorsing products or services; (ii) a trade or business in which a person licenses or receives fees, compensation, or other income for the use of an individual’s image, likeness, name, signature, voice, trademark, or any other symbols associated with the individual’s identity; or (iii) receiving fees, compensation, or other income for appearing at an event or on radio, television, or another media format.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nException.\\nIf the beneficiary’s taxable income is equal to or less than the threshold for the reporting 2019 tax year, $160,700 ($321,400 if married filing jointly or $160,725 if married filing separately or married nonresident alien), the QBI from the SSTB may be used by the beneficiary to compute their QBI deduction. If the beneficiary’s taxable income is within the phase-in range, the threshold amount plus $50,000 ($100,000 if married filing jointly), an applicable percentage of the QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property from an SSTB may be used by the beneficiary to compute their QBI deduction. Therefore, the statement attached to the Schedule K-1 issued to each beneficiary must identify any items relating to SSTBs.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAggregation.\\nA trust or estate engaged in more than one trade or business may choose to aggregate multiple trades or businesses into a single trade or business for purposes of section 199A if it meets the following requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe same person, or group of persons, either directly or through attribution, owns 50% or more of each trade or business for a majority of the tax year, including the last day of the tax year, and all trades or businesses use the same tax year-end;\\n\\n\\nNone of the trades or businesses are an SSTB; and\\n\\n\\nThe trades or businesses to be aggregated meet at least two of the following three factors:\\n\\n\\n\\nThey provide products, property, or services that are the same or that are customarily offered together;\\n\\n\\nThey share facilities or share significant centralized business elements, such as personnel, accounting, legal, manufacturing, purchasing, human resources, or information technology resources; or\\n\\n\\nThey are operated in coordination with, or reliance upon, one or more of the businesses in the aggregated group.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the trust or estate chooses to aggregate multiple trades or businesses, it must report the aggregation on Statement B, or a substantially similar statement, and attach it to each Schedule K-1. The statement must provide the information necessary to identify each separate trade or business included in each aggregation, a description of the aggregated trades or businesses, and an explanation of the factors met that allow the aggregation in accordance with Regulations section 1.199A-4. The aggregation statement must be completed each year to show the trust or estate\\'s trade or business aggregations. Failure to disclose the aggregations may cause them to be disaggregated.\\n\\nThe trust or estate\\'s aggregations must be reported consistently for all subsequent years, unless there is a change in facts and circumstances that changes or disqualifies the aggregation. The trust or estate must provide a written explanation for any changes to prior year aggregations that describes the change in facts and circumstances.\\n\\nIf the trust or estate directly or indirectly owns an interest in a relevant RPE that aggregates multiple trades or businesses, it must attach a copy of the RPE’s aggregation to each Schedule K-1. The trust or estate cannot break apart the aggregation of another RPE, but it may add trades or businesses to the aggregation, assuming the requirements above are satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDetermining the Trust or Estate’s QBI or Qualified PTP Items.\\nThe trust or estate’s items of QBI that must be reported to beneficiaries include the allocated amounts of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from the trust or estate’s trades or businesses that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. This may include, but is not limited to, items such as ordinary business income or (losses), section 1231 gains or (losses), charitable contributions, section 179 deductions, and interest from debt financed distributions.\\n\\nQBI may also include rental income (losses) or royalty income, if the activity rises to the level of a trade or business; and gambling gains or (losses), but only if the trust or estate is engaged in the trade or business of gambling. Whether an activity rises to the level of a trade or business must be determined at the entity level and, once made, is binding on beneficiaries.\\n\\nQualified PTP items that must be reported to the beneficiaries include the allocated amounts of the trust or estate’s share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a PTP and may also include gain or loss recognized on the disposition of the trust or estate’s partnership interest that is not treated as a capital gain or loss.\\n\\nHowever, QBI and qualified PTP items don’t include any of the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nItems that are treated as capital gain or loss under any provision of the Code.\\n\\n\\nDividends or dividend equivalents, including qualified REIT dividends.\\n\\n\\nInterest income (unless received in connection with the trade or business).\\n\\n\\nWage income.\\n\\n\\nIncome that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (for more information, go to IRS.gov and type in the key word “effectively connected income”).\\n\\n\\nCommodities transactions, or foreign currency gains or losses described in section 954(c)(1)(C) or (D).\\n\\n\\nIncome, loss, or deductions from notional principal contracts under section 954(c)(1)(F).\\n\\n\\nAnnuities (unless received in connection with the trade or business).\\n\\n\\nGuaranteed payments described in section 707(c) received by the entity for services rendered to a partnership.\\n\\n\\nPayments described in section 707(a) received by the entity for services rendered to a partnership.\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQBI flowchart.\\nTrusts or estates may use the flow chart below to help them determine if an allocated item of income, gain, deduction, or loss is includible in QBI reportable to beneficiaries.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQBI Flowchart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions\\nYes\\nNo\\n\\n\\nIs the item effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States?\\nContinue\\nStop, this item isn’t QBI.\\n\\n\\nIs the item attributable to a trade or business (this may include section 1231 gain (loss), charitable contributions, section 179 deductions, interest from debt financed distributions, etc.)? Examples of an item not considered attributable to the trade or business at the entity level include gambling income (loss) where the entity isn’t engaged in trade or business of gambling, income (loss) from vacation properties when the entity isn’t in that trade or business, activities not engaged in for profit, etc.\\nContinue\\nStop, this item isn’t QBI.\\n\\n\\nIs the item treated as a capital gain or loss under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or is it a dividend or dividend equivalent?\\nStop, this item isn’t QBI.\\nContinue\\n\\n\\nIs the item interest income other than interest income properly allocable to a trade or business? (Note that interest income attributable to an investment of working capital, reserves, or similar accounts isn’t properly allocable to a trade or business).\\nStop, this item isn’t QBI.\\nContinue\\n\\n\\nIs the item an annuity, other than an annuity received in connection with the trade or business?\\nStop, this item isn’t QBI.\\nContinue\\n\\n\\nIs the item gain or loss from a commodities transaction or foreign currency gain or loss described in sections 954(c)(1)(C) or (D)?\\nStop, this item isn’t QBI.\\nContinue\\n\\n\\nIs the item gain or loss from a notional principal contract under section 954(c)(1)(F)?\\nStop, this item isn’t QBI.\\nContinue\\n\\n\\nIs the item of income or loss from a qualified publicly traded partnership?\\nThis item is a qualified PTP item. Report this item as qualified PTP income or loss, subject to beneficiary-specific determinations, and check the PTP box.\\nThis item is QBI. Report this item as QBI subject to beneficiary-specific determinations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions for Statement A—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQBI or qualified PTP items.\\nThe trust or estate must first determine if it is engaged in one or more trades or businesses. It must then determine if any of its trades or businesses are SSTBs. The trust or estate must also determine whether it has qualified PTP items from an interest in a PTP. The trust or estate must indicate the status on the appropriate check boxes for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) or PTP interest reported.\\n\\nNote.\\nSSTBs and PTPs cannot be aggregated with any other trade or business. So, if the aggregation box is checked, the SSTB and PTP boxes for that specific aggregated trade or business should not be checked.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, the trust or estate must report to each beneficiary their allocable share of all apportioned items that are QBI or qualified PTP items for each trade or business the trust or estate owns directly or indirectly. Use the QBI Flow Chart above to determine if an allocated item is reportable as a QBI item or qualified PTP item subject to beneficiary-specific determinations. Each item included under “Other” must be stated separately, identifying the nature and amount of each item.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nW-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property.\\nThe trust or estate must determine the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property properly allocable to QBI for each qualified trade or business and report the allocable share to each beneficiary on Statement A, or a substantially similar statement, attached to Schedule K-1. This includes the allocable share of W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property reported to the trust or estate from any qualified trades or businesses of an RPE the trust or estate owns directly or indirectly. However, trusts or estates that own a direct or indirect interest in a PTP may not include any amounts for W-2 wages or UBIA of qualified property from the PTP, as the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property from a PTP are not allowed in computing the W-2 wage and UBIA limitations.\\n\\nThe W-2 wages are amounts paid to employees described in section 6051(a)(3) and (8). If the trust or estate conducts more than one trade or businesses, it must allocate the W-2 wages among its trades or businesses. See Rev. Proc. 2019-11, 2019-09 I.R.B. 742 or more information.\\n\\nThe unadjusted basis of qualified property is figured by adding the unadjusted basis of all qualified assets immediately after acquisition. Qualified property includes all tangible property subject to depreciation under section 167 for which the depreciable period hasn\\'t ended that is held and used for the production of QBI by the trade or business during the tax year and held on the last day of the tax year. The depreciable period ends on the later of 10 years after the property is placed in service or the last day of the full year for the applicable recovery period under section 168.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSection 199A dividends.\\nThe trust or estate must report the apportioned allocable share of any REIT dividends to each beneficiary on Statement A, or a substantially similar statement, attached to Schedule K-1. Section 199A dividends do not have to be reported by trade or business and can be reported as a single amount to beneficiaries. Section 199A dividends include dividends the trust or estate receives from a REIT held for more than 45 days, for which the payment is not obligated to someone else, is not a capital gain dividend under section 857(b)(3) and is not a qualified dividend under section 1(h)(11), plus any apportioned qualified REIT dividends received from a regulated investment company (RIC).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFiscal year trusts and estates.\\nFor purposes of determining the QBI or qualified PTP items, UBIA of qualified property, and the aggregate amount of qualified section 199A dividends, fiscal year trusts or estates include all items from the fiscal tax year.\\n\\nFor purposes of determining W-2 wages, fiscal year trusts or estates include apportioned amounts paid to employees under section 6051(a)(3) and (8) for the calendar year ended with or within the trust or estate’s tax year. If the trust or estate conducts more than one trade or business, it must allocate W-2 wages among its trades or businesses. See Rev. Proc. 2019-11 for more information.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNote.\\nThe trust or estate must report each beneficiary’s share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction and loss from a PTP, but the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property from the PTP should not be reported as the beneficiary cannot use that information in computing their QBI deduction.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nStatement A—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPass-through entity’s name:\\nPass-through entity’s EIN:\\n\\n\\nBeneficiary’s name:\\nBenificiary’s identifying number:\\n\\n\\nBeneficiary\\'s Share of:\\n❑ PTP\\n\\t\\t\\t❑ Aggregated\\n\\t\\t\\t❑ SSTB\\n❑ PTP\\n\\t\\t\\t❑ Aggregated\\n\\t\\t\\t❑ SSTB\\n❑ PTP\\n\\t\\t\\t❑ Aggregated\\n\\t\\t\\t❑ SSTB\\n\\n\\nQBI or Qualified PTP Items Subject to Beneficiary-specific Determinations\\nTB1\\nTB2\\nTB3\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOrdinary business income\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nRental income\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOther\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nW-2 Wages\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUBIA of Qualified Property\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSection 199A Dividends\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions for Statement B—QBI Pass-through Entity Aggregation Election(s).\\nIf the trust or estate elects to aggregate more than one trade or business that meet all the requirements to aggregate, the trust or estate must report the aggregation to beneficiaries on Statement B, or a substantially similar statement, and attach it to each Schedule K-1. The trust or estate must indicate trades or businesses that were aggregated by checking the appropriate box for each aggregated trade or business. The trust or estate must also provide a description of the aggregated trade or business and an explanation of the factors met that allow the aggregation.\\n\\nThe aggregation statement must be completed each year to show the trust’s or estate’s trade or business aggregations. Failure to disclose the aggregations may cause them to be disaggregated. The trust’s or estate’s aggregations must be reported consistently for all subsequent years, unless there is a change in facts and circumstances that changes or disqualifies the aggregation. The trust or estate must provide a written explanation for any changes to prior year aggregations that describes the change in facts and circumstances.\\n\\nIf the trust or estate holds a direct or indirect interest in an RPE that aggregates multiple trades or businesses, the trust or estate must also include a copy of the RPE’s aggregations with each beneficiary’s Schedule K-1.

The estate or trust must determine if any of its beneficiaries are required to disclose the transaction and provide those beneficiaries with information they will need to file Form 8886. This determination is based on the category(ies) under which a transaction qualified for disclosure. See the Instructions for Form 8886 for details.\\nIn addition, if the beneficiary is a \"covered person\" in connection with a foreign tax credit splitter arrangement under section 909, attach a statement that identifies the arrangement including the foreign taxes paid or accrued.\\n\\n\\nSection 199 Domestic production activities deduction (DPAD).\\nIf the estate or trust is a recipient of the DPAD from a pass-through entity (partnership, S corporation, estate, trust, or cooperative) with a tax year beginning before 2018, the DPAD can be taken in limited circumstances. See Form 8903 and its instructions for details.\\n\\n\\nInclusion of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI).\\nSection 951A requires U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations to report their ratable share of GILTI in taxable income. If applicable, provide the information necessary to figure the GILTI inclusion to each beneficiary. See the Instructions for Form 8992 for details.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForeign-derived intangible income (FDII).\\nPublic Law 115-97 enacted section 250, which allows a domestic corporation a deduction for the eligible percentage of FDII and GILTI. Section 250 is effective for tax years beginning after 2017. If applicable, provide the necessary information to each domestic corporate beneficiary for its calculation of FDII benefit. See section 250 for more information. See the Instructions for Form 8993 for details.\\n\\n\\n\\nLimitation on business interest expense.\\nIf an estate or trust is required to file Form 8990, the adjusted taxable income of an estate or trust beneficiary is reduced by any income (including any distributable net income) received from the estate or trust by the beneficiary to the extent such income supported a deduction for business interest expense under section 163(j)(1)(B) in computing the estate\\'s or trust\\'s taxable income. If applicable, provide the beneficiary the necessary information to calculate this amount in an attachment to Schedule K-1.

This one-time election is made by filing Form 1041-N in the first tax year of the trust. Form 1041-N is used to report an ANST\\'s income, deductions, gains, losses, etc., and to figure and pay any income tax due. Form 1041-N is also used to report special information applicable to an ANST\\'s filing requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDefinitions\\nAn ANST is a settlement trust within the meaning of section 3(t) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).\\nAn Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) has the same meaning as the term \"Native Corporation\" has under section 3(m) of the ANCSA.\\nA sponsoring ANC means the ANC that transfers assets to an electing ANST.\\nA trustee is a fiduciary of the trust. Any reference in these instructions to \"you\" means the trustee of the trust.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTax Treatment of an Electing ANST\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\\n\\nFigure the AGI of an electing ANST by subtracting from total income (line 5) administrative costs (lines 7 through 9) and the exemption amount (line 11). Administrative costs are deductible to the extent they would not have been incurred if the property were not held by the ANST.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTaxable Income\\nIn general, an electing ANST\\'s taxable income is figured in the same manner as any other taxable trust (see Internal Revenue Code subchapter J). However, the electing ANST isn\\'t allowed to take an income distribution deduction, though it can claim an exemption deduction, the amount of which depends on the terms of the trust.\\nSee the Schedule K instructions for information on the beneficiaries\\' tax treatment of distributions received from the ANST.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIncome Assignment From a Native Corporation\\n\\nThe ANST reports income assignments from an ANC on the appropriate income line consistent with the type of income assigned to the ANST. See Part III—Other Information, Question 1, later, for the information required to be attached to the form.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTax\\nAn electing ANST pays tax on its taxable income at the lowest rate specified for single individuals (10%). If the ANST has net capital gain or qualified dividends, use the tax computation on Part IV of Schedule D, which applies a 0% rate on its adjusted net capital gain.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDisqualifying Acts\\nIf, at any time, a beneficial interest in an ANST may be disposed of to a person in a manner that isn\\'t permitted by section 7(h) of the ANCSA (if the interest were settlement common stock), then:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf no election has previously been made, the ANST can\\'t elect special tax treatment under section 646 for the trust and its beneficiaries; or\\n\\n\\nIf the election is in effect at that time:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe election won\\'t apply as of the first day of the tax year in which a prohibited disposition is first allowed;\\n\\n\\nThe section 646 tax treatment won\\'t apply to the trust for that tax year or in any subsequent tax years; and\\n\\n\\nThe distributable net income of the trust will be increased by the current or accumulated earnings and profits of the sponsoring ANC as of the close of the tax year, after adjustment is made for all distributions made by the sponsoring ANC during the tax year. However, this increase is limited to the fair market value (FMV) of the trust\\'s assets as of the date the beneficial interest of the trust first becomes disposable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf stock in the sponsoring ANC may be disposed of to a person in a manner that isn\\'t allowed by section 7(h) of the ANCSA (if the stock were settlement common stock) and at any time after such disposition of stock is first allowed, the corporation transfers assets to an ANST, then items 1, 2, and 3 above will apply to the ANST in the same manner as if the ANST allowed dispositions of beneficial interests in the ANST in a manner not allowed by section 7(h) of the ANCSA.\\nThe surrender of an interest in an ANC or an electing ANST by the shareholder or beneficiary, for a whole or partial redemption or for the whole or partial liquidation of the corporation or trust, will be considered a transfer allowed by section 7(h) of the ANCSA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInformation Reporting Requirements\\nElecting ANSTs must complete Schedule K and file it with Form 1041-N. The ANST must also provide a copy of Schedule K to the sponsoring ANC by the date Form 1041-N is required to be filed with the IRS. The ANST isn\\'t required to provide information to the beneficiaries on distributions made to them. The sponsoring ANC will provide the beneficiaries with any required information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must File\\nThe trustee of any electing ANST having any taxable income, or having gross income of at least $600 for the tax year, must file Form 1041-N for that year.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMaking the Election\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe trustee of an ANST must make this election by the due date (including extensions) for filing the ANST\\'s tax return for its first tax year.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe trustee makes the election for the ANST by signing Form 1041-N in the signature block on page 1. The return must be filed by the due date (including extensions) for filing the ANST\\'s tax return for its first tax year. Once the election is made, it applies to all subsequent years and can\\'t be revoked.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen To File\\nANSTs file Form 1041-N by the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the tax year. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, file on the next business day.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPrivate Delivery Services\\nYou can use certain private delivery services (PDSs) designated by the IRS to meet the \"timely mailing as timely filing\" rule for tax returns. Go to IRS.gov/PDS for the current list of designated services.\\nThe PDS can tell you how to get written proof of the mailing date.\\nFor the IRS mailing address to use if you’re using a PDS, go to IRS.gov/PDSStreetAddresses.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPDSs can\\'t deliver items to P.O. boxes. You must use the U.S. Postal Service to mail any item to an IRS P.O. box address.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExtension of Time To File\\nUse Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns, to request an automatic extension of time to file.\\nAn extension of time to file doesn\\'t extend the time to pay the tax.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhere To File\\nFile Form 1041-N at the following address.\\n\\xa0\\nDepartment of the Treasury\\nInternal Revenue Service\\nOgden, UT 84201-0027\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must Sign\\nThe trustee or an authorized representative must sign Form 1041-N.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPaid Preparer\\nGenerally, anyone who is paid to prepare a tax return must sign the return and provide the information requested in the Paid Preparer Use Only area of the return. The person required to sign the return must:\\n\\n\\n\\nComplete the required preparer information;\\n\\n\\nSign it in the space provided for the preparer\\'s signature; and\\n\\n\\nGive you a copy of the return for your records, in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPaid Preparer Authorization\\nIf the trustee wants to allow the IRS to discuss the ANST\\'s tax return with the paid preparer who signed it, check the \"Yes\" box in the signature area of the return. This authorization applies only to the individual whose signature appears in the Paid Preparer Use Only section of the ANST\\'s return. It doesn\\'t apply to the firm, if any, shown in that section.\\nIf the \"Yes\" box is checked, the trustee is authorizing the IRS to call the paid preparer to answer any questions that may arise during the processing of the ANST\\'s return. The trustee is also authorizing the paid preparer to:\\n\\n\\n\\nGive the IRS any information that is missing from the ANST\\'s return;\\n\\n\\nCall the IRS for information about the processing of the ANST\\'s return or the status of its refund or payment(s); and\\n\\n\\nRespond to certain IRS notices that the trustee has shared with the preparer about math errors, offsets, and return preparation. The notices won\\'t be sent to the preparer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe trustee isn\\'t authorizing the paid preparer to receive any refund, enter into any agreement (including those regarding additional tax liability), or otherwise represent the ANST before the IRS. If the trustee wants to expand the paid preparer\\'s authorization, see Pub. 947, Practice Before the IRS and Power of Attorney.\\nThe authorization can\\'t be revoked. However, the authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (regardless of extensions) for filing the ANST\\'s next tax return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAccounting Methods\\nFigure taxable income using the method of accounting regularly used in keeping the ANST\\'s books and records. Generally, permissible methods include the cash method, the accrual method, or any other method authorized by the Internal Revenue Code. In all cases, the method used must clearly reflect income.\\nGenerally, the ANST may change its accounting method (overall method or for any material item) only by getting consent on Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method. For more information, see Pub. 538, Accounting Periods and Methods.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAccounting Periods\\nAll electing ANSTs must adopt a calendar year.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRounding Off to Whole Dollars\\nYou may round off cents to whole dollars on the ANST\\'s return and schedules. If you do round to whole dollars, you must round all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50\\nbecomes $3.\\nIf you have to add two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEstimated Tax\\nGenerally, an ANST must pay estimated income tax if it expects to owe at least $1,000 after subtracting withholding and credits. For details and exceptions, see Form 1041-ES, Estimated Income Tax for Estates and Trusts.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInterest and Penalties\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInterest\\nInterest is charged on taxes not paid by the due date, even if an extension of time to file is granted. Interest is also charged on the failure-to-file penalty, the accuracy-related penalty, and the fraud penalty. The interest charge is figured at a rate determined under section 6621.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLate Filing of Return\\nSection 6651 provides for penalties for late filing unless there is a reasonable cause for the delay. The law also provides for penalties for willful attempts to evade payment of tax. The penalty won\\'t be imposed if you can show that the failure to file on time is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.\\nIf you receive a notice about penalty and interest after you file this return, send us an explanation, and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don\\'t attach an explanation when you file Form 1041-N. For more information about penalties for late filing, see Late Filing of Return in the Instructions for Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLate Payment of Tax\\nSection 6651 also provides for penalties for late payment. Generally, the penalty for not paying the tax when due is 1/2 of 1% of the unpaid amount for each month or part of a month it remains unpaid. The maximum penalty is 25% of the unpaid amount. The penalty is imposed on the net amount due. Any penalty is in addition to interest charges on late payments.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you include interest or either of these penalties with your payment, identify and enter these amounts in the bottom margin of Form 1041-N. Don’t include the interest or penalty amount in the balance of tax due on line 18.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUnderpaid Estimated Tax\\nIf the trustee underpaid estimated tax, use Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, to figure any penalty due. Enter the amount of the penalty in the bottom margin of Form 1041-N.

These include the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nDividends received on any share of stock that the ANST held for less than 61 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the purchaser of a stock isn\\'t entitled to receive the next dividend payment. When counting the number of days the ANST held the stock, include the day you disposed of the stock but not the day you acquired it.\\n\\n\\nDividends attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days that the ANST received on any share of preferred stock held for less than 91 days during the 181-day period that began 90 days before the ex-dividend date.

Include on this line income recognized on the early disposition of noncash property for which the ANST previously made a section 247(g) election. See also Part III—Other Information, Question 1, later, for additional information that may need to be attached to the return. Include on this line the ordinary income recognized on the disposition of property for which the ANST made a section 247(g) election. Report on Schedule D (Form 1041-N) the capital gain recognized on such disposition. See Section 247(g) Election Property in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041-N) for additional information.\\nIf the ANST is reporting global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), include it on the attached statement.

A reasonable proportion of expenses indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt income and other income must be allocated to each class of income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nLimitations on Deductions\\n\\n\\n\\nGenerally, the amount an ANST has \"at-risk\" limits the loss it can deduct in any tax year. Also, section 469 and its regulations generally limit losses from passive activities to the amount of income derived from all passive activities. Similarly, credits from passive activities are generally limited to the tax attributable to such activities.\\nFor details on these and other limitations on deductions, see Deductions in the Instructions for Form 1041.\\nMiscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor will not be allowed for tax years 2018 through 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nLine 9—Other Deductions\\n\\n\\n\\nAttach a schedule listing by type and amount all allowable deductions that aren\\'t deductible elsewhere on the form. No deduction is allowed for distributions to beneficiaries.\\nAn ANST may elect under section 965(n) to determine the amount of the net operating loss (NOL) for a tax year determined under section 172 and the amount of taxable income to be reduced by NOL carryovers or carrybacks to such tax year without regard to certain amounts under section 172. The amount not taken into consideration (the reduction amount) is generally equal to the amount of the section 965(a) inclusion (net of the section 965(c) deduction). If, as a result of an election under section 965(n), the amount of the NOL for the tax year is adjusted, the reduction amount is included in other income on line 4. If, as a result of an election under section 965(n), the taxable income reduced by NOL carryovers or carrybacks is reduced, the NOL deduction on line 4 is reduced by the reduction amount. See section 965(n) and the regulations thereunder for more information.\\nIn determining whether an expense is deductible it must be determined whether the expense would be \"commonly or customarily\" incurred by a hypothetical individual owning the same property. A cost incurred by an ANST is an allowable deduction to the extent that it is excluded from the definition of miscellaneous itemized deductions under section 67(b) and commonly or customarily would not be incurred by a hypothetical individual holding the same property.\\nInclude in line 9 the deduction for qualified business income.

The increase in tax due to the inclusion of the deferred income, which is the base amount for the computation of the additional 10% tax shown on this line, should be included on line 14. If the amended return also shows changes to income, deductions, or credits unrelated to the inclusion of the deferred income, attach a schedule showing the computation of the additional tax due only to the inclusion of the deferred income.

Use the trade dates for the date of acquisition and sale of stocks and bonds traded on an exchange or over-the-counter market.\\nFor property received by the ANST from an ANC for which the ANC made an election under section 247(e)(1), the ANST\\'s holding period includes the period the ANC held the property.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSection 643(e)(3) Election\\n\\n\\n\\nFor in-kind noncash property distributions, a fiduciary may elect to have the ANST recognize gain or loss in the same manner as if the distributed property had been sold to the beneficiary at its FMV. If the election is made, the beneficiary\\'s basis of such property is its FMV. This election applies to all distributions made by the ANST during the tax year and, once made, may be revoked only with IRS consent.\\n\\nNote.\\nSection 267 doesn\\'t allow an ANST to claim a deduction for any loss on property to which a section 643(e)(3) election applies.

However, if the FMV of the property at the time it was transferred to the trust is less than the transferor\\'s basis, then the FMV is used for determining any loss on disposition.\\nFor property received by the ANST from an ANC for which the ANC made an election under section 247(e)(1), the ANST\\'s basis in the property is the lesser of the adjusted basis of the ANC in the property immediately before the contribution, or the FMV of the property immediately before the contribution.\\nIf the property was transferred to the ANST and a gift tax was paid under chapter 12, then increase the donor\\'s basis as follows: multiply the amount of the gift tax paid by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net appreciation in value of the gift (defined below), and the denominator of which is the amount of the gift. For this purpose, the net appreciation in value of the gift is the amount by which the FMV of the gift exceeds the donor\\'s adjusted basis. Then, add the result to the donor\\'s basis.\\n\\nAdjustments to basis.\\nBefore figuring any gain or loss on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property owned by the ANST, adjustments to the property\\'s basis may be required.

This amount is generally the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture). However, if you chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount you chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale.

If the ANST recognized less than all of the realized gain, the partnership will be treated as having transferred only a proportionate amount of each section 1250 property. \\n\\n\\nLine 12.\\nAn example of an amount to include on line 12 is unrecaptured section 1250 gain from the sale of a vacation home previously used as a rental property but converted to personal use prior to the sale.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInstallment sales.\\nTo figure the amount to include on line 12, follow the steps below for each installment sale of property held more than 1 year for which you didn’t make an entry in Part I of Form 4797 for the year of sale.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStep 1.\\nFigure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable, or (b) the total gain for the sale. This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of the 2019 Form 4797 (or comparable lines of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStep 2.\\nReduce the amount figured in Step 1 by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable line of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain that must be allocated to the installment payments received from the sale.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStep 3.\\nGenerally, the amount of capital gain on each installment payment is treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain until the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain figured in Step 2 has been used in full. Figure the amount of gain treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for installment payments received during the tax year as the smaller of (a) the amount from line 26 or line 37 of the 2019 Form 6252 (or comparable lines for the current tax year), whichever applies; or (b) the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported. This amount is generally the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture). However, if you chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount you chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale. Include this amount on line 12.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOther sales or dispositions of section 1250 property.\\nFor each sale of property held more than 1 year (for which an entry wasn\\'t made in Part I of Form 4797), figure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable, or (b) the total gain for the sale. This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of Form 4797 (for 2019, or the comparable line for the current tax year) for that property. Next, reduce that amount by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of Form 4797 (for 2019, or the comparable line for the current tax year) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale.

However, if the fair market value (FMV) of the property at the time it was transferred to the trust is less than the transferor\\'s basis, then the FMV is used to determine any loss upon disposition.\\nIf the property was transferred to the trust after 1976, and a gift tax was paid under Chapter 12, then increase the donor\\'s basis as follows:\\nMultiply the amount of the gift tax paid by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net appreciation in value of the gift (defined below), and the denominator of which is the amount of the gift. For this purpose, the net appreciation in value of the gift is the amount by which the FMV of the gift exceeds the donor\\'s adjusted basis.\\n\\n\\nBasis of decedent\\'s estate property.\\nGenerally, the basis of property acquired by a decedent\\'s estate is the FMV of the property at the date of the decedent\\'s death, or the alternate valuation date if the executor elected to use an alternate valuation under section 2032.\\nSee Pub. 551 and the Instructions for Form 706 for a discussion of the valuation of qualified real property under section 2032A.\\n\\n\\nConsistent basis reporting between estate and person acquiring property from a decedent.\\nSection 2004 of Public Law 114-41 has two major requirements.\\n1. An executor of an estate (or other person) required to file an estate tax return after July 31, 2015, must provide a Form 8971 with attached Schedules A to the IRS, and a copy of the beneficiary’s Schedule A to each beneficiary who receives or is to receive property from the estate. The Schedule A must show the final estate tax value of the property received or to be received by the beneficiary. An executor (or other person) who files an estate tax return only to make an election regarding the generation-skipping transfer tax or portability of the deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) may not be required to provide Form 8971 and Schedule A.\\n2. If Part 2, column C of the Schedule A received by the beneficiary indicates that the property increases the estate tax liability, the beneficiary must use a basis consistent with the final estate tax value of the property to determine the beneficiary’s basis in that property. Calculate a basis consistent with the final estate tax value by starting with the reported value and then making any allowed adjustments.\\nFor more information, see the  Instructions for Form 8971 and Schedule A and Column (e)—Cost or Other Basis in the  Instructions for Form 8949.\\n\\n\\nBasis of property acquired from a decedent who died in 2010.\\nSee Pub. 4895, Tax Treatment of Property Acquired From a Decedent Dying in 2010, for details about determining the basis of property acquired from a decedent who died in 2010.\\n\\n\\nBasis of assets held on January 1, 2001, where an election to recognize gain was made.\\nIf you elected on behalf of an estate or trust to recognize gain on an asset held on January 1, 2001, the basis in the asset is its closing market price or FMV, whichever applies, on the date of the deemed sale and reacquisition, whether the deemed sale resulted in a gain or an unallowed loss.\\n\\n\\nCarryover basis.\\nCarryover basis determined under repealed section 1023 applies to property acquired from a decedent who died after December 31, 1976, and before November 7, 1978, only if the executor made a timely filed election on Form 5970-A, Election of Carryover Basis.\\n\\n\\nProperty received from an Alaska Native Corporation.\\nThe basis of property received by an Alaska Native Settlement Trust from an Alaska Native Corporation is the lesser of the basis of the Native Corporation in the property or the FMV immediately before the contribution of the property to the trust. The basis and FMV of the property are shown on the statement provided by the Native Corporation to the Settlement Trust. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCapital Asset\\n\\nEach item of property held by the estate or trust (whether or not connected with a trade or business) is a capital asset, except the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nStock in trade, inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers.\\n\\n\\nDepreciable or real property used in a trade or business, even if it\\'s fully depreciated.\\n\\n\\nCertain patents, inventions, models, or designs (whether or not patented); secret formulas or processes; or similar property. See section 1221(a)(3).\\n\\n\\nCopyrights; literary, musical, or artistic compositions; letters or memoranda; or similar property eligible for copyright protection that the trust received from someone whose personal efforts created them or for whom they were created in a way (such as by gift) that entitled the trust to the basis of the previous owner. In the case of letters, memoranda, or similar property, such property may also be prepared or produced for the trust.\\nNote. Under section 1221(b)(3), the trust can elect to treat musical compositions and copyrights in musical works as capital assets if it acquired the assets under circumstances entitling it to the basis of the person who created the property or for whom it was prepared or produced.\\n\\n\\nAccounts or notes receivable acquired in the ordinary course of a trade or business for services rendered or from the sale of inventoriable assets or property held primarily for sale to customers.\\n\\n\\nCertain U.S. Government publications not purchased at the public sale price.\\n\\n\\nCertain \"commodities derivative financial instruments\" held by a dealer (see section 1221(a)(6)).\\n\\n\\nCertain hedging transactions entered into in the normal course of a trade or business (see section 1221(a)(7)).\\n\\n\\nSupplies regularly used in a trade or business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nShort-Term or Long-Term\\n\\nSeparate the capital gains and losses according to how long the estate or trust held or owned the property. The holding period for short-term capital gains and losses is generally 1 year or less. The holding period for long-term capital gains and losses is generally more than 1 year. Property acquired from a decedent is treated as held for more than 1 year.\\nTo figure the length of the period the estate or trust held property, begin counting on the day after the estate or trust acquired the property and include the day it was disposed. Use the trade dates for the dates of acquisition and sale of stocks and bonds traded on an exchange or over-the-counter market.\\nThe holding period for property received by an Alaska Native Settlement Trust from an Alaska Native Corporation includes the period the Native Corporation held the property. The date the Native Corporation acquired the property is shown on the statement provided by the Native Corporation to the Settlement Trust.\\nBeginning in 2018, the long-term holding period for certain gains with respect to “applicable partnership interests” is more than 3 years. See Pub. 541 for more information.\\nFor more information about holding periods, see the Instructions for Form 8949.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSection 643(e)(3) Election\\n\\nFor in-kind noncash property distributions, a fiduciary may elect to have the estate or trust recognize gain or loss in the same manner as if the distributed property had been sold to the beneficiary at its FMV. The distribution deduction is the property\\'s FMV. This election applies to all distributions made by the estate or trust during the tax year. Once the election is made, it may only be revoked with IRS consent.\\n\\nNote.\\nSection 267 doesn\\'t allow a trust or a decedent\\'s estate to claim a deduction for any loss on property to which a section 643(e)(3) election applies. In addition, when a trust or a decedent\\'s estate distributes depreciable property, section 1239 applies to deny capital gains treatment for any gain on property to which a section 643(e)(3) election applies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRelated Persons\\nA trust can\\'t deduct a loss from the sale or exchange of property directly or indirectly between any of the following:\\n\\n\\n\\nA grantor and a fiduciary of a trust,\\n\\n\\nA fiduciary of a trust and a fiduciary (or beneficiary) of another trust created by the same grantor,\\n\\n\\nA fiduciary and a beneficiary of the same trust,\\n\\n\\nA trust fiduciary and a corporation of which more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock is owned directly or indirectly by or for the trust or by or for the grantor of the trust, or\\n\\n\\nAn executor of an estate and a beneficiary of that estate, except when the sale or exchange is to satisfy a pecuniary bequest (that is, a bequest of a sum of money).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nItems for Special Treatment\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBonds and other debt instruments.

See the Instructions for Form 8949 for detailed information about how to report the disposition of a market discount bond.\\n\\n\\nGain or loss recognized on the disposition of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to the noncontingent bond method. The gain is generally treated as interest income rather than as capital gain. In certain situations, all or a portion of a loss recognized on the disposition of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to the noncontingent bond method may be treated as an ordinary loss rather than as a capital loss. See Regulations section 1.1275-4(b) and Pub. 550 for more information on contingent payment debt instruments subject to the noncontingent bond method.\\n\\n\\nA nonbusiness bad debt must be treated as a short-term capital loss and can be deducted only in the year the debt becomes totally worthless.

You can exclude up to 60% of the qualified gain on certain empowerment zone business stock for gain attributable to periods on or before December 31, 2018. The 60% exclusion doesn\\'t apply to gain attributable to periods after December 31, 2018. See Empowerment zone business stock, later. The exclusion is increased to 75% on the sale or exchange of QSB stock acquired after February 17, 2009, and before September 28, 2010. The exclusion is increased to 100% on the sale of QSB stock acquired after September 27, 2010.\\nTo be QSB stock, the stock must meet all of the following tests:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt must be stock in a C corporation (that is, not S corporation stock).\\n\\n\\nIt must have been originally issued after August 10, 1993.\\n\\n\\nAs of the date the stock was issued, the corporation was a QSB. A QSB is a domestic C corporation with total gross assets of $50 million or less (a) at all times after August 9, 1993, and before the stock was issued, and (b) immediately after the stock was issued. Gross assets include those of any predecessor of the corporation. All corporations that are members of the same parent-subsidiary controlled group are treated as one corporation.\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust acquired the stock at its original issue (either directly or through an underwriter), either in exchange for money or other property or as pay for services (other than as an underwriter) to the corporation. In certain cases, the estate or trust may meet the test if it acquired the stock from another person who met this test (such as by gift or inheritance) or through a conversion or exchange of QSB stock the estate or trust held.\\n\\n\\nDuring substantially all the time the estate or trust held the stock:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe corporation was a C corporation,\\n\\n\\nAt least 80% of the value of the corporation\\'s assets was used in the active conduct of one or more qualified businesses (defined below), and\\n\\n\\nThe corporation wasn\\'t a foreign corporation, DISC, former DISC, corporation that has made (or that has a subsidiary that has made) a section 936 election, regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, real estate mortgage investment conduit, financial asset securitization investment trust, or cooperative.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNote.\\nA specialized small business investment company (SSBIC) is treated as having met test 5b above.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQualified business.\\nA qualified business is any business other than the following: \\n\\n\\n\\nOne involving services performed in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage services;\\n\\n\\nOne whose principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more employees;\\n\\n\\nAny banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business;\\n\\n\\nAny farming business (including the raising or harvesting of trees);\\n\\n\\nAny business involving the production of products for which percentage depletion can be claimed; or\\n\\n\\nAny business of operating a hotel, motel, restaurant, or similar business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor more details about limits and additional requirements that may apply, see Pub. 550 or section 1202.\\n\\n\\nAcquisition date of stock acquired after February 17, 2009.\\nWhen determining whether the exclusion is limited to 50%, 75%, or 100% of the gain from the QSB stock, the acquisition date is considered to be the first day the stock is held (determined after applying the holding period rules in section 1223).\\n\\n\\nEmpowerment zone business stock.\\nGenerally, the estate or trust can exclude up to 60% of its gain on certain QSB stock if it meets the following additional requirements. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe stock sold or exchanged was stock in a corporation that qualified as an empowerment zone business during substantially all of the time the estate or trust held the stock.\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust acquired the stock after December 21, 2000, and before February 18, 2009.\\n\\n\\nThe gain from the sale or exchange of the stock is attributable to periods on or before December 31, 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRequirement 1 will still be met if the corporation ceased to qualify after the 5-year period that began on the date the estate or trust acquired the stock. However, the gain that qualifies for the 60% exclusion can\\'t be more than the gain the estate or trust would have had if it had sold the stock on the date the corporation ceased to qualify.\\nSee section 1397C for more details.\\n\\n\\nStock acquired after February 17, 2009.\\nThe estate or trust can exclude up to 75% of the gain if it acquired the stock after February 17, 2009, and before September 28, 2010. \\nThe estate or trust can exclude up to 100% of the gain if it acquired the stock after September 27, 2010.\\n\\n\\nPass-through entities.\\nIf the estate or trust held an interest in a pass-through entity (a partnership, S corporation, mutual fund, or other regulated investment company) that sold QSB stock, the estate or trust generally must have held the interest on the date the pass-through entity acquired the QSB stock and at all times thereafter until the stock was sold to qualify for the exclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow to report.\\nReport the sale or exchange of the QSB stock on Form 8949, Part II, with the appropriate box checked, as you would if you weren\\'t taking the exclusion.

See the Instructions for Form 8997 for details.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLines 1a and 8a—Transactions Not Reported on Form 8949\\nThe estate or trust can report on line 1a (for short-term transactions) or line 8a (for long-term transactions) the aggregate totals from any transactions (except sales of collectibles) for which:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) that shows basis was reported to the IRS and doesn\\'t show any adjustments in boxes 1f or 1g,\\n\\n\\nThe Ordinary check box in box 2 of Form 1099-B is not checked,\\n\\n\\nThe QOF check box in box 3 of Form 1099-B is not checked,\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust isn\\'t electing to defer income due to an investment in a QOF and isn\\'t terminating deferral from an investment in a QOF, and\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust doesn\\'t need to make any adjustments to the basis or type of gain or loss (short term or long term) reported on Form 1099-B (or substitute statement), or to its gain or loss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSee How To Complete Form 8949, Columns (f) and (g), in the Form 8949 instructions for details about possible adjustments to your gain or loss.\\nIf the estate or trust chooses to report these transactions on lines 1a and 8a, don\\'t report them on Form 8949. You don\\'t need to attach a statement to explain the entries on lines 1a and 8a.\\nFigure gain or loss on each line. First, subtract the cost or other basis in column (e) from the proceeds (sales price) in column (d). Enter the gain or loss in column (h). Enter negative amounts in parentheses.\\nExample 1 – basis reported to the IRS.  The estate or trust received a Form 1099-B reporting the sale of stock held for 3 years. It shows proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 is checked, meaning that basis was reported to the IRS. The estate or trust doesn\\'t need to make any adjustments to the amounts reported on Form 1099-B or enter any codes. This was the estate or trust\\'s only 2019 transaction. Instead of reporting this transaction on Form 8949, the estate or trust can enter $6,000 on Schedule D, line 8a, column (d), $2,000 in column (e), and $4,000 ($6,000 – $2,000) in column (h).\\nIf you had a second transaction that was the same except that the proceeds were $5,000 and the basis was $3,000, combine the two transactions. Enter $11,000 ($6,000 + $5,000) on Schedule D, line 8a, column (d); $5,000 ($2,000 + $3,000) in column (e); and $6,000 ($11,000 – $5,000) in column (h).\\nExample 2 – basis not reported to the IRS.  The estate or trust received a Form 1099-B showing proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 isn\\'t checked, meaning that basis wasn\\'t reported to the IRS. Don\\'t report this transaction on line 1a or line 8a. Instead, report the transaction on Form 8949. Complete all necessary pages of Form 8949 before completing line 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, or 10 of Schedule D (Form 1041).\\nExample 3 – adjustment.  The estate or trust received a Form 1099-B showing proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 is checked, meaning that basis was reported to the IRS. However, the basis shown in box 1e is incorrect. Don\\'t report this transaction on line 1a or line 8a. Instead, report the transaction on Form 8949. See the Instructions for Form 8949, columns (f), (g), and (h). Complete all necessary pages of Form 8949 before completing line 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, or 10 of Schedule D (Form 1041).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLines 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, and 10, Column (h)—Transactions Reported on Form 8949\\nFigure gain or loss on each line. First, subtract the cost or other basis in column (e) from the proceeds (sales price) in column (d). Then combine the result with any adjustments in column (g). Enter the gain or loss in column (h). Enter negative amounts in parentheses.\\nExample 1 – gain.  Column (d) is $6,000 and column (e) is $2,000. Enter $4,000 in column (h).\\nExample 2 – loss.  Column (d) is $6,000 and column (e) is $8,000. Enter ($2,000) in column (h).\\nExample 3 – adjustment.  Column (d) is $6,000, column (e) is $2,000, and column (g) is ($1,000). Enter $3,000 ($6,000 − $2,000 − $1,000) in column (h).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLines 4 and 11\\n\\nUndistributed capital gains.\\n\\nInclude on line 11, column (h), the amount from box 1a of Form 2439. This amount represents the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of undistributed long-term capital gains from a regulated investment company (mutual fund) or real estate investment trust.\\n \\nIf there is an amount in box 1b of Form 2439, include that amount on line 11 of the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet, later, if you are required to complete line 18b, column (2) of the schedule. If there is an amount in box 1c of Form 2439, see Exclusion of Gain on Qualified Small Business (QSB) Stock (Section 1202), earlier. If there is an amount in box 1d of Form 2439, include that amount on line 4 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet. \\n \\nEnter on Form 1041, Schedule G, Part II, line 16a, the tax paid as reported in box 2 of Form 2439. Increase the basis of the stock by the excess of the amount included in income over the amount of the credit for tax paid. See Pub. 550 for more details.\\n\\n\\nInstallment sales.\\n\\nIf the estate or trust sold property (other than publicly traded stocks or securities) at a gain during the tax year and will receive a payment in a later tax year, you generally report the sale on the installment method and file Form 6252, unless you elect not to do so.\\n \\nAlso, use Form 6252 to report any payment received in 2019 from a sale made in an earlier tax year that was reported on the installment method.\\n \\nTo elect out of the installment method, report the full amount of the gain on Form 8949 on a timely filed return (including extensions) for the year of the sale. If the original return was filed timely, the election may be made on an amended return filed no later than 6 months after the due date of the original return (excluding extensions). Write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" at the top of the amended return, and file it at the same address as the original Form 1041.\\n\\n\\nExchange of \"like-kind\" property.\\n\\nGenerally, no gain or loss is recognized when property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is exchanged solely for property of a like kind to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment. However, if a trust exchanges like-kind property with a related person (see Related Persons, earlier) and within 2 years of the last transfer that was part of the exchange, the related person disposes of the property, or the trust disposes of the property received in exchange from the related person, then the original exchange will not qualify for nonrecognition. See section 1031(f) for exceptions.\\n \\nComplete and attach Form 8824 to Form 1041 for each exchange.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 13—Capital Gain Distributions\\nEnter as a long-term capital gain on line 13, column (h), the total capital gain distributions paid during the year, regardless of how long the estate or trust held its investment. This amount is reported in box 2a of Form 1099-DIV. If there is an amount in box 2b, include that amount on line 11 of the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet, later, if the worksheet is required. If there is an amount in box 2c, see Exclusion of Gain on Qualified Small Business (QSB) Stock (Section 1202), earlier.

Include only those short-term capital losses that are taken into account in determining the amount of gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets that is paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiary during the tax year. See Regulations section 1.643(a)-3 for more information about allocation of capital gains and losses.\\nIf the losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets are more than the gains, the net loss must be allocated to the estate or trust and not to the beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 17, Column (2)—Estate\\'s or Trust\\'s Net Short-Term Capital Gain or Loss\\nEnter the amount of the net short-term capital gain or loss allocable to the estate or trust. Include any capital gain paid or permanently set aside for a charitable purpose specified in section 642(c).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 17, Column (3)—Total\\nEnter the total of the amounts entered in columns (1) and (2). The amount in column (3) should be the same as the amount on line 7.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 18a—Net Long-Term Capital Gain or Loss\\nAllocate the net long-term capital gain or loss on line 18a in the same manner as the net short-term capital gain or loss on line 17. However, don\\'t take the section 1202 exclusion on gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock into account when figuring net long-term capital gain or loss allocable to the beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 18b—Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain\\n\\nComplete the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet, later, if any of the following apply.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the tax year, the estate or trust sold or otherwise disposed of section 1250 property (generally, real property that was depreciated) held more than 1 year.\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust received installment payments during the tax year for section 1250 property held more than 1 year and is reporting gain on the installment method.\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust received a Schedule K-1 from an estate or trust, partnership, or S corporation that reports \"unrecaptured section 1250 gain\" for the tax year.\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust received a Form 1099-DIV or Form 2439 from a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company (including a mutual fund) that reports \"unrecaptured section 1250 gain\" for the tax year.\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust reported a long-term capital gain from the sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership that owned section 1250 property.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUnrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet—Line 18b\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf the estate or trust isn\\'t reporting a gain on Form 4797, line 7, skip lines 1 through 9 and go to line 10.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n1.\\nIf the estate or trust has a section 1250 property in Part III of Form 4797 for which you made an entry in Part I of Form 4797 (but not on Form 6252), enter the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of Form 4797 for that property.

This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable lines of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStep 2.\\nReduce the amount figured in step 1 by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable line of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain that must be allocated to the installment payments received from the sale.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStep 3.\\nGenerally, the amount of section 1231 gain on each installment payment is treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain until the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain figured in step 2 has been used in full. Figure the amount of gain treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for installment payments received during the tax year as the smaller of (a) the amount from line 26 or line 37 of the 2019 Form 6252, whichever applies, or (b) the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported. This amount is generally the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture). However, if you chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount you chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale. Include this amount on line 4.\\n\\n\\n\\nLine 10.\\nInclude on line 10 the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of the partnership\\'s unrecaptured section 1250 gain that would result if the partnership had transferred all of its section 1250 property in a fully taxable transaction immediately before the estate or trust sold or exchanged its interest in that partnership.

This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of the 2019 Form 4797 (or comparable lines of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStep 2.\\nReduce the amount figured in step 1 by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable line of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain that must be allocated to the installment payments received from the sale.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStep 3.\\nGenerally, the amount of capital gain on each installment payment is treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain until the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain figured in step 2 has been used in full. Figure the amount of gain treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for installment payments received during the tax year as the smaller of (a) the amount from line 26 or line 37 of the 2019 Form 6252, whichever applies, or (b) the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported. This amount is generally the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture). However, if you chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount you chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale. Include this amount on line 12.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOther sales or dispositions of section 1250 property.\\nFor each sale of property held more than 1 year (for which an entry wasn\\'t made in Part I of Form 4797), figure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable or (b) the total gain for the sale. This amount is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of Form 4797 for that property. Then, reduce that amount by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of Form 4797 for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale.

To figure your adjusted alternative minimum taxable income, any section 199A deduction taken on line 20 of Form 1041 must be included as a negative amount on line 21.\\n\\n\\nESBT reporting.\\nThe instructions have been updated to include directions for Electing small business trusts (ESBTs). See Line 1 Adjusted total income or (loss), later.\\n\\n\\nAMT tax brackets.\\nThe threshold for the 28% AMT tax bracket increased to amounts over $194,800.\\n\\n\\nAMT exemption amount and phaseout.\\nThe AMT exemption amount increased to $25,000. The exemption amount begins to be phased-out at amounts over $83,500 and is completely phased-out at $183,500. \\n\\n\\nCapital gains and qualified dividends.\\nFor tax year 2019, the 20% maximum capital gains rate applies to estates and trusts with income above $12,950. The 0% and 15% rates continue to apply to certain threshold amounts. The 0% rate applies to amounts up to $2,650. The 15% rate applies to amounts over $2,650 and up to $12,950. \\n\\n\\nBiofuel producer credit and biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit.\\nRecent legislation extended these credits. These credits are available for tax years 2018 and 2019. If claiming any of these credits for tax year 2019, you may also need to make an adjustment on line 21. See Line 21 Other Adjustments, later. If claiming any of these credits for tax year 2018, file an amended return, which may also include making an adjustment (as explained in Line 21—Other Adjustments) on line 23 of the 2018 Schedule I (Form 1041). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReminders\\n\\nOpportunity zone exclusion.\\nYou may need to make an adjustment to the capital gain you deferred from income for regular tax as a result of investing in a qualified opportunity fund. See Line 11 Disposition of Property, later. \\n\\n\\nExcess business loss limitation.\\nYou may need to make an adjustment to the amount you included in income for regular tax as a result of this limitation when determining alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI). See Excess business loss limitation, later.\\n\\n\\nBusiness interest limitation.\\nYou may need to make an adjustment to the amount of business interest you deducted for regular tax as a result of this limitation when determining AMTI. See Business interest limitation, later. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPurpose of Schedule\\nUse Schedule I (Form 1041) to figure:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estate\\'s or trust\\'s alternative minimum taxable income;\\n\\n\\nThe income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis; and\\n\\n\\nThe estate\\'s or trust\\'s alternative minimum tax (AMT).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nESBTs. An ESBT must figure the AMT for the S and non-S portions of the trust on separate Schedules I (Form 1041). The Schedule I for each portion includes only the income, deductions, and credits attributable to that portion.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must Complete Schedule I (Form 1041)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nComplete Parts I and II if the estate or trust is required to complete Form 1041, Schedule B, Income Distribution Deduction.\\n\\n\\nComplete Schedule I if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of alternative minimum taxable income (Part I, line 27) exceeds $25,000.\\n\\n\\nComplete Schedule I if the estate or trust claims any general business credit and line 6 of Part I or line 3 of Part III of Form 3800, General Business Credit, is more than zero.\\n\\n\\nESBTs. Complete Schedule I if the alternative minimum taxable income (Part I, line 27) of the S portion of the trust is more than zero or the S portion of the trust claims any general business credit and line 6 of Part I or line 3 of Part III of the Form 3800 is more than zero.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRecordkeeping\\nSchedule I contains adjustments and tax preference items that are treated differently for regular tax and AMT purposes. If you, as fiduciary for the estate or trust, completed a form to figure an item for regular tax purposes, you may have to complete it a second time for AMT purposes. Generally, the difference between the amounts on the two forms is the AMT adjustment or tax preference item to enter on Schedule I. Except for Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit (Individual, Estate, or Trust), any additional form completed for AMT purposes doesn\\'t have to be filed with Form 1041.\\nFor regular tax purposes, some deductions and credits may result in carrybacks or carryforwards to other tax years. Examples are investment interest expense, a net operating loss deduction (NOLD), a capital loss, and the foreign tax credit. Because these items may be refigured for the AMT, the carryback or carryforward amount may be different for regular and AMT purposes. Therefore, you should keep records of these different carryforward and carryback amounts for the AMT and regular tax. The AMT carryforward will be important in completing Schedule I for 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCredit for Prior Year Minimum Tax\\nEstates and trusts that paid AMT in 2018, or had a minimum tax credit carryforward from the 2018 Form 8801, Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax—Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, may be eligible for a minimum tax credit in 2019. See Form 8801.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPartners and Shareholders\\nAn estate or trust that is a partner in a partnership or a shareholder in an S corporation must take into account its share of items of income and deductions that enter into the computation of its adjustments and tax preference items.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAllocation of Deductions to Beneficiaries\\nThe distributable net alternative minimum taxable income (DNAMTI) of the estate or trust doesn\\'t include amounts of depreciation, depletion, and amortization that are allocated to the beneficiaries, just as the distributable net income of the estate or trust doesn\\'t include these items for regular tax purposes.\\nReport separately in box 12 of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), Beneficiary\\'s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc., any adjustments or tax preference items attributable to accelerated depreciation (code G), depletion (code H), and amortization (code I) that were allocated to the beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOptional Write-Off for Certain Expenditures\\nThere is no AMT adjustment for the following items if the estate or trust elects to deduct them ratably over the period of time shown for the regular tax.\\n\\n\\n\\nCirculation expenditures—3 years (section 173).\\n\\n\\nResearch and experimental expenditures—10 years (section 174(a)).\\n\\n\\nIntangible drilling costs—60 months (section 263(c)).\\n\\n\\nMining exploration and development costs—10 years (sections 616(a) and 617(a)).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe election must be made in the year the expenditure was made and may be revoked only with IRS consent. See section 59(e) and Regulations section 1.59-1 for more details.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nESBTs. Use a separate Schedule I (Form 1041) to figure the AMT for the S portion of the trust. Add the notation “ESBT” to the top of the Schedule I and attach it to the tax computation attachment for Form 1041. See the ESBT Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhere these instructions refer to completing other forms and worksheets, you must complete separate forms and worksheets for the S and non-S portions of the trust. Where necessary, add an \"ESBT\" notation at the top of the form or worksheet to show it relates to the computation for the S portion of the trust.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart I—Estate\\'s or Trust\\'s Share of Alternative Minimum Taxable Income\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 1—Adjusted total income or (loss)\\nAdjusted total income or (loss) (from Form 1041, line 17 or ESBT Tax Worksheet, line 13). See the ESBT Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 2—Interest\\nIn determining the alternative minimum taxable income, qualified residence interest (other than qualified housing interest defined in section 56(e)) isn\\'t allowed.\\nIf you completed Form 4952, Investment Interest Expense Deduction, for regular tax purposes, you may have an adjustment on this line. Refigure your investment interest expense on a separate AMT Form 4952 as follows.\\n\\nStep 1.\\nOn line 1 of the AMT Form 4952, follow the instructions for that line, but also include the following amounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny qualified residence interest (other than qualified housing interest) that was paid or accrued on a loan or part of a loan that is allocable to property held for investment as defined in section 163(d)(5) (for example, interest on a home equity loan whose proceeds were invested in stocks or bonds).\\n\\n\\nAny interest that would have been deductible if interest on specified private activity bonds had been included in income. See the instructions for line 7 for the definition of specified private activity bonds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nStep 2.\\nOn line 2, enter the AMT disallowed investment interest expense from 2018.\\n\\n\\nStep 3.\\nWhen completing Part II of the AMT Form 4952, refigure gross income from property held for investment, any net gain from the disposition of property held for investment, net capital gain from the disposition of property held for investment, and any investment expenses, taking into account all AMT adjustments and tax preference items that apply. Include any interest income and investment expenses from private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986.\\nWhen completing line 4g of the AMT Form 4952, enter the smaller of:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe amount from line 4g of the regular tax Form 4952, or\\n\\n\\nThe total of lines 4b and 4e of the AMT Form 4952.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nStep 4.\\nComplete Part III.\\nEnter on Schedule I, line 2 the difference between line 8 of the AMT Form 4952 and line 8 of the regular tax Form 4952. If the AMT deduction is greater, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 3—Taxes\\nEnter any state or local real property taxes; state or local personal property taxes; state and local general sales taxes; and any state, local, or foreign income taxes that were included on Form 1041, page 1, line 11.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 4—Refund of Taxes\\nEnter any refunds received in 2019 of taxes described for line 3 above and included in income. Also, include foreign real property taxes that were deducted in years prior to 2019, but refunded in 2019 and included in income on Form 1041.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 5—Depletion\\nRefigure the depletion deduction for AMT purposes by using only the income and deductions allowed for the AMT when refiguring the limit based on taxable income from the property under section 613(a) and the limit based on taxable income, with certain adjustments, under section 613A(d)(1). Also, the depletion deduction for mines, wells, and other natural deposits under section 611 is limited to the property\\'s adjusted basis at the end of the year, as refigured for the AMT, unless the estate or trust is an independent producer or royalty owner claiming percentage depletion for oil and gas wells. Figure this limit separately for each property. When refiguring the property\\'s adjusted basis, take into account any AMT adjustments made this year or in previous years that affect basis (other than the current year\\'s depletion).\\nEnter on line 5 the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction. If the AMT deduction is more than the regular tax deduction, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 6—Net Operating Loss Deduction\\nEnter any NOLD from line 15b of page 1 of the Form 1041 as a positive amount.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 7—Interest From Specified Private Activity Bonds Exempt From the Regular Tax\\nEnter the interest earned from specified private activity bonds reduced (but not below zero) by any deduction that would have been allowable if the interest were includible in gross income for regular tax purposes. Each payer of this type of interest should send a Form 1099-INT, Interest Income, to the estate or trust showing the amount of this interest in box 9. Generally, specified private activity bonds are any qualified bonds (as defined in section 141) issued after August 7, 1986, and before 2009 or after 2010, the interest on which isn\\'t includible in gross income for the regular tax. See section 57(a)(5) for more information.\\nDon’t include interest on qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone bonds described in section 1400N(a) or qualified Midwestern disaster area bonds.\\nExempt-interest dividends paid by a regulated investment company are treated as interest from specified private activity bonds to the extent the dividends are attributable to interest on the bonds received by the company, minus an allocable share of the expenses paid or incurred by the company in earning the interest. This amount should also be reported to the estate or trust on Form 1099-DIV in box 12.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 8—Qualified Small Business Stock\\nIf the estate or trust claimed the exclusion under section 1202 for gain on qualified small business stock acquired before September 28, 2010, and held more than 5 years, multiply the excluded gain (as shown on Form 8949 in column (g)) by 7% (.07). Enter the result on line 8 as a positive amount.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 9—Exercise of Incentive Stock Options\\nFor regular tax purposes, no income is recognized when an incentive stock option (as defined in section 422(b)) is exercised. However, this rule doesn\\'t apply for AMT purposes. Instead, the estate or trust must generally include on line 9 the excess, if any, of:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fair market value (FMV) of the stock acquired through exercise of the option (determined without regard to any lapse restriction) when its rights in the acquired stock first become transferable or when these rights are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, over\\n\\n\\nThe amount paid for the stock, including any amount paid for the option used to acquire the stock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEven if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s rights in the stock aren\\'t transferable and are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, you may elect to include in AMT income the excess of the stock\\'s FMV (determined without regard to any lapse restriction) over the exercise price upon the transfer to the estate or trust of the stock acquired through exercise of the option.

The election must be made no later than 30 days after the date of transfer.\\nIf the estate or trust acquired stock by exercising an option and it disposed of that stock in the same year, the tax treatment under the regular tax and the AMT is the same, and no adjustment is required.\\nIncrease the AMT basis of any stock acquired through the exercise of an incentive stock option by the amount of the adjustment.\\n\\nNote.\\nIf a Form 3921, Exercise of an Incentive Stock Option Under Section 422(b), was received, it may help you figure the adjustment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 10—Other Estates and Trusts\\nIf the estate or trust is the beneficiary of another estate or trust, enter the adjustment for minimum tax purposes from box 12, code A, Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).\\nESBTs. Enter an amount on this line only if the S corporation was a beneficiary of an estate or trust, received a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) from the estate or trust with an entry in box 12, code A, and the S corporation allocated a portion of the box 12, code A amount to the ESBT. See Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S), box 15, code F.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 11—Disposition of Property\\nUse this line to report any AMT adjustment related to the disposition of property resulting from refiguring:\\n\\n\\n\\nGain or loss from the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property reported on Form 4797, Sales of Business Property;\\n\\n\\nCasualty gain or loss to business or income-producing property reported on Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts;\\n\\n\\nOrdinary income from the disposition of property not taken into account in 1 or 2 above or on any other line on Schedule I, such as a disqualifying disposition of stock acquired in a prior year by exercising an incentive stock option; and\\n\\n\\nCapital gain or loss (including any carryover that is different for the AMT) reported on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets, or Schedule D (Form 1041), Capital Gains and Losses.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe $3,000 capital loss limitation for the regular tax applies separately for the AMT.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFirst, figure any ordinary income adjustment related to 3, earlier. Then, refigure Form 4684, Form 4797, Form 8949, and Schedule D (Form 1041) for the AMT, if applicable, by taking into account any adjustments you made this year or in previous years that affect the estate\\'s or trust\\'s basis or otherwise result in a different amount for AMT. When you refigure your gain or loss on Form 8949 for AMT, the amount of gain you elected to defer for regular tax purposes due to an investment in a qualified opportunity fund may need to be adjusted on your AMT Form 8949. An adjustment may be required if the regular tax and AMT adjusted basis of the property you sold prior to your investment is different.\\nIf the estate or trust has a capital loss after refiguring Schedule D for the AMT, apply the $3,000 capital loss limitation separately to the AMT loss. For each of the four items listed above, figure the difference between the amount included in taxable income for the regular tax and the amount included in income for the AMT. Treat the difference as a negative amount if (a) both the AMT and regular tax amounts are zero or more and the AMT amount is less than the regular tax amount or (b) the AMT amount is a loss, and the regular tax amount is a smaller loss, or zero or more.\\nEnter on line 11 the combined adjustments for the four items earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 12—Depreciation on Assets Placed in Service After 1986\\nThis section describes when depreciation must be refigured for the AMT and how to figure the amount to enter on line 12.\\nDon’t include on this line any depreciation adjustment from:\\n\\n\\n\\nAn activity for which the estate or trust isn\\'t at risk or income or loss from a partnership or an S corporation if the basis limitations under section 704(d) or 1366(d) apply. Take this adjustment into account on line 14;\\n\\n\\nA tax shelter farm activity. Take this adjustment into account on line 21; or\\n\\n\\nA passive activity. Take this adjustment into account on line 13.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhat depreciation must be refigured for the AMT?\\nGenerally, you must refigure depreciation for the AMT, including depreciation allocable to inventory costs, for: \\n\\n\\n\\nProperty placed in service after 1998 that is depreciated for the regular tax using the 200% declining balance method (generally 3-, 5-, 7-, or 10-year property under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS), except for certain qualified property eligible for the special depreciation allowance (discussed later)), \\n\\n\\nSection 1250 property placed in service after 1998 that isn\\'t depreciated for the regular tax using the straight line method, and\\n\\n\\nTangible property placed in service after 1986 and before 1999. If the transitional election was made under section 203(a)(1)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, this rule applies to property placed in service after July 31, 1986.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat depreciation isn\\'t refigured for the AMT?\\nDon’t refigure depreciation for the AMT for the following items. \\n\\n\\n\\nResidential rental property placed in service after 1998.\\n\\n\\nNonresidential real property with a class life of 27.5 years or more placed in service after 1998 that is depreciated for the regular tax using the straight line method.\\n\\n\\nOther section 1250 property placed in service after 1998 that is depreciated for the regular tax using the straight line method.\\n\\n\\nProperty (other than section 1250 property) placed in service after 1998 that is depreciated for the regular tax using the 150% declining balance method or the straight line method.\\n\\n\\nProperty for which you elected to use the alternative depreciation system (ADS) of section 168(g) for the regular tax.\\n\\n\\nQualified property that is or was eligible for the special depreciation allowance if the depreciable basis of the property for the AMT is the same as for the regular tax. This applies to any special depreciation allowance, including those for qualified disaster assistance property, qualified reuse and recycling property, qualified cellulosic biofuel plant property, qualified New York Liberty Zone property, qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property, and Kansas disaster area qualified recovery assistance property. The special allowance is deductible for the AMT, and there also is no adjustment required for any depreciation figured on the remaining basis of the qualified property if the depreciable basis of the property for the AMT is the same as for the regular tax. Property for which an election is in effect to not have the special allowance apply isn\\'t qualified property. In addition, if you elect not to have any special depreciation allowance apply, the property may be subject to an AMT adjustment for depreciation if it was placed in service before 2016. It is not subject to an AMT adjustment for depreciation if it was placed in service after 2015. \\n\\n\\nMotion picture films, videotapes, or sound recordings.\\n\\n\\nProperty depreciated under the unit-of-production method or any other method not expressed in a term of years.\\n\\n\\nQualified Indian reservation property.\\n\\n\\nA natural gas gathering line placed in service after April 11, 2005.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHow is depreciation refigured for the AMT?\\nSee methods below.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nProperty placed in service before 1999.\\nRefigure depreciation for the AMT using ADS with the same convention used for the regular tax.

For property other than section 1250 property, use the 150% declining balance method, switching to straight line the first tax year it gives a larger deduction. For section 1250 property, use the straight line method.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is the AMT class life determined?\\nThe class life used for the AMT isn\\'t necessarily the same as the recovery period used for the regular tax. The class lives for the AMT are listed in Rev. Proc. 87-56, 1987-2 C.B. 674, and in Pub. 946, How To Depreciate Property. Use 12 years for any tangible personal property not assigned a class life.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSee Pub. 946 for optional tables that can be used to figure AMT depreciation. Rev. Proc. 89-15, 1989-1 C.B. 816, has special rules for short tax years and for property disposed of before the end of the recovery period.\\n\\n\\nHow is the line 12 adjustment figured?\\nSubtract the AMT deduction for depreciation from the regular tax deduction and enter the result. If the AMT deduction is more than the regular tax deduction, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\nIn addition to the AMT adjustment to your deduction for depreciation, you must also adjust the amount of depreciation that was capitalized, if any, to account for the difference between the rules for the regular tax and the AMT. Include on this line the current year adjustment to taxable income, if any, resulting from the difference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 13—Passive Activities\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t enter again elsewhere on this schedule any AMT adjustment or tax preference item included on this line.\\nFor AMT purposes, the rules described in section 469 apply, except that in applying the limitations, minimum tax rules apply.\\nRefigure passive activity gains and losses on an AMT basis. Refigure a passive activity gain or loss by taking into account all AMT adjustments or tax preference items that pertain to that activity.\\nYou may complete a second Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations, to determine the passive activity losses allowed for AMT purposes, but don\\'t send this AMT Form 8582 to the IRS.\\nEnter the difference between the loss reported for regular tax purposes and the AMT loss, if any.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe amount of any passive activity loss that isn\\'t deductible (and is therefore carried forward) for AMT purposes is likely to differ from the amount (if any) that is carried forward for regular tax purposes. Therefore, it is essential that you retain adequate records for both AMT and regular tax purposes.\\n\\nPublicly traded partnerships (PTPs).\\nIf the estate or trust had a loss from a PTP, refigure the loss using any AMT adjustments, tax preference items, and any AMT prior year unallowed loss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 14—Loss Limitations\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf the loss is from a passive activity, use line 13 instead. If the loss is from a tax shelter farm activity (that isn\\'t passive), use line 21.\\nRefigure your allowable losses for AMT purposes from activities for which you aren\\'t at risk and basis limitations applicable to interests in partnerships and stock in S corporations by taking into account your AMT adjustments and tax preference items. See sections 59(h), 465, 704(d), and 1366(d).\\nEnter the difference between the loss reported for regular tax purposes and the AMT loss. If the AMT loss is more than the loss reported for regular tax purposes, enter the adjustment as a negative amount.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 15—Circulation Costs\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t make this adjustment for expenditures for which you elected the optional 3-year write-off period for regular tax purposes.\\nCirculation expenditures deducted under section 173(a) for regular tax purposes must be amortized for AMT purposes over 3 years beginning with the year the expenditures were paid or incurred.\\nEnter the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction. If the AMT deduction is greater, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\nIf the estate or trust had a loss on property for which circulation expenditures haven\\'t been fully amortized for the AMT, the AMT deduction is the smaller of (a) the amount of the loss allowable for the expenditures had they remained capitalized or (b) the remaining expenditures to be amortized for the AMT.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 16—Long-Term Contracts\\nFor AMT purposes, the percentage of completion method of accounting described in section 460(b) generally must be used. However, this rule doesn\\'t apply to any home construction contract (as defined in section 460(e)(6)).\\n\\nNote.\\nContracts described in section 460(e)(1)(B) are subject to the simplified method of cost allocation of section 460(b)(4).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEnter the difference between the AMT and regular tax income.

If the amount allowed for AMT purposes exceeds the amount deducted for regular tax purposes, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\nIf the estate or trust had a loss on property for which mining expenditures haven\\'t been fully amortized for the AMT, the AMT deduction is the smaller of (a) the amount of the loss allowable for the expenditures had they remained capitalized or (b) the remaining expenditures to be amortized for the AMT.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 18—Research and Experimental Costs\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t make this adjustment for costs paid or incurred in connection with an activity in which the estate or trust materially participated under the passive activity rules or for costs for which you elected the optional 10-year write-off for research and experimental expenditures under section 59(e) for regular tax purposes.\\nResearch and experimental expenditures deducted under section 174(a) for regular tax purposes generally must be amortized for AMT purposes over 10 years beginning with the year the expenditures were paid or incurred.\\nEnter the difference between the amount allowed for AMT purposes and the amount allowed for regular tax purposes. If the amount for AMT purposes exceeds the amount allowed for regular tax purposes, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\nIf the estate or trust had a loss on property for which research and experimental costs haven\\'t been fully amortized for the AMT, the AMT deduction is the smaller of (a) the loss allowable for the costs had they remained capitalized or (b) the remaining costs to be amortized for the AMT.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 19—Income From Certain Installment Sales Before January 1, 1987\\nThe installment method doesn\\'t apply for AMT purposes to any nondealer disposition of property that occurred after August 16, 1986, but before the first day of your tax year that began in 1987, if an installment obligation to which the proportionate disallowance rule applied arose from the disposition. Enter on line 19 the amount of installment sale income that was reported for regular tax purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 20—Intangible Drilling Costs Preference (IDCs)\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t make this adjustment for costs for which you elected the optional 60-month write-off under section 59(e) for regular tax purposes.\\nIDCs from oil, gas, and geothermal wells are a preference to the extent that the excess IDCs exceed 65% of the net income from the wells. Figure the preference for all oil and gas properties separately from the preference for all geothermal properties.\\nFigure excess IDCs as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the amount of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s IDCs allowed for the regular tax under section 263(c), but don’t include any section 263(c) deduction for nonproductive wells, then\\n\\n\\nSubtract the amount that would have been allowed had you amortized these IDCs over a 120-month period starting with the month the well was placed in production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCost depletion can be substituted for the amount allowed using amortization over 120 months.\\n\\nNet income.\\nDetermine net income by reducing the gross income that the estate or trust received or accrued during the tax year from all oil, gas, and geothermal wells by the deductions allocable to those wells (reduced by the excess IDCs). When refiguring net income, use only income and deductions allowed for the AMT.\\n\\n\\nException.\\nThe preference for IDCs from oil and gas wells doesn\\'t apply to taxpayers who are independent producers (that is, not integrated oil companies as defined in section 291(b)(4)). However, this benefit may be limited. First, figure the IDC preference as if this exception didn\\'t apply. For purposes of this exception, complete and combine lines 1 through 21, including the IDC preference. If the amount of the IDC preference exceeds 40% of the total of lines 1 through 21, enter the excess on line 20 (the benefit of this exception is limited). Otherwise, don’t enter an amount on line 20 (the estate\\'s or trust\\'s benefit from this exception isn\\'t limited).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 21—Other Adjustments\\nEnter on line 21 the total of any other adjustments that apply including the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection 199A deduction. Include as a negative amount on line 21 the section 199A deduction shown on Form 1041, line 20.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nESBTs. Don\\'t include any section 199A deduction taken on line 11, Qualified business income deduction (S portion), of your ESBT Tax Worksheet on line 21 when figuring your adjusted alternative minimum taxable income for the S portion of your trust. This amount is already included on line 1, Adjusted total income or (loss), from line 13 of your ESBT Tax Worksheet.\\n\\n\\nDepreciation figured using pre-1987 rules. For AMT purposes, use the straight line method to figure depreciation on real property. Use a recovery period of 19 years for 19-year real property and 15 years for low-income housing. Enter the excess of depreciation claimed for regular tax purposes over depreciation refigured using the straight line method. Figure this amount separately for each property and include on line 21 only positive amounts.\\nFor leased personal property other than recovery property, enter the amount by which the regular tax depreciation using the pre-1987 rules exceeds the depreciation allowable using the straight line method. For leased 10-year recovery property and leased 15-year public utility property, enter the amount by which the depreciation deduction determined for regular tax purposes is more than the deduction allowable using the straight line method with a half-year convention, no salvage value, and a recovery period of 15 years (22 years for 15-year public utility property). Figure this amount separately for each property and include on line 21 only positive amounts.\\n\\n\\nAmortization of pollution control facilities. The amortization deduction under section 169 must be refigured for the AMT. For facilities placed in service after 1986 and before 1999, figure the amortization deduction for the AMT using the ADS described in section 168(g). For facilities placed in service after 1998, figure the AMT deduction under MACRS using the straight line method. Enter the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction. If the AMT amount is greater, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\n\\n\\nTax shelter farm activities. Figure this adjustment only if the tax shelter farm activity (as defined in section 58(a)(2)) isn\\'t a passive activity. If the activity is passive, include it with any other passive activities on line 13.\\nRefigure all gains and losses reported for the regular tax from tax shelter farm activities by taking into account any AMT adjustments and preferences. Determine tax shelter farm activity gain or loss for the AMT using the same rules used for the regular tax with the following modifications. No refigured loss is allowed, except to the extent an estate or trust is insolvent (see section 58(c)(1)). A refigured loss may not be used in the current tax year to offset gains from other tax shelter farm activities. Instead, any refigured loss must be suspended and carried forward indefinitely until (a) the estate or trust has a gain in a subsequent tax year from the same activity or (b) the activity is disposed of.\\nThe AMT amount of any tax shelter farm activity loss that isn\\'t deductible and is carried forward is likely to differ from the regular tax amount. Keep adequate records for both the AMT and regular tax.\\nEnter the difference between the amount that would be reported for the activity on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Supplemental Income and Loss, or Schedule F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Profit or Loss From Farming, for the AMT and the regular tax amount. If (a) the AMT loss is more than the regular tax loss, (b) the AMT gain is less than the regular tax gain, or (c) there is an AMT loss and a regular tax gain, then enter the adjustment as a negative amount.\\nEnter any adjustment for amounts reported on Form 8949, Schedule D (Form 1041), Form 4684, or Form 4797 for the activity on line 11 instead of line 21.\\n\\n\\nBiofuel producer credit and biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit. If the adjusted total income (Form 1041, line 17) includes the amount of the biofuel producer credit or biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit, include that amount as a negative amount on line 21.\\n\\nNote.\\nRecent legislation extended the biofuel producer credit and biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit. The credit is available for 2018 and 2019. If you are eligible for this benefit for tax year 2018, you will need to file an amended Form 1041 return to claim it.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated adjustments. AMT adjustments and tax preference items may affect deductions that are based on an income limit other than adjusted gross income (AGI) or modified AGI (for example, farm conservation expenses). Refigure these deductions using the income limit as modified for the AMT. Include the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction on line 21. If the AMT deduction is more than the regular tax deduction, include the difference as a negative amount.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t make an adjustment on line 21 for an item you refigured on another line of Schedule I (for example, line 5).\\n\\n\\nExcess business loss limitation.\\nComplete an AMT Form 461 using amounts adjusted for AMT. Enter the difference between the AMT and regular tax limitation on losses. If line 16 of the AMT Form 461 is less than the amount on line 16 of the regular tax Form 461, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\n\\n\\nATNOL carryover.\\nKeep your AMT Form 461 for your records because you will carry over the amount you figure on line 16 of your 2019 AMT Form 461 to 2020 and include it when figuring your ATNOLD. \\n\\n\\nNote.\\nYour disallowed AMT excess business loss (figured on an AMT Form 461) for a year is treated as an ATNOL carryover to the following year, even if you wouldn’t otherwise have an ATNOL for that year. Your ATNOL carryover to 2019 will include the amount you figured on line 16 of your 2018 AMT Form 461. You may need to complete a 2018 AMT Form 461 if you weren’t required to file Schedule I (Form 1041) in 2018.\\n\\n\\nBusiness interest limitation.\\nComplete an AMT Form 8990 using amounts adjusted for AMT. Enter the difference between the AMT and regular tax allowable interest expense. If line 30 of the AMT Form 8990 is more than the amount on line 30 of the regular tax Form 8890, enter the difference as a negative amount.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 22—Alternative Tax Net Operating Loss Deduction\\nThe ATNOLD is the sum of the alternative tax net operating loss (ATNOL) carryovers and carrybacks to the tax year (including an ATNOL carryover resulting from a disallowed AMT excess business loss), subject to the limitation explained below.\\nThe net operating loss (NOL) under section 172(c) is modified for alternative tax purposes by (a) taking into account the adjustments made under sections 56 and 58 and (b) reducing the NOL by any item of tax preference under section 57. For an estate or trust that held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), figure the ATNOLD without regard to any excess inclusion.\\nIf this estate or trust is the beneficiary of another estate or trust that terminated in 2019, include any ATNOL carryover that was reported in box 11, code E of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).\\nThe estate\\'s or trust\\'s ATNOLD may be limited. To figure the ATNOLD limitation, first figure alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) without regard to the ATNOLD. For this purpose, figure a tentative amount for line 5 of Schedule I (Form 1041) by treating line 22 as if it were zero. Then, figure a tentative total by combining lines 1–21 of Schedule I (Form 1041) using the line 5 tentative amount. The ATNOLD limitation is 90% of the result.\\nHowever, the 90% limit doesn\\'t apply to an ATNOL that is attributable to qualified disaster losses (as defined in section 172(j)), qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone losses as defined in section 1400N(k)(2), qualified recovery assistance losses (as defined in Pub. 4492-A, Information for Taxpayers Affected by the May 4, 2007, Kansas Storms and Tornadoes), qualified disaster recovery assistance losses (as defined in Pub. 4492-B, Information for Affected Taxpayers in the Midwestern Disaster Areas) or a 2008 or 2009 loss that you elected to carryback more than 2 years under section 172(b)(1)(H). If an ATNOL that is carried back or carried forward to a tax year is attributable to any of those losses, the ATNOLD for the tax year is limited to the sum of:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe smaller of:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sum of the ATNOL carrybacks and carryforwards to the tax year attributable to NOLs other than the losses described in 2a below, or\\n\\n\\n90% of AMTI for the tax year (figured without regard to the ATNOLD), plus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe smaller of:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sum of the ATNOL carrybacks and carryforwards to the tax year attributable to qualified disaster losses, qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone losses, qualified recovery assistance losses, qualified disaster recovery assistance losses, and any 2008 or 2009 loss that you elected to carry back more than 2 years under section 172(b)(1)(H), or\\n\\n\\n100% of AMTI for the tax year (figured without regard to the ATNOLD) reduced by the amount determined under 1, above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEnter on line 22 the smaller of the ATNOLD or the ATNOLD limitation.\\nAny ATNOL not used generally may be carried back 2 years or forward up to 20 years if it arose before your 2018 tax year. Any ATNOL arising after your 2017 tax year generally may be carried forward indefinitely. For more information, see Pub. 536, Net Operating Losses (NOLs) for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts.\\nThe treatment of ATNOLs doesn\\'t affect your regular tax NOL.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you elected under section 172(b)(3) to forego the carryback period for regular tax purposes, the election will also apply for the AMT.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 27—Estate\\'s or Trust\\'s Share of Alternative Minimum Taxable Income\\nFor an estate or trust that held a residual interest in a REMIC, line 27 may not be less than the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of the amount on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 38, column (c).

Thus, for purposes of figuring the allowable income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis, the DNAMTI is figured without regard to any tax-exempt interest (except for amounts from line 7).\\nIf tax-exempt interest is the only tax-exempt income included in the total distributions (line 38), and the DNAMTI (line 35) is less than or equal to line 38, then enter on line 39 the amount from\\nline 29.\\nIf tax-exempt interest is the only tax-exempt income included in the total distributions (line 38), and the DNAMTI is more than line 38 (that is, the estate or trust made a distribution that is less than the DNAMTI), then figure the adjustment by multiplying line 29 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total distributions (line 38), and the denominator of which is the DNAMTI (line 35). Enter the result on line 39.\\nIf line 38 includes tax-exempt income other than tax-exempt interest (except for amounts from line 7), figure line 39 by subtracting the total expenses allocable to tax-exempt income that are allowable for AMT purposes from tax-exempt income included on line 38.\\nExpenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt income are allocated only to tax-exempt income. A reasonable proportion of expenses indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt income and other income must be allocated to each class of income.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 42—Income Distribution Deduction on a Minimum Tax Basis\\nAllocate the income distribution deduction figured on a minimum tax basis among the beneficiaries in the same manner as income was allocated for regular tax purposes. You need the allocated income distribution deduction figured on a minimum tax basis to figure the beneficiary\\'s adjustment for minimum tax purposes, as explained under Box 12–Alternative minimum tax (AMT) items in the Schedule K-1 instruction section of the Instructions for Form 1041 and Schedules A, B, G, J, and K-1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart III—Alternative Minimum Tax Computation\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 51—Alternative Minimum Foreign Tax Credit\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTo see if you need to figure the estate\\'s or trust\\'s AMT foreign tax credit, fill in line 53 of Schedule I as instructed. If the amount on line 53 is greater than or equal to the amount on line 50, the estate or trust doesn\\'t owe the AMT. Enter zero on line 54 and see Who Must Complete earlier to find out if you must file Schedule I with Form 1041. However, even if the estate or trust doesn\\'t owe AMT, you may need to complete line 51 to see if you have an AMT foreign tax credit carryback or carryforward to other tax years.\\nTo figure the AMT foreign tax credit, follow the steps discussed below.\\n\\nStep 1.\\nComplete and attach a separate AMT Form 1116, with the notation at the top \"Alt Min Tax\" for each separate limitation category specified at the top of Form 1116.\\n\\nNote.\\nWhen applying the separate limitation categories, use the applicable AMT rate instead of the regular tax rate to determine if any income is \"high-taxed.\" \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nStep 2.\\nIf you (on behalf of the estate or trust) previously made or are making the Simplified limitation election (as discussed later), skip Part I and enter on the AMT Form 1116, line 17, the same amount you entered on that line for the regular tax. If you didn\\'t complete Form 1116 for the regular tax and you previously made or are making the simplified limitation election (on behalf of the estate or trust), complete Part I and lines 15 through 17 of the AMT Form 1116 using regular tax amounts.\\nIf the election doesn\\'t apply, complete Part I, using only income and deductions allowed for the AMT that are attributable to sources outside the United States. If the estate or trust has any foreign source qualified dividends or foreign source capital gains or losses, use the instructions under Step 3 to determine whether you must make adjustments to those amounts before you include the amounts on line 1a or line 5 of the AMT Form 1116.\\n\\n\\nStep 3.\\nFollow the instructions below, if applicable, to determine the amount of foreign source qualified dividends and foreign source capital gains and losses to include on line 1a and line 5 of the AMT Form 1116.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForeign qualified dividends.\\nYou must adjust the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source qualified dividends before you include those amounts on line 1a of the AMT Form 1116 if: \\n\\n\\n\\nLine 60 of Schedule I (Form 1041) is greater than zero,\\n\\n\\nLine 81 of Schedule I (Form 1041) is smaller than line 82, and\\n\\n\\nThe exception for foreign qualified dividends below doesn\\'t apply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut, you don’t need to make any adjustments if:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe estate or trust qualifies for the adjustment exception under Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet (Estates and Trusts) or Schedule D Filers in the Instructions for Form 1116 and\\n\\n\\nLine 60 of Schedule I (Form 1041) isn\\'t more than $194,800.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNote.\\nUse the estate\\'s or trust\\'s capital gains and losses as refigured for the AMT to determine whether your total amounts are less than the $20,000 threshold under the adjustment exception.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTo adjust foreign source qualified dividends, multiply the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source qualified dividends in each separate category by 0.5357 if the foreign source qualified dividends are taxed at a rate of 15%. Include the results on line 1a of the AMT\\nForm 1116.\\nIf they are taxed at a rate of 20%, multiply your foreign source qualified dividends in each separate category by 0.7143. Include the results on line 1a of the AMT Form 1116.\\nYou adjust the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source qualified dividends taxed at the 0% rate by not including them on line 1a of Form 1116. Amounts taxed at the 0% rate are on line 8 of the Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041, line 30 of Schedule D (Form 1041), or line 19 of the Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t adjust the amount of any foreign source qualified dividends you elected to include on line 4g of the AMT Form 4952.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForeign capital gains or losses.\\nIf any capital gain or loss from U.S. or foreign sources is different for the AMT, use the refigured amounts to complete this step.\\nTo figure the adjustment for the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source capital gains or losses, you must first determine whether you can use Worksheet A or Worksheet B in the Instructions for Form 1116. Otherwise, you must use the instructions for Capital Gains and Losses in Pub. 514, Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals, to figure the adjustments you must make to the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source capital gains and losses.\\nUse Worksheet A if the estate or trust has foreign source capital gains or losses in no more than two separate categories, and any of the following apply. \\n\\n\\n\\nYou weren\\'t required to make adjustments to the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source qualified dividends under the rules described earlier (or if the estate or trust had foreign source qualified dividends, you wouldn’t have been required to make those adjustments).\\n\\n\\nSchedule D (Form 1041), line 18a, column (2) or line 19, column (2), as refigured for the AMT if necessary, is zero or a loss.\\n\\n\\nOn the AMT Schedule D Tax Worksheet for Form 1041, (a) line 17a is zero, (b) line 9 is zero, or (c) line 42 is equal to or greater than line 43.\\n\\n\\nOn the AMT Part V of Schedule D (Form 1041), a) line 22 of that AMT Part V minus the amount on Form 4952, line 4e, that you elected to include on Form 4952, line 4g, is zero or less, b) line 27 of that AMT Part V of Schedule D (Form 1041) is zero, or c) line 43 of that AMT Part V is equal to or greater than line 44.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUse Worksheet B if you: \\n\\n\\n\\nCan’t use Worksheet A,\\n\\n\\nHave foreign source capital gains and losses in no more than two separate categories,\\n\\n\\nDidn’t have any item of unrecaptured section 1250 gain or any item of 28% rate gain or loss for either regular tax or AMT, and \\n\\n\\nDidn’t have any capital gains taxed at a rate of 0% or 20%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInstructions for Worksheets A and B.\\nWhen you complete Worksheet A or B, use foreign source capital gains and losses as refigured for the AMT, if necessary, and don’t use any foreign source capital gains that you elected to include on line 4g of the AMT Form 4952. If you must complete a Schedule D (Form 1041) for the AMT, use line 19 of that AMT Schedule D (Form 1041) to complete line 3 of Worksheet A or line 4 of the Line 2 Worksheet for Worksheet B. Use 0.5357 instead of the number used for regular tax to complete lines 11, 13, and 15 of Worksheet B and to complete lines 8, 11, and 17 of the Line 15 Worksheet for Worksheet B.\\nIf the estate or trust doesn\\'t qualify to use Worksheet A or Worksheet B, use the instructions for Capital Gains and Losses in Pub. 514 to determine the adjustments you make. When using the instructions in Pub. 514 to determine if you must adjust foreign source capital gains and losses, make the following substitutions.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the amount of any AMT gain is in the 15% rate group, multiply it by 0.5357 instead of the number used for regular tax.\\n\\n\\nWhen the amount of any AMT gain is in the 20% rate group, multiply it by 0.7143 instead of the number used for regular tax.\\n\\n\\nWhen the amount of any AMT gain is in the 25% rate group, multiply it by 0.8929 instead of the number used for regular tax.\\n\\n\\nWhen the amount of any AMT gain is in the 28% rate group, multiply it by 1.0 instead of the number used for regular tax.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 4.\\nComplete Part II and lines 9 through 14 of the AMT Form 1116.

Keep it for your records. Don’t file it with your tax return, unless backup withholding was reported in box 13, code B.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInconsistent Treatment of Items\\nGenerally, you must report items shown on your Schedule K-1 (including attached schedules) the same way that the estate or trust treated the items on its return.\\nIf the treatment of an item on your original or amended return is inconsistent with the estate’s or trust’s treatment (or if the estate or trust was required to but hasn\\'t filed a return), you must file Form 8082, Notice of Inconsistent Treatment or Administrative Adjustment Request (AAR), with your original or amended return to identify and explain any inconsistency (or to note that an estate or trust return hasn\\'t been filed).\\nIf you are required to file Form 8082 but fail to do so, you may be subject to the accuracy-related penalty. This penalty is in addition to any tax that results from making your amount or treatment of the item consistent with that shown on the estate’s or trust’s return. Any deficiency that results from making the amounts consistent may be assessed immediately.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nErrors\\nIf you believe the fiduciary has made an error on your Schedule K-1, notify the fiduciary and ask for an amended or a corrected Schedule K-1. Don’t change any items on your copy. Be sure that the fiduciary sends a copy of the amended Schedule K-1 to the IRS. If you are unable to reach an agreement with the fiduciary regarding the inconsistency, you must file Form 8082.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBeneficiaries of Generation-Skipping Trusts\\nIf you received Form 706-GS(D-1), Notification of Distribution From a Generation-Skipping Trust, and paid a generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax on Form 706-GS(D), Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Distributions, you can deduct the GST tax paid on income distributions on Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 6.

For more details, see Pub. 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 9—Directly Apportioned Deductions\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fiduciary must attach a statement showing depreciation, depletion, and amortization directly apportioned to you, if any, for each activity reported in boxes 5 through 8.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 10—Estate Tax Deduction (Including Certain Generation-Skipping Transfer Taxes)\\n\\n\\n\\nIf an estate or trust distributes income in respect of a decedent (IRD) to a beneficiary, the beneficiary is entitled to deduct the portion of the estate tax imposed on the decedent\\'s estate which is attributable to the IRD distributed to the beneficiary. You may claim this amount on line 16 of Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). For an example of how this amount was computed, see Regulations section 1.691(c)-2 and Pub. 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 11, Code A—Excess Deductions on Termination\\n\\n\\n\\nIf this is the final return of the estate or trust, and there are excess deductions on termination, you may be able to deduct the beneficiary’s share of the excess deductions on line 16 of Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\\n\\nNote.\\nSection 67(g) suspends miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor for tax years 2018 through 2025. See Notice 2018–61 for information about allowable beneficiary deductions under section 67(e) and 642(h). For any additional updates, please go to IRS.gov/Form1041.\\n\\nExcess deductions on termination occur only during the last tax year of the trust or decedent’s estate when the total deductions (excluding the charitable deduction and exemption) are greater than the gross income during that tax year. Only the beneficiary of an estate or trust that succeeds to its property is allowed to deduct that entity’s excess deductions on termination. A beneficiary who doesn’t have enough income in that year to absorb the entire deduction can’t carry the balance over to any succeeding year.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Box 11, Codes B and C—Unused Capital Loss Carryover\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon termination of the trust or decedent’s estate, the beneficiary succeeding to the property is allowed to deduct any unused capital loss carryover under section 1212.\\nA short-term capital loss carryover, reported as code B, is reported on Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 5.\\nA long-term capital loss carryover, reported as code C, is reported, as appropriate, on Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 12; line 5 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet for Schedule D, line 18; and line 16 of the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet for Schedule D, line 19.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n Box 11, Codes D and E—NOL Carryover\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon termination of a trust or decedent’s estate, a beneficiary succeeding to its property is allowed to deduct any unused net operating loss (NOL) if the carryover would be allowable to the trust or estate in a later tax year but for the termination. The deduction for regular tax purposes, reported as code D, is reported on Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 8.\\nA deduction for an Alternative Tax NOL (ATNOL) carryover for Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) purposes, reported as code E, is reported on Form 6251, line 2f.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBox 12—Alternative Minimum Tax Items\\n\\n\\n\\nThe information reported in box 12, codes A through I is used to prepare your Form 6251. Code A, Adjustment for minimum tax purposes, is the total amount reported on Form 6251, line 2j. Codes B through F represent the portion, if any, of the amount included in code A.\\n\\n\\nCodes B through F.\\nIf you have an amount in box 12 with code B, C, D, E, or F, see the instructions for lines 13, 14, and 15 of Form 6251.\\n\\n\\nCodes G through I.\\nInclude the amount with any of these codes on the applicable line of Form 6251.\\n\\n\\nCode J.\\nExclusion items.

In addition, you must complete Schedule D (Form 8995-A) to determine your patron reduction.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQBI items allocable to qualified payments from specified cooperatives subject to beneficiary-specific determinations.\\nThe amounts reported to you reflect your apportioned pro rata share of items from the trust or estate’s trade(s) or business(es), or aggregation(s) and include items that may not be includible in your calculation of the QBI deduction and patron reduction. When determining QBI items allocable to qualified payments you must include only qualified items that are included or allowed in determining taxable income for the tax year. To determine your QBI items allocable to qualified payments see the Instructions for Form 8995-A.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWages allocable to qualified payments from specified cooperatives.\\nThe amounts reported reflect your apportioned pro rata share of the trust or estate’s W-2 wages allocable to qualified payments of each qualified trade or business, or aggregation.

       " '\\n\\n\\nInstructions for Form 8941 (2019)\\n\\nCredit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums\\n\\n\\n\\nSection references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.\\n\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions for Form 8941 - Introductory Material\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFuture Developments\\nFor the latest information about developments related to Form 8941 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form8941.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReminders\\n\\nException for eligible small employers in certain counties.\\nCertain small employers whose principal business address is in a county with no qualified health plan through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace may be able to claim the credit for small employer health insurance premiums. For more information, see Exception for eligible small employers in certain counties in the instructions for line A.\\n\\n\\nWaiver for Hawaii.\\nEmployers in Hawaii can’t claim this credit for insurance premiums paid for health plan years beginning after 2016. For more information, see Waiver for Hawaii in the instructions for line A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPurpose of Form\\nEligible small employers (defined below) use Form 8941 to figure the credit for small employer health insurance premiums for tax years beginning after 2009. For tax years beginning after 2013, the credit is only available for a 2-consecutive-tax-year credit period. The maximum credit is generally a percentage of premiums the employer paid during the tax year for certain health insurance coverage the employer provided to certain employees enrolled in a qualified health plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace. But the credit may be reduced by limitations based on the employer’s full-time equivalent employees, average annual wages, adjusted average premiums, and state premium subsidies and tax credits.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor information about insurance plans offered through a SHOP Marketplace, visit Healthcare.gov.\\nFor tax-exempt eligible small employers, the maximum credit is 35% of premiums paid, is limited to the amount of certain payroll taxes paid, and is claimed as a refundable credit on Form 990-T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return. A tax-exempt eligible small employer is an eligible small employer described in section 501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a). A tax-exempt employer not described in section 501(c) is generally not eligible to claim this credit. However, a tax-exempt farmers’ cooperative subject to tax under section 1381 may be able to claim the credit as a general business credit, as discussed next.\\nFor all other eligible small employers, the maximum credit is 50% of premiums paid, can be taken against both regular and alternative minimum tax, and is claimed as part of the general business credit on Form 3800.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPartnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, trusts, and tax-exempt eligible small employers must file this form to claim the credit. All other taxpayers must not complete or file this form if their only source for this credit is a partnership, S corporation, cooperative, estate, or trust. Instead, they must report this credit directly on line 4h in Part III of Form 3800, General Business Credit.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEligible Small Employers\\nYou’re an eligible small employer for the tax year if you meet the following three requirements.\\n\\n1. You paid premiums for employee health insurance coverage under a qualifying arrangement.\\nA qualifying arrangement is generally an arrangement that requires you to pay a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium cost for each enrolled employee’s health insurance coverage (defined later). However, an arrangement that requires you to pay a uniform premium for each enrolled employee (composite billing) and offers different tiers of coverage (for example, employee-only, dependent, and family coverage) can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for employees not enrolled in employee-only coverage.\\nIn addition, an arrangement that requires you to pay a separate premium for each employee based on age or other factors (list billing) can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for some employees.\\nFor details, see Employer Premiums Paid, Health Insurance Coverage, and Qualifying Arrangement, later.\\n\\n\\n2. You had fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) for the tax year.\\nYou may be able to meet this requirement even if you had 25 or more employees. For details, see Worksheets 1 and 2.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAlthough the term \"eligible small employer\" is defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include employers with \"no more than\" 25 FTEs, the phaseout of the credit amount operates in such a way that an employer with exactly 25 FTEs is not in fact eligible for the credit. \\n\\n\\n3. You paid average annual wages for the tax year of less than $55,000 per FTE.\\nFor details, see Worksheets 1 and 3.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you had more than 10 FTEs and average annual wages of more than $27,000, the FTE and average annual wage limitations (discussed later) will separately reduce your credit. This may reduce your credit to zero even if you had fewer than 25 FTEs and average annual wages of less than $55,000.\\n\\nEmployers treated as a single employer.\\nTreat the following employers as a single employer to figure the credit.\\n\\n\\n\\nEmployers who are corporations in a controlled group of corporations.\\n\\n\\nEmployers who are members of an affiliated service group.\\n\\n\\nEmployers who are partnerships, proprietorships, etc., under common control. See Regulations sections 1.414(c)-2, 1.414(c)-3, and 1.414(c)-4.\\n\\n\\nTax-exempt employers under common control. See Regulations section 1.414(c)-5.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor details, see section 45R(e)(5)(A) and Regulations section 1.45R-2(b).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNo more than one Form 8941 can be filed with a tax return, unless the exception described in Example 2 below applies.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nExample 1.\\nYou’re a sole proprietor with two separate businesses and you file a separate Schedule C (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for each business. You must treat both businesses as a single employer to figure the credit. You will file one Form 8941 for both businesses.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nExample 2.\\nYou and your spouse are both sole proprietors and file a separate Schedule C (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for each of your separate businesses. Neither spouse was an employee of the other spouse or participated in the management of the other spouse’s business at any time during the tax year. No more than 50% of the gross income of either business was derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest, and annuities and you otherwise meet the requirements listed in Regulations section 1.414(c)-4(b)(5)(ii). Don’t treat both businesses as a single employer to figure the credit. If you and your spouse are both eligible small employers, you can file two Forms 8941 with a jointly filed Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCredit Period\\nFor tax years beginning after 2013, the credit period during which the credit can be claimed is a 2-consecutive-tax-year period beginning with the first tax year in which:\\n\\n\\n\\nAn eligible small employer (or any predecessor) files an income tax return with an attached Form 8941 with line A checked \"Yes\" and a positive amount on line 12, or\\n\\n\\nA tax-exempt eligible small employer (or any predecessor) files Form 990-T with an attached Form 8941 with line A checked \"Yes\" and a positive amount on line 12.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEmployer Premiums Paid\\nOnly premiums you paid for health insurance coverage under a qualifying arrangement (discussed later) for individuals considered employees are counted when figuring your credit.\\n\\nState premium subsidy or tax credit.\\nIf you’re entitled to a state tax credit or a state premium subsidy paid directly to you for premiums you paid, don’t reduce the amount you paid by the credit or subsidy amount. Also, if a state pays a premium subsidy directly to your insurance provider, treat the subsidy amount as an amount you paid for employee health insurance coverage.\\n\\n\\nWellness programs.\\nA wellness program is generally an insurance program of health promotion or disease prevention. If you pay part or all of the cost of an employee’s participation in a wellness program, use the amount you paid to figure your employer premiums paid.\\n\\n\\nTobacco surcharges.\\nA tobacco surcharge is generally an additional amount charged for insurance for a tobacco user. If you pay part or all of an employee’s tobacco surcharge, you can’t use the amount you paid to figure your employer premiums paid.\\n\\n\\nDependent coverage.\\nDependent coverage is generally coverage offered separately to an individual who is or may become eligible for coverage under the terms of a group health plan because of a relationship to a participant-employee, whether or not a dependent of the participant-employee. Dependent coverage doesn’t include coverage, such as family coverage, which includes coverage of the participant-employee. If you pay part or all of the cost of an employee’s dependent coverage, use the amount you paid to figure your employer premiums paid.\\n\\n\\nPortion of premiums paid.\\nIf you pay only a portion of the premiums and your employees pay the rest, only the portion you pay is taken into account. For this purpose, any premium paid through a salary reduction arrangement under a section 125 cafeteria plan isn’t treated as an employer paid premium. For more information on cafeteria plans, see section 1 of Pub. 15-B, Employer’s Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits.\\n\\n\\nExample 3.\\nYou offer health insurance coverage to employees under a qualifying arrangement that requires you to pay 60% of the premium cost for employee-only coverage for each employee enrolled in any health insurance coverage you provide to employees. The total premium for each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage is $5,200 per year or $100 ($5,200 ÷ 52) for each weekly payday. The total premium for each employee enrolled in family coverage is $13,000 per year or $250 ($13,000 ÷ 52) for each weekly payday.\\nEach payday you contribute $60 (60% of $100) toward the premium cost of each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage and withhold the remaining $40 from the employee\\'s paycheck to obtain the $100 total weekly premium. Each payday you contribute $60 (the same amount you pay toward the premiums of employees enrolled in employee-only coverage) toward the premium cost of each employee enrolled in family coverage and withhold the remaining $190 from the employee’s paycheck to obtain the $250 total weekly premium.\\nTo determine the premiums you paid during the tax year, multiply the number of pay periods during which the employee was enrolled in the health insurance coverage by $60. For example, you would’ve paid $3,120 ($60 × 52) for an employee who was enrolled for the entire tax year. You would’ve paid $600 ($60 × 10) for an employee who was only enrolled for 10 pay periods. You will need an additional set of calculations if the premium amounts changed during the tax year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHealth Insurance Coverage\\nFor tax years beginning after 2013, health insurance coverage generally means coverage provided to employees enrolled in a qualified health plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace. For an exception that applies to certain employers in certain counties, see the instructions for line A, later. If this exception applies, health insurance coverage means coverage, as defined under Health Insurance Coverage in the 2013 Instructions for Form 8941.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA stand-alone dental plan offered through a SHOP exchange will be considered a qualified health plan for purposes of the credit.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEmployer premiums paid for health insurance coverage can be counted in figuring the credit only if the premiums are paid under a qualifying arrangement.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQualifying Arrangement\\nA qualifying arrangement is generally an arrangement that requires you to pay a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium cost for each enrolled employee\\'s health insurance coverage (defined earlier). An arrangement that offers different tiers of coverage (for example, employee-only and family coverage) is generally a qualifying arrangement if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) separately for each tier of coverage you offer. However, an arrangement can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for some employees.\\nFor more information about the following exceptions, see Regulations section 1.45R-4.\\n\\nState or local law.\\nYou will be treated as satisfying the uniform percentage requirement if your failure to otherwise satisfy the requirement was solely attributable to additional contributions you made to certain employees to comply with state or local law.\\n\\n\\nWellness program.\\nIf a plan of an employer provides a wellness program, for purposes of meeting the uniform percentage requirement any additional amount of the employer contribution attributable to an employee’s participation in the wellness program over the employer contribution with respect to an employee that doesn’t participate in the wellness program isn’t taken into account in calculating the uniform percentage requirement, whether the difference is due to a discount for participation or a surcharge for nonparticipation. The employer contribution for employees who don’t participate in the wellness program must be at least 50% of the premium (including any premium surcharge for nonparticipation). However, for purposes of figuring the credit, the employer contributions are taken into account, including those contributions attributable to an employee’s participation in a wellness program.\\n\\n\\nTobacco surcharge.\\nAny additional amount you or your employee pay to cover a tobacco surcharge isn’t taken into account in figuring the uniform percentage requirement. Amounts you or your employee pay to cover a tobacco surcharge aren’t considered premiums paid for health insurance coverage when figuring this credit.\\n\\n\\nDependent coverage.\\nPremiums you pay for dependent coverage aren’t subject to the uniform percentage requirement. You aren’t required to pay a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) for dependent coverage. \\n\\n\\nArrangements with composite billing.\\nAn arrangement that requires you to pay a uniform premium for each enrolled employee (composite billing) and offers different tiers of coverage can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for employees not enrolled in employee-only coverage. It is a qualifying arrangement (assuming employee-only coverage is the least expensive tier of coverage) if it requires you to pay the following amounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nA uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium cost for each employee (if any) enrolled in employee-only coverage.\\n\\n\\nA uniform amount that is no less than the amount you would’ve paid toward employee-only coverage for each employee (if any) enrolled in family coverage.\\n\\n\\nA uniform amount that is no less than the amount you would’ve paid toward employee-only coverage for each employee (if any) enrolled in any other tier of coverage (figured separately for each tier).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nArrangements with list billing and only employee-only coverage.\\nAn arrangement that requires you to pay a separate premium for each employee based on age or other factors (list billing) that only provides employee-only coverage can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for some employees. It is a qualifying arrangement if it requires you to pay either of the following amounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nA uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium charged for each employee enrolled in the employee-only coverage.\\n\\n\\nA uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of your employer-computed composite rate (defined later) for your employee-only coverage for each employee enrolled in the employee-only coverage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nArrangements with list billing and other tiers of coverage.\\nAn arrangement that requires you to pay a separate premium for each employee based on age or other factors (list billing) that provides other tiers of coverage can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for some employees. It is a qualifying arrangement (assuming employee-only coverage is the least expensive tier of coverage) if it requires you to pay the following amounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nA uniform percentage (not less than 50%) for each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage, as discussed under Arrangements with list billing and only employee-only coverage above.\\n\\n\\nA uniform amount that is either equal to the amount you would’ve paid toward employee-only coverage (as discussed above), a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium charged, or a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of your employer-computed composite rate (defined below) for your family coverage, for each employee (if any) enrolled in family coverage.\\n\\n\\nA uniform amount that is either equal to the amount you would’ve paid toward employee-only coverage (as discussed above), a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium charged, or a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of your employer-computed composite rate (defined below) for any other tier of coverage, for each employee (if any) enrolled in any other tier of coverage (figured separately for each tier).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEmployer-computed composite rate.\\nThe employer-computed composite rate for a tier of coverage is the average rate determined by adding the premiums for that tier of coverage for all employees eligible to participate in the health insurance plan (whether or not they actually receive coverage under the plan or under that tier of coverage) and dividing by the total number of such eligible employees.\\n\\n\\nMore than one plan.\\nDifferent types of health insurance plans are generally not aggregated for purposes of meeting the qualifying arrangement requirement. For example, if you offer a major medical insurance plan and a stand-alone vision plan, you generally must separately satisfy the requirements for a qualifying arrangement with respect to each type of coverage. For exceptions, see Regulations section 1.45R-4(c).\\n\\n\\nState subsidies and credits.\\nFor this purpose, if you’re entitled to a state tax credit or a state premium subsidy paid directly to you for premiums you paid, don’t reduce the amount you paid by the credit or subsidy amount. Also, if a state pays a premium subsidy directly to your insurance provider, treat the subsidy amount as an amount you paid for employee health insurance coverage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nState Premium Subsidy and Tax Credit Limitation\\nYour credit may be reduced if you’re entitled to a state tax credit or a state premium subsidy for the cost of health insurance coverage you provide under a qualifying arrangement to individuals considered employees. The state tax credit may be refundable or nonrefundable and the state premium subsidy may be paid to you or directly to your insurance provider.\\nAlthough a state tax credit or premium subsidy paid directly to you doesn’t reduce the amount of your employer premiums paid, and although a state premium subsidy paid directly to an insurance provider is treated as an employer premium you paid, the amount of your credit can’t be more than your net premium payments.\\nNet premium payments are employer premiums paid (discussed earlier) minus the amount of any state tax credits you received or will receive and any state premium subsidies paid either to you or directly to your insurance provider for premiums for health insurance coverage you provide under a qualifying arrangement to individuals considered employees.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPayroll Tax Limitation for Tax-Exempt Eligible Small Employers\\nThe credit for tax-exempt eligible small employers can’t exceed the amount of certain payroll taxes. For tax years beginning in 2019, payroll taxes, for this purpose, mean only the following taxes.\\n\\n\\n\\nFederal income taxes the tax-exempt employer was required to withhold from employees’ wages in calendar year 2019.\\n\\n\\nMedicare taxes the tax-exempt employer was required to withhold from employees’ wages in calendar year 2019.\\n\\n\\nMedicare taxes the tax-exempt employer was required to pay for calendar year 2019.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPremium Deduction Reduced\\nYou must reduce your deduction for the cost of providing health insurance coverage to your employees by the amount of any credit for small employer health insurance premiums allowed with respect to the coverage.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMore Information\\nFor more information about this credit, see the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection 45R.\\n\\n\\nRegulations sections 1.45R-0 through 1.45R-5.\\n\\n\\nIRS.gov/Affordable-Care-Act/Employers/Small-Business-Health-Care-Tax-Credit-and-the-SHOP-Marketplace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPartnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, trusts, and tax-exempt eligible small employers must file this form to claim the credit.

Rules that apply to certain types of employees are discussed below.\\n\\nExcluded employees.\\nThe following individuals aren’t considered employees when you figure this credit. Hours and wages of these employees and premiums paid for them aren’t counted when you figure your credit.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe owner of a sole proprietorship.\\n\\n\\nA partner in a partnership.\\n\\n\\nA shareholder who owns (after applying the section 318 constructive ownership rules) more than 2% of an S corporation.\\n\\n\\nA shareholder who owns (after applying the section 318 constructive ownership rules) more than 5% of the outstanding stock or stock possessing more than 5% of the total combined voting power of all stock of a corporation that isn’t an S corporation.\\n\\n\\nA person who owns more than 5% of the capital or profits interest in any other business that isn’t a corporation.\\n\\n\\nFamily members or a member of the household who isn’t a family member but qualifies as a dependent on the individual income tax return of a person listed above. Family members include a child (or descendant of a child), a sibling or step-sibling, a parent (or ancestor of a parent), a step-parent, a niece or nephew, an aunt or uncle, or a son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law. A spouse of any owner or family member listed above is also considered a family member for this purpose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFormer employees.\\nPremiums paid on behalf of a former employee with no hours of service may be treated as paid on behalf of an employee for purposes of figuring the credit provided that, if so treated, the former employee is also treated as an employee for purposes of the uniform percentage requirement. \\n\\n\\nLeased employees.\\nDon’t use premiums paid by the leasing organization to figure your credit. Also, a leased employee who isn’t a common law employee is considered an employee for credit purposes if he or she does all the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nProvides services to you under an agreement between you and a leasing organization.\\n\\n\\nHas performed services for you (or for you and a related person) substantially full time for at least 1 year.\\n\\n\\nPerforms services under your primary direction or control.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut don’t use hours, wages, or premiums paid with respect to the initial year of service on which leased employee status is based.\\n\\n\\nSeasonal employees.\\nEmployees who perform labor or services on a seasonal basis and perform labor or services for you 120 or fewer days during the tax year aren’t considered employees in determining FTEs and average annual wages. But premiums paid on their behalf are counted in determining the amount of the credit. Seasonal workers include retail workers employed exclusively during holiday seasons. Seasonal workers also include workers employed exclusively during the summer.\\n\\n\\nHousehold and other nonbusiness employees.\\nHousehold employees and other employees who aren’t performing services in your trade or business are considered employees if they otherwise qualify, as discussed above. A sole proprietor must include both business and nonbusiness employees to determine FTEs, average annual wages, and premiums paid.\\n\\n\\nMinisters.\\nA minister performing services in the exercise of his or her ministry is treated as self-employed for social security and Medicare purposes. However, for credit purposes, whether a minister is an employee or self-employed is determined under the common law test for determining worker status. Self-employed ministers aren’t considered employees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nColumn (b), Employee Hours of Service\\nEnter the total hours of service for the tax year for each employee listed in column (a).

For details, see Health Insurance Coverage and Qualifying Arrangement, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nColumn (b), Employer Premiums Paid\\nEnter the total employer premiums paid for the tax year for each employee listed in column (a). For details, see Employer Premiums Paid, earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nColumn (c), Adjusted Average Premiums\\nYour credit is reduced if the employer premiums paid are more than the employer premiums that would’ve been paid if individuals considered employees were enrolled in a plan with a premium equal to the average premium for the small group market in the rating area in which the employee enrolls for coverage.\\nThe rating area in which an employee enrolls for coverage is generally the rating area where your business is located (based on your primary business address). You will generally have selected a plan in your rating area that covers all employees located within or outside your rating area. However, if you have multiple businesses or operations in multiple states, and have set up plans in more than one SHOP Marketplace, the average premiums may be different for employees enrolled in each SHOP Marketplace.\\nEnter, for each employee listed in column (a), the premiums you would’ve paid if the employee had enrolled in a plan or plans with a total premium equal to the average premium for the small group market in the rating area in which the employee enrolls for coverage.\\nTo find the average premium for the small group market in a rating area for tax years beginning in 2019, see the average premium tables at the end of these instructions. Family coverage includes any coverage other than employee-only coverage.\\n\\nExample 4.\\nAssume the same facts that were used in Example 3. The $60 you contribute each payday toward employee health insurance coverage is 60% ($60 ÷ $100) of the weekly premium for each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage and 24% ($60 ÷ $250) of the weekly premium for each employee enrolled in family coverage.\\nIn this situation, the total average premium limitation amounts that apply are 60% of the applicable average premium amounts for each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage and 24% of the applicable average premium amounts for each employee enrolled in family coverage.\\nYou have an employee enrolled in employee-only coverage who enrolled for coverage in your local rating area. The applicable employee-only average premium amount for the rating area is $4,940 or $95 ($4,940 ÷ 52) for each weekly payday. The amount you would’ve paid toward this employee’s health insurance coverage based on the average premiums is $57 (60% of $95) each payday.\\nTo determine the premiums you would’ve paid for this employee during the tax year if the employee had enrolled in an average premium plan, multiply the number of pay periods during which your employee was enrolled in the health insurance coverage by $57. For example, you would’ve paid $2,964 ($57 × 52) if the employee was enrolled for the entire tax year. You would’ve paid $570 ($57 × 10) if the employee was only enrolled for 10 pay periods. You’ll need an additional set of calculations if the premium amounts changed during the tax year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nColumn (d), Enrolled Employee Hours of Service\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t complete column (d) of Worksheet 4 if Form 8941, line 12, is zero.\\nEnter the amount from column (b) of Worksheet 1 for each employee listed in column (a) of Worksheet 4.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWorksheet 5.

       " '\\n\\n\\nInstructions for Form W-7 (09/2019)\\n\\nApplication for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (Use with the August 2019 revision of Form W-7)\\n\\n\\n\\nSection references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.\\n\\n\\n\\nRevised: 09/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions for Form W-7 - Introductory Material\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFuture Developments\\nFor the latest information about developments related to Form W-7 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/FormW7.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat’s New\\n\\nITINs for spouses and dependents who reside outside of the United States.\\nSpouses and dependents residing outside of the United States shouldn’t apply for, or renew, an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) unless they qualify for an allowable tax benefit. Examples include a dependent parent who qualifies the primary taxpayer to claim the head of household filing status, or a dependent who files his or her own tax return. The individual must be listed on an attached U.S. federal tax return with the schedule or form that applies to the allowable tax benefit. For tax years 2018 through 2025, you can’t claim a personal exemption deduction for yourself, your spouse, or your dependents.\\n\\n\\nExpiration and renewal of ITINs.\\nAn ITIN that hasn’t been included on a U.S. federal tax return at least once in the last 3 consecutive tax years will expire. In addition, ITINs that were assigned before 2013 will expire according to an annual schedule based on the middle digits of the ITIN. The middle digits refer to the fourth and fifth positions of the ITIN. For example, the middle digits for 9xx-78-xxxx are \"78.\" Expired ITINs or ITINs that are about to expire must be renewed in order to avoid delays in processing your tax return. For more information, see When To Apply, later, or visit IRS.gov/ITIN.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nITINs not used in the last 3 consecutive tax years.\\nIf your ITIN wasn’t included on a U.S. federal tax return at least once for tax years 2016, 2017, or 2018, your ITIN will expire on December 31, 2019. You need to take action to renew it if it\\'ll be included on a U.S. federal tax return. See Do You Need To Renew Your ITIN, later, for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nITINs with the middle digits \"83,\" \"84,\" \"85,\" \"86,\" and \"87\" will expire.\\nIf your ITIN’s middle digits (the fourth and fifth positions) are \"83,\" \"84,\" \"85,\" \"86,\" or \"87,\" your ITIN will remain in effect until December 31, 2019. You need to take action to renew it if it’ll be included on a U.S. federal tax return filed in 2020. See Do You Need To Renew Your ITIN, later, for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nITINs with the middle digits \"70\" through \"82\" have expired.\\nIf your ITIN’s middle digits (the fourth and fifth positions) are \"70,\" \"71,\" \"72,\" \"73,\" \"74,\" \"75,\" \"76,\" \"77,\" \"78,\" \"79,\" \"80,\" \"81,\" or \"82,\" your ITIN is expired, unless you already submitted a renewal application and it was approved. If you haven’t already renewed, you need to take action now to renew it if it’ll be included on a U.S. federal tax return. See Do You Need To Renew Your ITIN, later, for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\nDependent applicants must now specify their relationship to the U.S. citizen/resident alien.\\nAn applicant who chooses reason d must now enter the relationship he or she has to the U.S. citizen/resident alien in the designated space on Form W-7.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReminders\\n\\nThe passport isn’t a stand-alone document for certain dependents if no date of entry into the United States is present.\\nA passport that doesn’t have a date of entry won’t be accepted as a stand-alone identification document for certain dependents. See Proof of U.S. residency for applicants who are dependents under Supporting Documentation Requirements, later, for more information.\\n\\n\\nChange of address.\\nIf you move before you get your ITIN, send a letter to the IRS using the address under Where To Apply, later.\\n\\n\\nTaxpayers residing outside of the United States can apply for an ITIN through a certifying acceptance agent.\\nTaxpayers residing outside of the United States can apply for an ITIN using a certifying acceptance agent. See Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA) for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPurpose of Form\\n\\nUse Form W-7 for the following purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo apply for an ITIN. An ITIN is a nine-digit number issued by the IRS to individuals who are required for federal tax purposes to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number but who don’t have and aren’t eligible to get a social security number (SSN).\\n\\n\\nTo renew an ITIN. An ITIN only needs to be renewed if it’ll be included on a U.S. federal tax return and it’s expiring or has expired. See How To Apply, later, for more information on how to renew your ITIN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf your ITIN is only used on information returns filed with the IRS by third parties, you don’t have to renew your ITIN even if the ITIN has expired for purposes of filing a U.S. federal tax return. However, in the future, if you file an income tax return, you will need to renew your ITIN at that time.\\n\\nThe ITIN is for federal tax purposes only.\\nAn ITIN doesn’t entitle you to social security benefits and doesn’t change your immigration status or your right to work in the United States.\\n\\n\\nThe ITIN can’t be used to claim certain federal tax credits.\\nIndividuals filing tax returns using an ITIN aren’t eligible for the earned income credit (EIC). Also, a child who has an ITIN can’t be claimed as a qualifying child for purposes of the EIC. For more information, see Pub. 596, Earned Income Credit (EIC). Also, for tax years 2018 through 2025, a child who has an ITIN can’t be claimed as a qualifying child for purposes of the child tax credit and the additional child tax credit. For more information, see Pub. 972, Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents. However, you may be able to claim the credit for other dependents (ODC) for your child and other qualifying relatives (excluding your spouse) who live in the United States if they obtain an ITIN by the due date of your U.S. federal tax return (including extensions) and meet certain other requirements. See the instructions for your U.S. federal tax return for more information.\\n\\n\\nSocial security numbers.\\nDon’t complete Form W-7 if you have an SSN or if you’re eligible to get an SSN. You’re eligible for an SSN if you’re a U.S. citizen or if you’ve been admitted by the United States for permanent residence or U.S. employment.\\nTo get an SSN, see Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card. To get Form SS-5 or to find out if you’re eligible to get an SSN, go to SSA.gov or contact a Social Security Administration (SSA) office.\\nIf you have an application for an SSN pending, don’t file Form W-7. Complete Form W-7 only if the SSA notifies you that you’re ineligible for an SSN.\\nIf the SSA determines that you’re not eligible for an SSN, you must get a letter of denial and attach it to your Form W-7. This applies whether you’re attaching Form W-7 to your U.S. federal tax return or not. However, students, professors, and researchers, see information for box f, later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Is Eligible To Complete This Form\\n\\nThe following individuals are eligible to complete Form W-7.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny individual who isn’t eligible to get an SSN but who must furnish a taxpayer identification number for U.S. tax purposes or to file a U.S. federal tax return must apply for an ITIN on Form W-7. Examples include the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nA nonresident alien individual claiming reduced withholding under an applicable income tax treaty for which an ITIN is required (see Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vii)(A)). Also see Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities.\\n\\n\\nA nonresident alien individual not eligible for an SSN who is required to file a U.S. federal tax return or who is filing a U.S. federal tax return only to claim a refund.\\n\\n\\nA nonresident alien individual not eligible for an SSN who elects to file a joint U.S. federal tax return with a spouse who is a U.S. citizen or resident alien. See Pub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.\\n\\n\\nA U.S. resident alien (based on the number of days present in the United States, known as the \"substantial presence\" test) who files a U.S. federal tax return but who isn’t eligible for an SSN. For information about the substantial presence test, see Pub. 519.\\n\\n\\nA nonresident alien student, professor, or researcher who is required to file a U.S. federal tax return but who isn’t eligible for an SSN, or who is claiming an exception to the tax return filing requirement. See Pub. 519.\\n\\n\\nAn alien spouse claimed as an exemption on a U.S. federal tax return who isn’t eligible to get an SSN. See Pub. 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information, and Pub. 519.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA spouse can be claimed as an exemption only for tax years prior to 2018.\\n\\n\\nAn alien individual eligible to be claimed as a dependent on a U.S. federal tax return but who isn’t eligible to get an SSN. Your spouse is never considered your dependent. For more information about whether an alien individual is eligible to be claimed as a dependent on a U.S. federal tax return, see Pubs. 501 and 519.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDependents can be claimed as exemptions only for tax years prior to 2018.\\n\\n\\nA dependent/spouse of a nonresident alien U.S. visa holder who isn’t eligible for an SSN. See Pub. 519.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDependents and spouses can be claimed as exemptions only for tax years prior to 2018.\\n\\nNote.\\nThe deduction for personal exemptions was suspended for tax years 2018 through 2025. For tax years beginning after 2017, spouses or dependents residing outside of the United States aren’t eligible for an ITIN, unless they qualify for an allowable tax benefit. The individual must be listed on an attached U.S. federal tax return with the schedule or form that applies to the allowable tax benefit. See the instructions for your U.S. federal tax return for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersons who must renew their ITIN to file a U.S. federal tax return. See Renewal of an existing ITIN under How To Apply, and Do You Need To Renew Your ITIN, later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAdditional Information\\nFor more information, visit IRS.gov/ITIN.\\n\\nPublications.\\nSee Pubs. 501, 515, 519, and 1915 for more information.\\nYou can visit IRS.gov/Forms to download these publications as well as other forms at no cost. Otherwise, you can go to IRS.gov/OrderForms to order current and prior-year forms and instructions. Your order will be mailed to you within 10 business days. You also can call 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676) if you’re in the United States to order forms and publications.\\n\\n\\nTelephone help.\\nIf, after reading these instructions and our free publications, you’re not sure how to complete your application or have additional questions, call 800-829-1040 if you’re in the United States. If you’re outside of the United States, call 267-941-1000 (not a toll-free number) for assistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSupporting Documentation Requirements\\nThe documentation you provide must meet the following requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou must submit documentation to establish your identity and your connection to a foreign country (\"foreign status\"). Applicants claimed as dependents must also prove U.S. residency unless the applicant is from Canada or Mexico or the applicant is a dependent of U.S. military personnel stationed overseas.\\n\\n\\nYou must submit original documents, or certified copies of these documents from the issuing agency, that support the information provided on Form W-7. A certified document is one that the original issuing agency provides and certifies as an exact copy of the original document and contains an official stamped seal from the agency. You may be able to request a certified copy of documents at an embassy or consulate. However, services may vary between countries, so it’s recommended that you contact the appropriate consulate or embassy for specific information.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOriginal documents you submit will be returned to you at the mailing address shown on your Form W-7. You don’t need to provide a return envelope. Applicants are permitted to include a prepaid Express Mail or courier envelope for faster return delivery of their documents and to ensure the secure delivery of valuable documents, such as passports. The IRS will then return the documents in the envelope provided by the applicant. If your original documents aren’t returned within 60 days, you can call the IRS (see Telephone help, earlier). If you will need your documents for any purpose within 60 days of submitting your ITIN application, you may wish to apply in person at an IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center or a CAA. See Where To Apply, later.\\n\\n\\nThe documentation you provide must be current (that is, not expired).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThere are 13 acceptable documents, as shown in the following table. At least one document must contain your photograph, unless you’re a dependent under age 14 (under age 18 if a student). You may later be required by the IRS to provide a certified translation of foreign-language documents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupporting Documentation\\nCan be used to establish:\\n\\n\\nForeign status\\nIdentity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPassport (the only stand-alone document*)\\nx\\nx\\n\\n\\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) photo identification\\nx\\nx\\n\\n\\nVisa issued by the U.S. Department of State\\nx\\nx\\n\\n\\nU.S. driver’s license\\n\\xa0\\nx\\n\\n\\nU.S. military identification card\\n\\xa0\\nx\\n\\n\\nForeign driver’s license\\n\\xa0\\nx\\n\\n\\nForeign military identification card\\nx\\nx\\n\\n\\nNational identification card (must contain name, photograph, address, date of birth, and expiration date)\\nx\\nx\\n\\n\\nU.S. state identification card\\n\\xa0\\nx\\n\\n\\nForeign voter’s registration card\\nx\\nx\\n\\n\\nCivil birth certificate\\nx**\\nx\\n\\n\\nMedical records (valid only for dependents under age 6)\\nx**\\nx\\n\\n\\nSchool records (valid only for a dependent under age 18, if a student)\\nx**\\nx\\n\\n\\n* Applicants claimed as dependents who need to prove U.S. residency must provide additional original documentation if the passport doesn’t have a date of entry into the United States. See Proof of U.S. residency for applicants who are dependents below.\\n\\t\\t\\t** May be used to establish foreign status only if documents are foreign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you submit an original valid passport or a certified copy from the issuing agency, you don’t need to submit any other documents from the table, unless the passport is for a dependent and it doesn’t include a date of entry into the United States.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nProof of U.S. residency for applicants who are dependents.\\nA passport that doesn’t have a date of entry won’t be accepted as a stand-alone identification document for dependents, unless they are dependents of U.S. military personnel stationed overseas. In these cases, applicants will be required to submit at least one of the following original documents in addition to the passport to prove U.S. residency.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf under 6 years of age: A U.S. medical record, school record, or U.S. state identification card that lists the applicant’s name and U.S. address, or a U.S. visa.\\n\\n\\nIf at least 6 years of age but under 18 years of age: A U.S. school record, U.S. state identification card, or driver’s license that lists the applicant’s name and U.S. address, or a U.S. visa.\\n\\n\\nIf 18 years of age or older: A U.S. school record, rental statement from a U.S. property, utility bill for a U.S. property, or a bank statement, U.S. state identification card or driver’s license that lists the applicant’s name and U.S. address, or a U.S. visa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNote.\\nApplicants claimed as dependents on prior-year returns also must prove U.S. residency if the passport doesn’t have a date of entry, unless the applicant is from Canada or Mexico or is a dependent of U.S. military personnel stationed overseas. In these cases, applicants will be required to submit at least one of the original documents from the list earlier in addition to the passport to prove U.S. residency.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you check box d for a dependent of a U.S. citizen or resident alien, then you may submit an original valid passport (or a certified copy from the issuing agency) without any other documents to prove your \"foreign status\" or \"identity\" only if the passport has a U.S. date of entry. Otherwise, you must submit one of the additional documents listed earlier with your passport to prove residency. If you don’t have one of the additional documents listed earlier to submit with your passport, you can’t use your passport as a stand-alone supporting document and must submit at least two types of documents listed in the \"Supporting Documentation\" table that prove residency, identity, and foreign status, and that meet the photograph requirement explained earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAdditional Documentation Requirements\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCivil birth certificate.\\nAn original birth certificate is required if the applicant is under age 18 and hasn’t provided a valid passport. Civil birth certificates are considered current at all times because they don’t contain an expiration date.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPassports and national identification cards.\\nThese documents will be considered current only if their expiration date hasn’t passed prior to the date the Form W-7 is submitted.\\n\\nNote.\\nCertified copies of a passport from the issuing agency must include the U.S. visa pages if a visa is required for your Form W-7 application.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMedical records.\\nMedical records will be accepted for dependents under 6 years of age. The medical record must contain the child’s name, date of birth, and verifiable address. Shot/immunization records will be accepted only if they document the applicant’s name and chronological dates of the applicant’s medical history and care. In addition, the medical record must document the name, address, and phone number of the doctor, hospital, or clinic where treatment was last administered. If this information isn’t printed on the medical record, the medical record must be accompanied by a dated letter providing the required information on official letterhead from the federal authority, physician, hospital, or clinic that administered the latest care of the child. The medical record must be dated no more than 12 months from the date of the Form W-7 application. If the passport doesn’t have a date of entry into the United States, the medical record must be from a U.S. facility, unless the applicant is a dependent of U.S. military personnel stationed overseas or the applicant is a resident of Canada or Mexico, if claimed for tax years prior to 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSchool records.\\nSchool records will be accepted only if they are for a school term ending no more than 12 months from the date of the Form W-7 application. The school record must consist of an official report card or transcript issued by the school or the equivalent of a Ministry of Education. The school record also must be signed by a school official or ministry official. The record must be dated and contain the student’s name, coursework with grades (unless under age 6), date of grading period(s) (unless under age 6), and school name and address. If the passport doesn’t have a date of entry into the United States, the school record must be from a U.S. facility, unless the applicant is a dependent of U.S. military personnel stationed overseas or the applicant is a resident of Canada or Mexico and is either claimed for tax years prior to 2018 or claimed for the American opportunity tax credit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow To Apply\\nFollow the guidelines below if you’re applying for a new ITIN or renewing an existing ITIN. To determine if you need to renew your ITIN, see Do You Need To Renew Your ITIN, later.\\n\\nNote.\\nKeep a copy of your application for your records.\\n\\n\\nApplying for an ITIN for the first time.\\nIf you’ve never had an ITIN before and are submitting an application for a new ITIN, include the following in your application package.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNote.\\nIf you submit a Form W-7, all future ITIN notices and correspondence that you receive will be in English. If you prefer to receive them in Spanish, submit Form W-7(SP).\\n\\n\\n\\nYour completed Form W-7.\\n\\n\\nYour original tax return(s) for which the ITIN is needed. Attach Form W-7 to the front of your tax return. If you’re applying for more than one ITIN for the same tax return (such as for a spouse or dependent(s)), attach all Forms W-7 to the same tax return. Leave the area of the SSN blank on the tax return for each person who is applying for an ITIN. After your Form W-7 has been processed, the IRS will assign an ITIN to the return and process the return.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThere are exceptions to the requirement to include a U.S. federal tax return. If you claim one of these exceptions, you must submit the documentation required instead of a tax return. See Exceptions Tables, later.\\n\\n\\nOriginal documents, or certified copies of these documents from the issuing agency, required to support the information provided on Form W-7. The required supporting documentation must be consistent with the applicant’s information provided on Form W-7. For example, the name, date of birth, and country(ies) of citizenship shown in the documentation must be the same as on Form W-7, lines 1a, 4, and 6a. See Supporting Documentation Requirements, earlier, for a list of the documents that can be submitted along with your application package.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nRenewal of an existing ITIN.\\nIf your ITIN is expiring or has expired and the ITIN will be included on a U.S. federal tax return, follow the guidelines below to submit your renewal application. Applications for renewal may be filed immediately. If your ITIN won’t be included on a U.S. federal tax return, you don’t need to renew your ITIN at this time.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you don’t renew the expired ITIN and you file a U.S. federal tax return with the expired ITIN, there may be a delay in processing your tax return. \\nInclude the following in your renewal application package. \\n\\n\\n\\nYour completed Form W-7. You must check a box to indicate the reason you’re completing Form W-7 even if you’re applying to renew your ITIN.\\n\\n\\nOriginal documentation, or certified copies of the documentation from the issuing agency, required to support the information provided on Form W-7. The required supporting documentation must be consistent with the applicant’s information provided on Form W-7. For example, the name, date of birth, and country(ies) of citizenship shown in the documentation must be the same as on Form W-7, lines 1a, 4, and 6a. See Supporting Documentation Requirements, earlier, for a list of the documents that can be submitted along with your renewal package.\\nAll family members listed on a tax return may renew their ITINs at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSpouses and dependents who reside outside of the United States and renew their ITIN to claim an allowable tax benefit must be listed on an attached U.S. federal tax return with the schedule or form that applies to the allowable benefit.\\n\\nCertified copies.\\nYou can submit copies of original documents if you do any of the following.\\n\\n\\n\\nHave the copies certified by the issuing agency.\\n\\n\\nHave the officers at U.S. embassies and consulates overseas provide certification and authentication services. Contact the Consular Section, American Citizens Services of the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in advance to determine the hours of operation for these services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nDeceased taxpayers.\\nWhen requesting an ITIN for a deceased taxpayer, the deceased must meet all of the requirements established to get an ITIN. Also, you must write \"Deceased\" across the top of Form W-7 and include the documentation shown in the following chart.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIF you’re:\\nTHEN you must include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe surviving spouse filing an original or amended joint return with your deceased spouse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForm W-7,\\n\\n\\nA U.S. individual income tax return, and\\n\\n\\nDocumentation substantiating the identity and foreign status of the deceased.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe court-appointed executor or administrator of the deceased’s estate filing an original tax return on behalf of the deceased\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForm W-7,\\n\\n\\nA U.S. individual income tax return,\\n\\n\\nDocumentation substantiating the identity and foreign status of the deceased*, and\\n\\n\\nA court certificate showing your appointment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeither the surviving spouse nor the court-appointed executor or administrator of the deceased’s estate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForm W-7,\\n\\n\\nA U.S. individual income tax return,\\n\\n\\nDocumentation substantiating the identity and foreign status of the deceased*,\\n\\n\\nForm 1310 (if a refund is due), and\\n\\n\\nA copy of the certificate of death.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* If Form W-7 is for a deceased individual under 18 years of age, one of the documents proving identity, foreign status, and/or U.S. residency must be a birth certificate, unless a passport with a date of entry into the United States is submitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nITIN not needed for Forms 4868, 1040-ES, or 1040-ES (NR).\\nIf you’re filing an application for an extension of time to file using Form 4868, or making an estimated tax payment using Form 1040-ES or Form 1040-ES (NR), don’t file Form W-7 with those forms. Enter \"ITIN TO BE REQUESTED\" wherever your SSN or ITIN is requested. An ITIN will be issued only after you file a tax return and meet all other requirements.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you attached your tax return to your Form W-7, leave the area of the SSN blank on the tax return for each person who is applying for an ITIN.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen To Apply\\n\\nFirst-time ITIN applications.\\nIf you’re applying for a new ITIN, complete and attach Form W-7 to your tax return when you file the tax return for which the ITIN is needed. If you’re unable to file your tax return by the due date, you must file an application for an extension of time to file. Failure to timely file the tax return with a complete Form W-7 and required documentation may result in the denial of refundable credits, such as the additional child tax credit (available for tax years prior to 2018) and the American opportunity tax credit, if you otherwise qualify. Don’t file your tax return without Form W-7.\\nIf you meet one of the exceptions described in Exceptions Tables at the end of these instructions, you may complete and submit Form W-7 at any time.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou can’t electronically file (e-file) a return using an ITIN in the calendar year the ITIN is assigned. If you need to file multiple-year returns, you can attach them all to your Form W-7 and submit them to the IRS. Once your ITIN is assigned, you can e-file returns in the following years. For example, if you apply for and receive an ITIN in 2020, you may not e-file any tax return using that ITIN (including prior-year returns) until 2021.\\n\\nRenewal ITIN applications.\\nIf you’re renewing an existing ITIN, you may submit your Form W-7 renewal application (without filing a tax return) immediately. If you don’t renew your expired ITIN and you file a U.S. federal tax return with the expired ITIN, there may be a delay in processing your tax return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhere To Apply\\n\\nBy mail.\\nMail Form W-7, your tax return (if applicable) or other documents required by an exception, and the documentation described under Supporting Documentation Requirements, earlier, to:\\nInternal Revenue Service\\nITIN Operation\\nP.O.

Interregional, Hwy 35\\nAustin, TX 78741-0000\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn person.\\nYou can apply for your ITIN by visiting designated IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs). They can verify original documentation and certified copies of the documentation from the issuing agency for primary and secondary applicants and their dependents. For dependents, TACs can verify passports, national identification cards, and birth certificates. These documents will be returned to you immediately. Service at TACs is by appointment only. Appointments can be scheduled by calling 844-545-5640. See  IRS.gov/W7DocumentVerification for a list of designated TACs that offer ITIN document authentication service. TACs that don’t offer ITIN document authentication service will mail the original documents, Form W-7, and the tax return to the IRS Austin Service Center for processing.\\n\\n\\nThrough an acceptance agent.\\nYou also can apply through one of the two types of acceptance agents authorized by the IRS.\\n\\n\\n\\nAcceptance Agent (AA).\\n\\n\\nCertifying Acceptance Agent (CAA).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAcceptance Agent (AA).\\nAn Acceptance Agent (AA) can help you complete and file Form W-7. To get a list of agents, visit IRS.gov and enter \"acceptance agent program\" in the search box. An AA will need to submit original documentation or certified copies of the documentation from the issuing agency to the IRS for all applicants.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCertifying Acceptance Agent (CAA).\\nA Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA) can verify original documentation and certified copies of the documentation from the issuing agency for primary and secondary applicants and their dependents. For dependents, CAAs can only verify passports and birth certificates. The CAA will return the documentation immediately after reviewing its authenticity. Taxpayers residing outside of the United States can apply for an ITIN through a CAA.\\n\\n\\n\\nProcessing times.\\nAllow 7 weeks for the IRS to notify you of your ITIN application status (9 to 11 weeks if you submit the application during peak processing periods (January 15 through April 30) or if you’re filing from overseas). If you haven’t received your ITIN or correspondence at the end of that time, you can call the IRS to find out the status of your application (see Telephone help, earlier).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDo You Need To Renew Your ITIN?\\n\\nDo You Need To Renew Your ITIN?\\nDo You Need To Renew Your ITIN?\\nSummary: Follow the steps in the flowchart to see if you need to renew your ITIN.\\nCaution: If the ITIN is being renewed for a spouse or dependent who resides outside of the United States, see \"ITINs for spouses and dependents who reside outside of the United States\" under \"What\\'s New\".\\nStart\\nThis is the start of the flowchart.\\nDecision (1)\\nDo you have an SSN or are you eligible for an SSN?\\n\\n\\n\\nIF Yes continue to Process (a).\\n\\n\\nIF No continue to Decision (2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDecision (2)\\nIs the ITIN only being used on information returns filed with the IRS by third parties (such as Form 1099)?\\n\\n\\n\\nIF Yes continue to Process (b).\\n\\n\\nIF No continue to Decision (3).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDecision (3)\\nWill you file a U.S. federal tax return using the ITIN (or will the ITIN be used for a spouse or dependent on a U.S. federal tax return)?\\n\\n\\n\\nIF Yes continue to Decision (4).\\n\\n\\nIF No continue to Process (c).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDecision (4)\\nAre the middle digits of your ITIN \"70,\" \"71,\" \"72,\" \"73,\" \"74,\" \"75,\" \"76,\" \"77,\" \"78,\" \"79,\" \"80,\" \"81,\" or \"82\"?\\n\\n\\n\\nIF Yes continue to Process (d).\\n\\n\\nIF No continue to Decision (5).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDecision (5)\\nAre the middle digits of your ITIN \"83,\" \"84,\" \"85,\" \"86,\" or \"87\"?\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIF Yes continue to Process (d).\\n\\n\\nIF No continue to Decision (6).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDecision (6)\\nHave you filed a U.S. federal tax return using the ITIN (or was the ITIN used for a spouse or dependent) for tax year 2016, 2017, or 2018?\\n\\n\\n\\nIF Yes continue to Process (e).\\n\\n\\nIF No continue to Process (d).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nProcess (a)\\nYou don’t need to renew your ITIN.

Describe in detail your reason for requesting an ITIN and attach supporting documents.\\nFrequently, third parties (such as banks and other financial institutions) that are subject to information-reporting and withholding requirements will request an ITIN from you to enable them to file information returns required by law. If you’re requesting an ITIN for this reason, you may be able to claim one of the exceptions described later. Enter on the dotted line next to box h the exception that applies to you. Identify the exception by its number, alpha subsection (if applicable), and category under which you’re applying (for example, enter \"Exception 1a-Partnership Income\" or \"Exception 3-Mortgage Interest\").

Also, don\\'t use Form W-7A if the child isn\\'t a U.S. citizen or resident alien. Use Form W-7 instead.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat Is an ATIN\\nAn ATIN is a temporary nine-digit number issued by the IRS to individuals who are in the process of legally adopting a U.S. citizen or resident alien child but who can’t get an SSN for that child in time to file their tax return.\\nYou may be able to use an ATIN on your tax return to take the following benefits based on the child.\\n\\n\\n\\nDependency exemption. See Pub. 501.\\n\\n\\nCredit for child and dependent care expenses. See Pub. 503.\\n\\n\\nAdoption Credit. See the Instructions for Form 8839.\\n\\n\\nChild tax credit. See Pub. 972.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHowever, you can’t use an ATIN to claim the earned income credit (EIC).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you must identify a qualifying child by an ATIN to claim the child tax credit or additional child tax credit, you must get the ATIN before the due date of your return (including extensions); otherwise, you can’t claim these credits for the child needing an ATIN on either your original or an amended return for that year, even if you later get an ATIN.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow Long Can You Use an ATIN\\nAn ATIN issued to you for your adoptive child will expire 2 years from the date it is issued. You will receive a notice from the IRS 3 months before the expiration date to remind you that the ATIN will expire. The notice will explain how you can apply for an extension if the adoption will not be final by the expiration date.\\nAfter the adoption is final, don’t continue using the ATIN. Instead, you must use an SSN. To apply for an SSN for the child, fill in Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, and return it, with the appropriate evidence documents, to the Social Security Administration (SSA). You can get Form SS-5 online at SSA.gov, from your local SSA office, or by calling the SSA at 1-800-772-1213. It usually takes about 2 weeks to get an SSN once the SSA has all the evidence and information it needs.\\n\\nApplication for SSN denied.\\nIf the SSA denies your application for an SSN, contact the IRS to request an extension or reactivation of the ATIN. When you request the extension or reactivation of the ATIN, include the SSA’s denial letter or an explanation with your correspondence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must File\\nFile Form W-7A if all of the following apply.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have a child living with you who was placed in your home for legal adoption by an authorized placement agency.\\n\\n\\nYou can’t obtain the child’s existing SSN even though you have made a reasonable attempt to obtain it from the birth parents, the placement agency, and other persons.\\n\\n\\nYou can’t obtain an SSN for the child from the SSA because, for example, the adoption isn’t final.\\n\\n\\nYou are eligible to claim the child as a dependent on your tax return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDon’t file Form W-7A if the child isn’t a U.S. citizen or resident alien. Instead, apply for an ITIN using Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow To File\\nYour must complete Form W-7A at least 4 to 8 weeks before you will need an ATIN. Sign and date the application and mail it to the address under Where To File. Be sure to include the required attachments (see What To Include With Form W-7A).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat To Include With Form W-7A\\nYou must attach signed and dated documentation to Form W-7A to prove the child was placed with you for legal adoption (not for foster care) by an authorized placement agency.\\nIn general, one of the following documents will satisfy this requirement.\\n\\n\\n\\nA copy of the placement agreement entered into between you and an authorized placement agency.\\n\\n\\nA copy of the document signed by a hospital official authorizing the release of a newborn child from the hospital to you for legal adoption.\\n\\n\\nA copy of the court order or other court document ordering or approving the placement of a child with you for legal adoption.\\n\\n\\nAn affidavit signed by the adoption attorney or government official who placed the child with you for legal adoption pursuant to state law.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nForeign adoptions.\\nIn addition, if you adopt a foreign child with U.S. citizenship or resident alien status, include with your Form W-7A a copy of your child’s:\\n\\n\\n\\nPermanent resident card (green card),\\n\\n\\nCertificate of Citizenship, or\\n\\n\\nPassport with \"I-551\" stamp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf the adoption of the foreign child is final, but you are unable to get an SSN for your child, see Application for SSN denied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhere To File\\n\\xa0\\nDepartment of the Treasury\\nInternal Revenue Service\\nStop 6182\\nAustin, TX 73301-0066\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen To Expect the ATIN\\nIt usually takes 4–8 weeks to get an ATIN.

The Internal Revenue Code sections 23, 137, 6011, and 6109 require that you furnish an identifying number on your tax return if you are claiming certain tax benefits during the process of adopting a U.S. citizen or resident alien child and cannot get an SSN for that child until the adoption is final. Form W-7A must be used to apply for the identification number, an ATIN. Section 6109 requires that you disclose your taxpayer identification number (SSN). Routine uses of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their tax laws. We may also disclose this information to other countries under a tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce federal nontax criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. If you do not file this form, you will not be issued an ATIN.\\nYou are required to give us this information.

Books or records relating to a form or its instructions must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any Internal Revenue law. Generally, tax returns and return information are confidential, as required by Internal Revenue Code section 6103.\\nThe average time and expenses required to complete and file this form will vary depending on individual circumstances.

Among other things, the final and temporary regulations under chapters 3 and 4 modified certain requirements with respect to the collection of Forms W-8, the contents of the forms, their validity periods, and the due diligence requirements of withholding agents. Forms W-8 (and their instructions) were updated in June and July 2017, generally to reflect the amendments to the regulations under chapters 3 and 4.\\nOn January 24, 2017, the Treasury Department and the IRS finalized certain regulations under sections 871(m) and 1441 (TD 9815) and published temporary regulations under section 871(m) to supplement certain provisions of those final regulations. Among other things, the final and temporary regulations under sections 871(m) and 1441 modified the rules for withholding and reporting certain payments made to qualified derivative dealers (QDDs). The Treasury Department and the IRS also issued Notice 2017-42, 2017-34 I.R.B. 212, which announced certain intended amendments to the regulations, such as delaying until 2019 withholding under chapters 3 and 4 on dividends paid to a QDD in its equity derivatives dealer capacity.\\nThe transition rules related to the Qualified Securities Lender (QSL) regime described in Notice 2010-46, 2010-24 I.R.B. 757, have been extended to include payments made in calendar years 2018 and 2019. See Notice 2018-05, 2018-6 I.R.B. 341. Therefore, withholding agents may accept and rely on a valid Form W-8IMY on which an entity represents its chapter 3 status as a QSL until December 31, 2019.\\nIn addition, on September 25, 2017, the Treasury Department and the IRS released Notice 2017-46, 2017-41 I.R.B. 275, providing revised guidance for certain withholding agents to obtain and report taxpayer identification numbers and dates of birth of their account holders and on March 5, 2018, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued supplemental guideline in Notice 2018-20, 2018-12 I.R.B. 444. See Foreign TINs and Notes for Validating Form W-8BEN-E, later, for the revised requirements for certain withholding agents to obtain on Form W-8 an account holder’s foreign TIN and, for an individual, date of birth.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPurpose of Instructions\\nThese instructions supplement the instructions for the forms listed below and provide notes to assist withholding agents and foreign financial institutions (FFIs) in validating the forms for chapters 3 and 4 purposes. These instructions also outline the due diligence requirements applicable to withholding agents for establishing a beneficial owner’s foreign status and claim for reduced withholding under an income tax treaty. These instructions are not inclusive of all requirements that may apply to a withholding agent for validating Forms W-8. A withholding agent should also reference the applicable regulations under chapters 3 and 4 and the instructions for each Form W-8 listed below.\\n\\n\\n\\nForm W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals).\\n\\n\\nForm W-BEN-E, Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities).\\n\\n\\nForm W-8ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States.\\n\\n\\nForm W-8EXP, Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting.\\n\\n\\nForm W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor definitions of terms not defined in these instructions, see the Forms W-8 and their accompanying instructions.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThroughout these instructions, a reference to or mention of \"Form W-8\" includes Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.\\nThese instructions reflect the regulatory changes described earlier that are relevant to Forms W-8 and certain other changes reflected on the most current revisions to the Form W-8 series published as of the date of publication of these instructions. Thus, different rules may apply to withholding agents with respect to prior revisions of Forms W-8 for which these regulatory changes did not yet apply, and different requirements may apply to future revisions of these forms. See Requesting Prior Versions of Form W-8, later, including the limitations on such use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Is a Withholding Agent?\\n\\nAny person, U.S. or foreign, in whatever capacity acting, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of an amount subject to withholding for chapter 3 purposes or a withholdable payment for chapter 4 purposes is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, or U.S. branch of certain foreign banks and insurance companies. If several persons qualify as withholding agents for a single payment, the tax required to be withheld must only be withheld once. Generally, the person who pays (or causes to be paid) an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3 or a withholdable payment to the foreign person (or to its agent) must withhold. See the Instructions for Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons, and Form 1042-S, Foreign Person\\'s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding, for return filing and information reporting obligations with respect to payments made to foreign persons.\\nFor effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) allocable to a foreign partner, the partnership is generally the withholding agent and must file Form 8804, Annual Return for Partnership Withholding Tax (Section 1446); Form 8805, Foreign Partner\\'s Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax; and Form 8813, Partnership Withholding Tax Payment Voucher (Section 1446).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nResponsibilities of a Withholding Agent To Obtain Form W-8\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nChapter 3 Responsibilities (Other Than Section 1446)\\nGenerally, an amount is subject to withholding for purposes of chapter 3 if it is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (and original issue discount (OID)), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums) or items of income excluded from gross income without regard to the U.S. or foreign status of the owner of the income, such as interest under section 103(a). Amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding do not include amounts that are not FDAP as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short term OID).\\nFor purposes of sections 1441 and 1442, if you are a withholding agent, you must withhold 30% of any payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding made to a payee that is a foreign person unless you can reliably associate the payment with documentation (for example, Form W-8 or Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) upon which you can rely to treat the payment as made to (a) a payee that is a U.S. person or (b) a beneficial owner that is a foreign person entitled to a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding. In certain circumstances, however, you may be allowed to associate a payment with documentary evidence rather than a Form W-8 for a payment made outside the United States with respect to an offshore obligation under Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1). A withholding agent must also withhold under section 1443 on certain payments to foreign tax-exempt organizations that are unrelated business taxable income or subject to the 4% excise tax imposed by section 4948.\\nHowever, a withholding agent making a payment to a foreign person need not withhold under chapter 3 if the foreign person assumes responsibility for withholding on the payment as a qualified intermediary (QI) (other than a QI that is acting as a QDD for payments with respect to underlying securities that are subject to withholding), or if the foreign person is a withholding foreign partnership (WP), or a withholding foreign trust (WT) that has provided a valid Form W-8IMY certifying to such status. For 2017 and 2018, however, a withholding agent is not required to withhold on dividends paid to a QI acting as a QDD. Withholding under chapter 3 is also not required if the payment is made to a U.S. branch of a foreign insurance company or foreign bank or a territory financial institution that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person under the requirements of Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) and provides a valid Form W-8IMY certifying to such status.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nChapter 4 Responsibilities\\nFor purposes of chapter 4, if you are a withholding agent, you must withhold 30% of any payment that is a withholdable payment (as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)) made to a nonparticipating FFI that is not an exempt beneficial owner or to a non-financial foreign entity (NFFE) that is not an excepted NFFE and does not disclose its substantial U.S. owners (or certify that it has no substantial U.S. owners). In addition, if you are a withholding agent and also a participating FFI, you must withhold to the extent required under Regulations section 1.1471-4(b) and the FFI agreement, which, in addition to the requirements described in the previous sentence, require withholding on withholdable payments made to recalcitrant account holders.\\nYou must determine if a payment is a withholdable payment without regard to any exceptions from withholding applicable under chapter 3. For each such withholdable payment, you must obtain a Form W-8 (or other documentation permitted under Regulations section 1.1471-3(d)) upon which you are permitted to rely under chapter 4 to determine the chapter 4 status of a payee that is a foreign person for purposes of whether withholding applies under chapter 4. Thus, a determination of whether a Form W-8 is valid for purposes of providing an exemption from chapter 4 withholding is a separate determination from whether the Form W-8 may be relied upon to provide an exemption from (or reduction in) withholding under chapter 3. For purposes of determining whether withholding under chapter 4 applies to a payment to a QI, WP, or WT, the exceptions in chapter 3 for QIs, WPs, and WTs will apply, provided the entity includes its chapter 4 status on Form W-8IMY. See also Notes for Validating Form W-8IMY under Form W-8IMY, later, for the requirements for withholdable payments made to certain U.S. branches that act as intermediaries.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSection 1446 Responsibilities\\nGenerally, under section 1446, a partnership that allocates ECTI to a foreign partner must withhold at the highest tax rate applicable to that person for the type of income allocated (for example, ordinary income or capital gains) in accordance with the provisions of Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6. Unless the partnership is a publicly traded partnership, the partnership must withhold in the year the ECTI is allocable to the foreign partner, rather than the year in which the distribution is made. The partnership may rely on documentation (for example, Form W-8 or Form W-9) to determine if the partner is foreign or domestic and the type of partner (for example, individual or corporate) and whether the partner qualifies for certain tax preferential rates (for example, capital gains and collectibles). The documentation must contain a U.S. TIN for the partner. Generally, a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership that submits a Form W-8 for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will satisfy the documentation requirements under section 1446. However, a partnership that knows or has reason to know that the documentation provided is incorrect or unreliable must presume the partner is foreign. Additionally, a partnership may rely on other means to determine the non-foreign status of a partner, but will only be protected from liability (including penalties) if such determination is correct. A partnership is in no event required to rely on other means to determine the non-foreign status of a partner and may demand that the partner provide an acceptable certificate (for example, a Form W-8BEN).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOther Uses of Form W-8\\n\\xa0\\n\\nChapter 61 and section 3406.\\nThe Form W-8 you collect may also be used to establish a person\\'s status for purposes of domestic information reporting under chapter 61 and backup withholding under section 3406, including for a payment settlement entity to determine whether a participating payee is a foreign person for purposes of section 6050W. In general, if you receive a Form W-8 that you can reliably associate with the payment, you are exempt from reporting the payment on a Form 1099 and withholding under section 3406. \\n\\n\\nFFI documenting account holders.\\nIf you are an FFI maintaining a financial account, you may be required to perform due diligence procedures to identify and document the account holder under the chapter 4 regulations or an applicable intergovernmental agreement (IGA) even if you are not making a payment to the account holder that is subject to withholding. You may use Form W-8 to document the chapter 4 status of an account holder and to validate a claim of foreign status made by the account holder, such as when the account has certain U.S. indicia. For example, a participating FFI may treat an individual account holder claiming foreign status that has U.S. indicia (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(B)) as a foreign person for purposes of the FFI’s U.S. account reporting requirements (that is, Form 8966) when the individual provides a Form W-8BEN and certain documentary evidence establishing foreign status. \\nIf you are an FFI documenting an account holder of an account that you determine is excepted as a financial account under Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2), a Form W-8 (or other permitted documentation for chapter 4 purposes) is not required unless the form is associated with amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3. In such a case, a valid chapter 4 status (including that the account is not a financial account) is not required to be provided on the form.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRequesting Form W-8\\n\\nGenerally, if you are making a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment, you must withhold as required at the 30% rate under chapter 3 or 4 unless you can reliably associate the payment with a Form W-8 or other permitted documentation to permit withholding at a reduced rate or an exemption from withholding. You can reliably associate a payment with a Form W-8 if you hold a valid form that contains the information required for purposes of chapter 3 or 4 (as applicable), you can reliably determine how much of the payment relates to the form, and you may rely upon the form under the due diligence requirements. See Due Diligence Requirements in General, later.\\nYou should request a Form W-8 from any person to whom you are making a payment that you believe to be a foreign person. You should request the form before making a payment so that you have the form when you make the payment. See, however, Regulations sections 1.1441-1(b)(7)(ii) and 1.1471-3(c)(7)(ii) for when you may be able to rely on a Form W-8 obtained after the date of a payment to support reduced withholding for chapter 3 or 4 purposes.\\nA withholding agent or payor that fails to obtain a valid Form W-8 or Form W-9 and fails to withhold as required under the presumption rules may be assessed tax at the 30% rate under chapter 3 or 4 or the 28% backup withholding rate under section 3406, as well as interest and penalties for lack of compliance. If you are a partnership allocating income that is effectively connected with the conduct of the partnership’s U.S. trade or business and you fail to withhold as required under section 1446, you will be liable for the tax required to be withheld. In addition, you may be liable for interest, penalties, and additions to the tax even if there is no underlying tax liability due from a foreign partner on its allocable share of the partnership’s ECTI.\\nIf you are a withholding agent making a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment and you make the payment to an intermediary, you must obtain documentation from such intermediary (including the intermediary’s chapter 4 status if the payment is a withholdable payment), as well as any required documentation for the beneficial owner(s) of the payment to the extent required under the chapter 3 or 4 regulations.\\nDo not send Forms W-8 to the IRS. Instead, keep the forms in your records for as long as they may be relevant to the determination of your liability under section 1461 (for amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding), section 1474 (for withholdable payments), or Regulations section 1.1471-4(c)(2)(iv) (for an FFI documenting account holders).\\n\\nForm W-8 provided or signed electronically.\\nYou may rely on a valid Form W-8 received by facsimile or scanned and furnished to you by email unless you know that the person transmitting the Form W-8 is not authorized to do so.\\nYou may also rely on an otherwise valid Form W-8 received electronically from a third-party repository if the form was uploaded or provided to the third-party repository and there are processes in place to ensure that the withholding certificate can be reliably associated with a specific request from you and a specific authorization from the person providing the form (or an agent of the person providing the form) for you to receive the withholding certificate. You may also rely on a withholding statement received from a third-party repository if the intermediary provides a Form W-8IMY and withholding statement through the repository, provides an updated withholding statement to you in the event of any change in the information previously provided, and ensures there are processes in place to update you when there is a new withholding statement (and Forms W-8, as necessary) in the event of any change that would affect the validity of the prior forms or withholding statement. For purposes of this paragraph, a third party repository is an entity that maintains withholding certificates but is not an agent of the applicable withholding agent or the person providing the certificate. See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv)(E) for the complete requirements for relying on a withholding certificate from a third-party repository.\\nIf you are a withholding agent that maintains a system for furnishing Forms W-8 electronically, you must satisfy the requirements of Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv)(B). You may otherwise accept a Form W-8 with an electronic signature if the Form W-8 reasonably demonstrates that the form has been electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and statement that the form has been electronically signed). You may not treat a Form W-8 with a typed name in the signature line as validly signed without further information supporting that the signature is an electronic signature.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nRequesting Prior Versions of Form W-8\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the IRS issues an updated version of a Form W-8, you may accept the prior version of the form until the later of six full months after the revision date shown on the form or the end of the calendar year the updated form is issued (based on the revision date shown on the form), unless the IRS has issued guidance that affects the period for acceptance of the prior version (for example, if a new payee status is required under revised regulations that is not in the prior version and is relevant to the payee’s claim). You were allowed to accept a Form W-8BEN with a revision date of February 2014 until December 31, 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDue Diligence Requirements in General\\nWhen you receive a completed Form W-8, you must review it for completeness and accuracy with respect to the claims made on the form, as well as any information attached to the form, such as withholding statements and beneficial owner withholding certificates associated with a Form W-8IMY. In general, you may rely on the information and certifications provided on the form unless you have actual knowledge or reason to know that the information is unreliable or incorrect. If you know or have reason to know that any information is unreliable or incorrect, you must obtain a new Form W-8 or other appropriate documentation. You may accept a valid Form W-8 for chapter 3 or 61 purposes (or for backup withholding purposes) that does not contain a valid chapter 4 status with respect to payments that are not withholdable payments.\\n\\nReason to know.\\nIn general, you have reason to know that a Form W-8 is unreliable or incorrect if: \\n\\n\\n\\nThe form is incomplete with respect to any item that is relevant to the claims made;\\n\\n\\nThe form contains any information that is inconsistent with the claims made; \\n\\n\\nThe form lacks information necessary to establish that the beneficial owner is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding; or \\n\\n\\nYou have other account information that is inconsistent with the claims made, or you have knowledge of relevant facts or statements contained in the withholding certificate or other documentation that would cause a reasonably prudent person in your position to question the claims made. For example, if you have information in your records that contradicts information provided on the form, you may not rely on the form.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith respect to a claim for benefits under an income tax treaty, your reason to know requirement that the treaty claim is unreliable or incorrect includes when the beneficial owner claims benefits under a treaty that does not exist or is not in force. For this purpose, you may use the list maintained at IRS.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z to check whether a treaty exists and is in force. \\nIf you are a financial institution (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)), insurance company, or broker or dealer in securities maintaining an account for a direct account holder that is the beneficial owner of the payment, and you make a payment of U.S. source FDAP income to the direct account holder, you have reason to know that a Form W-8 that is a beneficial owner withholding certificate (excluding Form W-8ECI) is unreliable or incorrect for establishing foreign status (or residency in a treaty country in item 4, directly below) only if one or more of the following circumstances exist. See also Regulations section 1.441-7(b)(3)(ii) for special rules that apply to preexisting obligations (as defined for such purpose).\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have classified the account holder claiming foreign status as a U.S. person in your account information, the Form W-8 has a current permanent residence address or a current mailing address in the United States, you have a current residence or current mailing address in the United States as part of the account information, the direct account holder notifies you of a new residence or mailing address in the United States, or, only to the extent described in Regulations section 1.1441-7(b)(5), you have a U.S. telephone number as the sole telephone number for the account holder. However: \\n\\n\\n\\nAn individual who has provided a Form W-8BEN may be treated as a foreign person if:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence establishing foreign status (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) that does not contain a U.S. address, and the individual provides you with a reasonable explanation, in writing, supporting his or her claim of foreign status;\\n\\n\\nFor a payment made outside the U.S. with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)), you have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence establishing foreign status (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) that does not contain a U.S. address;\\n\\n\\nFor a payment made with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)), you classify the individual as a resident of the country where the obligation is maintained, you are required to report payments made to the individual annually on a tax information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the country in which the obligation is maintained, and that country has an income tax treaty or information exchange agreement in effect with the United States; or\\n\\n\\nFor a case in which you have classified the account holder as a U.S. person in your account information, you have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B)) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may treat an entity that has provided you with a Form W-8BEN-E as a foreign person if you do not know or have reason to know that the entity is a flow-through entity and:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have in your possession or obtain documentation establishing foreign status that substantiates that the entity is actually organized or created under the laws of a foreign country; or\\n\\n\\nFor a payment made with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)), you classify the entity as a resident of the country in which the account is maintained, you are required to report a payment made to the entity annually on a tax information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the country in which the obligation is maintained, and that country has an income tax treaty or tax information exchange agreement in effect with the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe form is provided with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)) and the direct account holder has provided standing instructions directing you to pay amounts from its account to an address in, or an account maintained in, the United States, unless the account holder provides either a reasonable explanation in writing that supports its foreign status or documentary evidence establishing its foreign status (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)).\\n\\n\\nThe Form W-8BEN is provided by an individual that is a direct account holder and is used to establish foreign status and you have, either on accompanying documentation or as part of your account information, an unambiguous indication of a place of birth for the individual in the United States, unless you have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence (described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B)) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States and either: \\n\\n\\n\\nA copy of the individual’s Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States, or\\n\\n\\nA reasonable written explanation of the account holder’s renunciation of U.S. citizenship or the reason the account holder did not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Form W-8 is provided by a direct account holder and is used to establish residence in a treaty country and:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe permanent residence address on the form is not in the treaty country or the direct account holder notifies you of a new permanent residence address that is not in the treaty country, unless the direct account holder provides a reasonable explanation for the permanent residence address outside the treaty country or you have in your possession, or obtain, documentary evidence (described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) that establishes residency in the treaty country. \\n\\n\\nThe permanent residence address is in the treaty country, but the mailing address on the form is not in the treaty country or you have a current mailing address that is not in the treaty country as part of your account information for the direct account holder, unless:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have in your possession, or obtain, documentary evidence (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) supporting the claim of residence in the treaty country and the additional documentation does not contain an address outside the treaty country;\\n\\n\\nYou have in your possession, or obtain, documentation that establishes that the direct account holder is an entity organized in a treaty country (or an entity managed and controlled in a treaty country, if required by the applicable treaty);\\n\\n\\nYou know that the address outside the treaty country (other than a P.O. box or in-care-of address) is a branch of the direct account holder that is a resident of the treaty country; or\\n\\n\\nThe direct account holder provides a written statement that reasonably establishes entitlement to treaty benefits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe direct account holder has standing instructions for you to pay amounts from the account to an address or account outside the treaty country unless the account holder provides a reasonable explanation, in writing, establishing the account holder\\'s residence in the applicable treaty country or you have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence (described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) establishing the account holder’s residence in the applicable treaty country.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhere required, a reasonable explanation supporting an individual’s claim of foreign status means a written statement prepared by the individual, or, in the alternative, a checklist provided by you and completed by the individual stating that the individual meets one of the requirements listed in Regulations section 1.1441-7(b)(12)(i) through (iv). \\n\\n\\nHold mail instruction.\\nAn address that is provided subject to an instruction to hold all mail to that address is not a permanent residence address, such that you may not rely upon the Form W-8. However, the address can be used as a permanent residence address if the person has provided you with the documentary evidence that is permitted under Regulations section 1.1441-1(c)(38)(ii). If, after a Form W-8 is provided, a person’s permanent residence address is subsequently subject to a hold mail instruction, this is a change in circumstances requiring the person to provide the documentary evidence described in the preceding sentence in order to use the address as a permanent residence address. \\nFor additional information on the standards of knowledge for chapter 3 purposes for relying on a claim of foreign status or a claim of residency in a treaty country, see Regulations section 1.1441-7(b). For additional information on the standards of knowledge for Forms W-8 provided for chapter 4 purposes, see Regulations section 1.1471-3(e).\\n\\n\\nDual claims under a tax treaty.\\nIf you are making payments to a foreign entity that is simultaneously claiming a reduced rate of tax under a tax treaty on its own behalf and a separate treaty claim on behalf of its interest holders for different payments or for different portions of the same payment, you may accept the dual claims even though you hold different withholding certificates that require you to treat the entity inconsistently. Alternatively, you may choose to apply only the claim made by the entity, provided that the entity may be treated as the beneficial owner of the income. If, however, inconsistent claims are made for the same portion of a payment, you may either reject both claims and request consistent claims for that portion of the payment, or you may choose which reduction in rate to apply. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRequirements for Obtaining and Verifying a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN)\\nIf you receive a Form W-8BEN-E, W-8IMY, or W-8EXP from an entity payee claiming certain chapter 4 statuses, you must obtain and verify the entity’s GIIN against the published IRS FFI list. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(e)(3). You must obtain and verify the GIIN for the following chapter 4 statuses.\\n\\n\\n\\nParticipating FFIs (including reporting Model 2 FFIs),\\n\\n\\nRegistered deemed-compliant FFIs (including reporting Model 1 FFIs),\\n\\n\\nDirect reporting NFFEs,\\n\\n\\nSponsored direct reporting NFFEs, and\\n\\n\\nCertain nonreporting IGA FFIs (as described below).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you receive a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY from a nonreporting IGA FFI that is a trustee-documented trust that indicates its trustee is foreign, you must obtain a GIIN of the trustee on the form.\\nIf you receive a Form W-8 from a nonreporting IGA FFI that checks Model 2 IGA in Part XII of Form W-8BEN-E, Part XIX of Form W-8IMY, or Part III, line 15 of Form W-8EXP (as applicable), and identifies a category of entity that is a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Annex II of an applicable Model 2 IGA, you must obtain and verify the GIIN of the nonreporting IGA FFI against the published IRS FFI list. Additionally, if you receive a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY from a nonreporting IGA FFI that provides a citation to a section of the Regulations for its registered deemed-compliant status in Part XII of Form W-8BEN-E or Part XIX of Form W-8IMY (as applicable) or the FFI identifies itself as a registered deemed-complaint FFI in Part I, line 4, of Form W-8EXP, you must obtain and verify the GIIN of the nonreporting IGA FFI against the published IRS FFI list. See Regulations sections 1.1471-1(b)(83) for the definition of nonreporting IGA FFI and 1.1471-3(d)(7)(i) for the documentation requirements for nonreporting IGA FFIs.\\nFor an entity claiming status as a certified deemed-compliant FFI that is a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(2)(iii) on a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY, you must obtain the GIIN for the sponsoring entity and verify it against the published IRS FFI list. For an entity claiming status as a sponsored investment entity or controlled foreign corporation described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(F), you must obtain and verify the GIIN of the sponsored investment entity or controlled foreign corporation against the published IRS FFI list, not the GIIN of the sponsoring entity.\\nIf you receive a Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8IMY, or Form W-8EXP from an entity payee that is claiming chapter 4 status as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI and a sponsored FFI described in the Treasury regulations under section 1471), direct reporting NFFE, sponsored direct reporting NFFE, or nonreporting IGA FFI required to provide a GIIN (as described earlier) that contains \"Applied for\" in the box for the GIIN, the payee must provide its GIIN within 90 days of providing the form. A Form W-8 from such a payee that does not include a GIIN, or includes a GIIN that does not appear on the published IRS FFI list, will be invalid for purposes of chapter 4 beginning on the date that is 90 days after the date the form is provided. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(e)(3)(iii) and (iv).\\nYou may only accept a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY with Part II completed if the entity shown in Part II is an FFI that is a branch of the entity identified in Part II, line 1, and the branch is receiving a withholdable payment, or if the entity shown in Part II is a disregarded entity that is identified in Part I, line 3, as receiving the payment. If you receive a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY from a branch (other than a U.S. branch) or disregarded entity described in the preceding sentence that is receiving a payment associated with the form, you must verify the GIIN of the branch (unless the branch is treated as a nonparticipating FFI) or disregarded entity that is provided in Part II against the published IRS FFI list and not that of the entity identified in Part I, line 1. In such a case, you may accept the form without a GIIN on line 9a (for Form W-8BEN-E) or line 9 (for Form W-8IMY). If you receive a Form W-8BEN-E from a U.S. branch, the branch may provide the GIIN of any other branch of the FFI (including the GIIN for the FFI’s residence country). A U.S. branch providing a Form W-8IMY is not required to provide a GIIN.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPresumption Rules\\nIf you do not receive a valid Form W-8 or Form W-9 that you may rely upon under the due diligence requirements, or cannot otherwise determine whether a payment should be treated as made to a U.S. or foreign person, you must apply the presumption rules provided in the Regulations under sections 1441, 1446, 1471, 6045, and 6049. If the presumption rules are applied to treat a person as a foreign person, the 30% withholding rate applies and cannot be reduced (for example, no treaty rate). You may not rely on the presumption rules if you have actual knowledge that a higher withholding rate is applicable. If you determine that you are making a withholdable payment to an entity and cannot reliably associate the payment with a Form W-8 or other permitted documentation that is valid for chapter 4 purposes, you are required to treat the entity payee as a nonparticipating FFI.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen To Request a New Form W-8\\nRequest a new Form W-8:\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the expiration of the validity period of an existing Form W-8 (when applicable);\\n\\n\\nIf the existing form does not support a claim of reduced rate or is incomplete with respect to any claim made on the form (such as may result, for example, from a new regulatory requirement relevant to the Form W-8); or\\n\\n\\nIf you know or have reason to know of a change in circumstances that makes any information on the current form unreliable or incorrect for purposes of chapter 3 or 4 (to the extent applicable) based on the claims made on the form.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExample.\\nA foreign individual investor opens an account with a broker to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds and provides Form W-8BEN to obtain the portfolio interest exemption. The investor does not complete Part II of Form W-8BEN because he or she is not claiming treaty benefits. Later, the investor purchases U.S. stock and claims treaty benefits on dividend income. The withholding agent must obtain a new Form W-8BEN at that time that provides the information required in Part II to be able to withhold based on the treaty claim and not at the 30% withholding tax rate.\\n\\n\\nChanges in circumstances for chapter 4 purposes.\\nFor chapter 4 purposes, a change in circumstances generally occurs when there is a change in a person’s chapter 4 status. You must treat a Form W-8 as invalid when you know or have reason to know of a change in circumstances that affects the correctness of the form. However, you may continue to treat an FFI as having the same chapter 4 status that it had prior to the change in circumstances until the earlier of 90 days from the date of the change or the date that new documentation is obtained.\\nYou are not considered to have reason to know of a change in circumstances if an FFI’s chapter 4 status changes solely because the jurisdiction where the FFI is resident, organized, or located is treated as having an IGA in effect or if the jurisdiction had a Model 2 IGA in effect and is later treated as having a Model 1 IGA in effect. If such change in circumstances occurs, the FFI may provide you with oral or written confirmation (including by email) of its new chapter 4 status rather than providing a new Form W-8, and you must retain a record of this confirmation. \\nIf an FFI is resident, organized, or located in a jurisdiction that is treated as having an IGA in effect, and the jurisdiction’s status on the Treasury Department’s IGA list (located at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/pages/FATCA.aspx) is later updated to indicate that it is no longer treated as having an IGA in effect, you will have reason to know of a change in circumstances with respect to the FFI’s chapter 4 status on the date that the jurisdiction ceases to be treated as having an IGA in effect. See Announcement 2016–27, 2016-33 I.R.B. 238. If such change in circumstances occurs, the FFI may provide you with oral or written confirmation (including by email) of its new chapter 4 status rather than providing a new Form W-8, and you must retain a record of this confirmation. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nPeriod of Validity\\n\\n\\n\\nGenerally, a Form W-8 is valid from the date signed until the last day of the third succeeding calendar year unless a change in circumstances occurs that makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8BEN signed on September 30, 2018, generally remains valid through December 31, 2021. However, under certain conditions a Form W-8 will be valid indefinitely unless there has been a change in circumstances. For example, a Form W-8BEN and documentary evidence supporting an individual’s claim of foreign status (other than the portion of the form making a claim for treaty benefits) are indefinitely valid if the form and documentary evidence are provided within 30 days of each other. A Form W-8BEN-E and documentary evidence supporting an entity’s claim of foreign status (other than the portion of the form making a claim for treaty benefits) that are received by a withholding agent before the validity period of either the form or the documentary evidence would otherwise expire are indefinitely valid. A Form W-8IMY is valid indefinitely as described in this paragraph, but see Notes for Validating Form W-8IMY, later, for the validity period for a Form W-8IMY provided by a QDD. For further information on the period of validity for a Form W-8 for chapter 3 purposes, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), and for chapter 4 purposes, see Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nForms Received That Are Not Dated or That Contain Inconsequential Errors or Omissions\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a Form W-8 is valid except that the person providing the form has not dated the form, you may date the form from the day you receive it and measure the validity period from that date. Generally, you may treat a withholding certificate as valid if it contains an error or omission that is inconsequential and you have sufficient documentation on file to supplement the missing information. However, a failure to establish an entity type or make a required certification is not inconsequential. For example, if an entity receiving a withholdable payment selects a certified deemed-compliant FFI status on line 5 of Form W-8BEN-E but does not complete the corresponding required certifications in Part V, the form is invalid for chapter 4 purposes. On the other hand, if you receive a Form W-8 for which the person signing the form does not also print a name before the signature when required on the form, you are not required to treat the form as incomplete if you have documentation or information supporting the identity of the person signing the form. An abbreviation of a country of residence on Form W-8BEN is an inconsequential error if it is an ambiguous abbreviation. For further information about withholding certificates that contain inconsequential errors, see Regulations sections 1.1441-1(b)(7)(iv) for chapter 3 purposes and 1.1471-3(c)(7)(i) for chapter 4 purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForeign TINs\\nIf you are a U.S. office or branch of a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or specified insurance company (each as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)) documenting an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) of an account that is a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) you must obtain the account holder’s TIN for its jurisdiction of tax residence (foreign TIN) on a Form W-8 that is a beneficial owner withholding certificate in order for the form to be valid for a payment of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement), unless:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe account holder is resident of a jurisdiction that is not listed in section 3 of Revenue Procedure 2017-46, 2017-43 I.R.B. 372, which may be further updated in future published guidance;\\n\\n\\nThe account holder is resident in a jurisdiction that has been identified by the IRS on a list of jurisdictions for which witholding agents are not required to obtain foreign TINs;\\n\\n\\nThe account holder is a government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, or resident of a U.S. territory; or\\n\\n\\nYou obtain a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA reasonable explanation that an account holder does not have a foreign TIN must address why the account holder was not issued a foreign TIN only to the extent provided in the instructions for the applicable Form W-8. If an account holder provides an explanation other than the one described in the instructions for the applicable Form W-8, you must determine whether the explanation is reasonable. You may accept an explanation that is written in the line on the form for a foreign TIN, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If the account holder writes the explanation on the line for foreign TINs or in the margins of the form, the account holder may shorten it to \"not legally required\".\\nSee Notice 2017-46 for transitional rules for withholding agents to obtain foreign TINs for accounts documented with otherwise valid Forms W-8 that were signed before January 1, 2018. See also Notice 2017-46 for the standards of knowledge (including when there is a change in circumstances) with respect to the foreign TIN requirement. See Notice 2018-20 for additional information on the IRS list of jurisdictions for which withholding agents are not required to obtain foreign TINs.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAlternative Certifications Under an Applicable IGA\\nIf you are an FFI subject to a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA using Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY to document account holders pursuant to the due diligence requirements of Annex I of an applicable IGA, you may request alternative certifications from your account holders in accordance with the requirements of, and definitions applicable to, the IGA instead of the certifications on Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY. You should provide those certifications to account holders from whom you request a Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY, and the account holder should attach the completed certification to the Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY in lieu of completing a certification otherwise required. In such a case, you must provide a written statement to the account holder stating that you have provided the alternative certification to meet your due diligence requirements under an applicable IGA and you must associate the certification with the Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY.\\nIf you are a withholding agent (including an FFI), you may also request and rely upon an alternative certification from an entity account holder to establish that the account holder is a NFFE (rather than a financial institution) under an applicable IGA. An entity providing such a certification will still be required, however, to provide its chapter 4 status (that is, the type of NFFE) in Part I, line 5, as determined under the regulations if you are a withholding agent other than an FFI documenting an account holder under Annex 1 of an applicable IGA. For example, if you are a U.S. withholding agent that receives a Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY from an entity account holder certifying to its status as a passive NFFE, you may request a written certification that the entity is not a financial institution as defined under the IGA applicable to the entity and document it under the regulations by obtaining the NFFE\\'s certification of its chapter 4 status in Part I, line 5. In the case of an FFI documenting an account holder under Annex 1 of an applicable IGA however, a nonprofit organization treated as an active NFFE under the Annex may provide an FFI with an alternative certification that it is an NFFE that qualifies as a nonprofit organization under an applicable IGA. In such a case, the nonprofit organization will not be required to check a box in Part I, line 5, and the FFI may treat the entity as an excepted NFFE.\\nIf you receive an alternative certification under an applicable IGA described in the preceding paragraphs, you may rely on such certification unless you know or have reason to know the certification is incorrect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRules for Specific Types of Forms W–8\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm W–8BEN\\nYou should request Form W-8BEN from any foreign individual for the purposes described previously in these instructions (that is, if you are making a payment subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment; if you are a partnership documenting a partner for purposes of section 1446; if a payee claims foreign status for purposes of domestic information reporting and backup withholding; or if you are an FFI using this form to document an account for purposes of chapter 4).\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes for Validating Form W-8BEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nLine 6 (Foreign TIN).\\nIf you do not obtain a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN) on line 6 (or on a separate statement) when required (see Foreign TINs, earlier), you must treat the form as invalid for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement). \\n\\n\\nLine 8 (Date of birth).\\nIf you are a U.S. office or branch of a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or specified insurance company (each as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)) documenting an individual account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) of an account that is a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)), you must obtain the individual account holder’s date of birth on the Form W-8BEN in order for the form to not be invalid for a payment of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement). If the individual’s date of birth is not provided on the Form W-8BEN, the form is not invalid if you otherwise have the date of birth in your account files for the account holder or you obtain the date of birth on a written statement (including a written statement transmitted by email) from the account holder and associate the written statement with the Form W-8BEN. See Notice 2017-46 for transitional rules for withholding agents to obtain dates of birth for accounts documented with otherwise valid Forms W-8 that were signed before January 1, 2018. \\n\\n\\nLine 10 (Special rates and conditions).\\nIf the beneficial owner is required to explain the additional conditions in the treaty that it meets to be eligible for the rate of withholding on line 10, you may accept a brief explanation for this purpose. You may accept a treaty claim without this explanation under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty or other income article, unless such article requires additional representations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm W–8BEN–E\\nYou should request Form W-8BEN-E from any foreign entity for the purposes described previously in these instructions for Form W-8BEN or if the payee is to establish that certain income from notional principal contracts is not effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (for reporting on Form 1042-S). See Regulations section 1.1441-4.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes for Validating Form W-8BEN-E\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPart I, Line 4 (Chapter 3 status).\\nIf you receive a Form W-8BEN-E from an entity that indicates in Part I, line 4, that it is a disregarded entity, partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust, and the entity has checked \"No\" in Part I, line 4 (regarding the entity’s claim of treaty benefits), you should not accept the Form W-8BEN-E if the form is used with respect to reportable amounts or withholdable payments. In such a case, you should request the entity complete a Form W-8IMY if the entity is a partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust, or have the owner of a disregarded entity complete the appropriate Form W-8. If you are an FFI documenting an entity account holder solely for chapter 4 purposes (that is, you are not required to document the payee for purposes of withholding or domestic information reporting), the entity does not need to provide a chapter 3 status on line 4 of the form.\\n\\n\\nPart I, Line 9b (Foreign TIN).\\nIf you do not obtain a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN) on line 9b (or on a separate statement) when required (see Foreign TINs, earlier), you must treat the form as invalid for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement). \\n\\n\\nPart II (Disregarded Entity or Branch Receiving Payment).\\nIf you are making payments to multiple branches/disregarded entities that would be completing Part II, and the Part I information for each branch/disregarded entity is the same, instead of obtaining separate Forms W-8BEN-E with respect to each branch/disregarded entity, you may accept a single Form W-8BEN-E with a separate schedule attached that includes all of the information required by Part II for each branch/disregarded entity and you are able to allocate each payment to each branch/disregarded entity associated with the form. See Requirements for Obtaining and Verifying a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN), earlier, for when a GIIN is required when Part II is completed.\\n\\n\\nPart III (Claim of Tax Treaty Benefits), Line 14(b).\\nFor a Form W-8BEN-E obtained on or after January 1, 2017, an entity claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty that contains a limitation on benefits article must identify the limitation on benefits provision that it satisfies by checking one of the boxes in line 14(b). In general, the entity is only required to check one box, even if it satisfies more than one provision. If the applicable treaty has no limitation on benefits article, the entity must check the box for \"Other\" and enter “N/A” in the line provided. You may rely on the entity’s claim in line 14(b) unless you have actual knowledge that the claim is incorrect. \\n\\n\\nPart III, Line 15 (Special rates and conditions).\\nIf the beneficial owner is required to explain the additional conditions in the treaty that it meets to be eligible for the rate of withholding on line 15, you may accept a brief explanation. You may accept a treaty claim without this explanation under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty or other income article, unless such article requires additional representations. \\n\\n\\nPart IX, Line 24 (Owner-documented FFI).\\nYou may accept this certificate and treat an entity as an owner-documented FFI only if you are a designated withholding agent under the chapter 4 regulations. Also, an owner-documented FFI that is a nonreporting IGA FFI must check \"owner-documented FFI\" (and not \"nonreporting IGA FFI\") in line 5 and complete Part X. You may accept a Form W-8BEN-E from an entity claiming status as an owner-documented FFI that does not check box 24d in Part X regardless of whether you know that the entity is a trust that has one or more contingent beneficiaries. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm W–8ECI\\nYou should request Form W-8ECI from any foreign person or organization to which you are making a payment if it is the beneficial owner of the income (or an entity engaged in a U.S. trade or business submitting the form on behalf of its owners, partners, or beneficiaries) and claims that the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. However, if you are a partnership, you should request a Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) from a foreign partner that is allocated income that is effectively connected with the conduct of the partnership\\'s trade or business in the United States. Nevertheless, a foreign partner that has made an election under section 871(d) or section 882(d) must provide that election to the partnership along with a Form W-8ECI.\\nIf you receive a Form W-8ECI without a U.S. TIN entered on line 7, you may not treat the income as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and you must apply the appropriate presumption rules. If you receive a Form W-8ECI without a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN) on line 8 (or on a separate statement) when required (see Foreign TINs, earlier), you must treat the form as invalid for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement).\\nYour receipt of Form W-8ECI serves as a representation by the payee or beneficial owner that the items of income identified on line 11 are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Therefore, if a beneficial owner provides you with a Form W-8ECI, you may treat all of the U.S. source income identified on line 11 paid to that beneficial owner as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and not as a withholdable payment for purposes of chapter 4. Accordingly, a chapter 4 status is not required for a payee who provides a valid Form W-8ECI unless you are an FFI requesting a Form W-8ECI from an account holder for purposes of your chapter 4 due diligence requirements.\\nIf you pay items of income that are not identified on line 11 by the beneficial owner as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, generally you are required to obtain another type of Form W-8 from the beneficial owner.\\nGenerally, you may not treat an amount as income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States unless the beneficial owner gives you a valid Form W-8ECI. However, there are exceptions (described below) for income paid on notional principal contracts and payments made to certain U.S. branches.\\n\\nNotional principal contracts reportable on Form 1042-S.\\nWithholding at a 30% rate is not required on amounts paid under the terms of a notional principal contract whether or not a Form W-8ECI is provided (except when a payment made under such contract is U.S. source income, such as a dividend equivalent amount under section 871(m)). However, if the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, it is reportable by you on Form 1042-S (regardless of whether the payment is U.S. source income). You must treat income as effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, even if a Form W-8ECI has not been received, if the income is paid to a qualified business unit of a foreign person located in the United States or if the income is paid to a qualified business unit of a foreign person located outside the United States and you know, or have reason to know, that the payment is income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. However, a payment is not treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business if the payee provides a Form W-8BEN-E representing that the payment is not income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or makes a representation in a master agreement that governs the transactions in notional principal contracts between the parties (for example, an International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement), or in the confirmation on the particular notional principal contract transaction, that the payee is a U.S. person or a non-U.S. branch of a foreign person. \\n\\n\\nPayments to certain U.S. branches treated as effectively connected income.\\nIf you make a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or insurance company that does not provide a withholding certificate but has provided an EIN, the payment is presumed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States even if the foreign person (or its U.S. branch) does not give you a Form W-8ECI. If you do not obtain a Form W-8ECI or the U.S. branch’s EIN, the income paid cannot be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm W–8EXP\\nYou should request Form W-8EXP from any foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession to which you are making a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding if such person is claiming an exemption from withholding under sections 1441, 1442, and 1443 pursuant to section 115(2), 501(c), 892, or 895, or claiming a rate of withholding under section 1443(b). Except as provided below, you should request Form W-8EXP from a person claiming an exemption from withholding under chapter 4 as an exempt beneficial owner or tax-exempt organization under section 501(c) or that is claiming any other chapter 4 status shown on the form when also claiming a chapter 3 status described in the preceding sentence. In certain cases, a GIIN may be required based on the chapter 4 status claimed on the form. See the Requirements for Obtaining and Verifying a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIINs), earlier.\\nIf you are an FFI documenting an account holder that is a tax-exempt organization or exempt beneficial owner (each as defined for chapter 4 purposes) to which you do not pay amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3, you may require that the account holder complete Form W-8BEN-E (rather than Form W-8EXP) to establish its status for chapter 4 purposes.\\nA Form W-8EXP submitted by a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership for purposes of withholding under sections 1441 through 1443 will also establish that partner\\'s foreign status for purposes of section 1446. However, except as provided in Regulations section 1.1446-3(c)(3) (regarding certain tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)), the submission of Form W-8EXP will have no effect on whether the partner is subject to withholding under section 1446.\\nYou may treat a payee as an international organization without requiring a Form W-8EXP if the payee is designated as an international organization by an executive order (pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 288 through 288(f)) and other facts surrounding the payment reasonably indicate that the beneficial owner of the payment is an international organization. With regard to amounts derived from bankers\\' acceptances for chapter 3 purposes, you may treat a payee as a foreign central bank of issue without requiring a Form W-8EXP if the name of the payee and other facts surrounding the payment reasonably indicate that the beneficial owner of the payment is a foreign central bank of issue.\\nA U.S. TIN is required if the beneficial owner is claiming an exemption or reduced rate of withholding based solely on a claim of tax-exempt status under section 501(c) or private foundation status. However, a U.S. TIN is not required from a foreign private foundation that is subject to the 4% excise tax on gross investment income (under section 4948(a)) that would be exempt from withholding except for section 4948(a) (for example, portfolio interest).\\nIf you receive a Form W-8EXP without a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN) on line 8b (or on a separate statement) when required (see Foreign TINs, earlier), you must treat the form as invalid for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm W–8IMY\\nYou should request Form W-8IMY from any entity that is a QI (including a QI acting as a QDD), nonqualified intermediary (including certain U.S. branches and territory financial institutions), a withholding foreign partnership (WP), a withholding foreign trust (WT), or a flow-through entity to which you make a withholdable payment or pay a reportable amount. A flow-through entity includes a foreign partnership (other than a WP), a foreign simple or grantor trust (other than a WT), and, for any payments for which a treaty benefit is claimed, any entity to the extent it is treated as fiscally transparent under the laws of the treaty jurisdiction, as provided in section 894 and the regulations thereunder (without regard to whether it is fiscally transparent under the laws of the United States). Before January 1, 2020, Form W-8IMY may also be provided by an entity to claim chapter 3 status as a qualified securities lender (QSL) with respect to payments of U.S. source substitute dividends and may be relied upon regardless of whether the QSL acts as an intermediary with respect to substitute dividends associated with the form. You may accept a Form W-8IMY from an individual acting as an agent or intermediary (as appropriately amended to account for individual status), but you are not required to obtain such form if you are able to associate payments you make to the person(s) for whom the individual acts.\\nYou may accept multiple Forms W-8IMY from an intermediary that is acting in multiple capacities (for example, as a QI for one account but a nonqualified intermediary or QDD for another account). However, a QI may provide you with a single Form W-8IMY that covers more than one category of QI shown on the form provided that it properly identifies to you the accounts and/or transactions on a withholding statement. You may accept a single Form W-8IMY for multiple branches of the entity providing the form if the information in Part I is the same for each branch and a separate schedule is attached that includes all of the Part II information on each branch and sufficient information to associate the payments with each branch.\\nThe chapter 4 status of an intermediary or flow-through entity is required on Part I of the form if the form is associated with a withholdable payment. Part II must be completed when a withholdable payment is made to a branch or disregarded entity described in Part II of the form.\\nGenerally, for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Regulations under sections 1441 or 1471, a Form W-8IMY must be associated with a withholding statement and withholding certificates (or documentary evidence, where permitted) for the beneficial owners. Generally, the withholding statement must allocate the payment to each payee (or pool of payees, where permitted, as described later), provide the rate of withholding for each payee (or pool of payees), and provide certain identification information on each payee that is not included in a pool. See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(3) for the allowance for a withholding agent to accept an alternative withholding statement from a nonqualified intermediary (which also applies to a flow-through entity).\\nIf you are a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, you may also request Form W-8IMY from an intermediary or flow-through entity that is an account holder to establish its chapter 4 status or status under an applicable IGA even when no payments subject to withholding or domestic information reporting are made to the account. In such a case, a withholding statement is not required.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes for Validating Form W-8IMY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQIs, WPs, and WTs (in general).\\nA QI, WP, or WT acting in its capacity as such must provide the EIN that was issued to the entity in such capacity (that is, its QI-EIN, WP-EIN, or WT-EIN) on Form W-8IMY and not any other EIN it may have in its nonqualified intermediary, nonwithholding foreign partnership, or nonwithholding foreign trust capacity. Because status as a QI, WP, or WT for a financial institution is limited to certain classes of FFIs, if you are making a withholdable payment to a QI, WP, or WT that is a financial institution, you must verify that the QI, WP, or WT certifies its status as one of the permitted classes in Regulations sections 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii) (for a QI), 1.1441-5(c)(2)(ii) (for a WP), or 1.1441-5(e)(5)(v) (for a WT) and provides its GIIN (except in the case of certain foreign central banks of issue and retirement funds). \\nIf a QI checks line 15b of Part III of the form to certify that it assumes primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility, you may accept the form even if you do not know if there are any U.S. accounts receiving reportable payments at the time of the certification. If a QI does not check line 15b or 15c of Part III of the form, you must confirm that the QI is not receiving payments for U.S. accounts that are reportable on Form 1099, and the QI must provide an updated Form W-8IMY or must provide a withholding statement if it allocates payments to such accounts for which it does not assume primary withholding responsibility. A QI may check line 15e of Part III of the form to indicate that it allocates a portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees that includes account holders of another intermediary or flow-through entity even if the withholding statement does not show any intermediaries or flow-through entities at the time the certification is provided. However, a QI is not required to check line 15e of Part III of the form until it provides a withholding statement identifying an intermediary or flow-through entity that receives a payment allocated to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQIs acting as QDDs.\\nYou should only accept a Form W-8IMY from a QI acting as a QDD to the extent you are making payments with respect to potential section 871(m) transactions or underlying securities to the QDD when the entity claims QDD status in Part III of the form. A QDD must indicate its entity classification on line 16b of the form. If you are making such payment that is an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding to a QI that is acting as a QDD and the QDD is claiming treaty benefits applicable to the status identified on line 16b on the payment, you may treat the Form W-8IMY as a beneficial owner withholding certificate and provide such benefits if the QDD provides a statement associated to the Form W-8IMY that includes the necessary information with respect to the treaty claim required in Part III of Form W-8BEN-E. In such case, the portion of the certificate making a claim for treaty benefits is valid until the end of the third calendar year following the year in which the Form W-8IMY is signed (unless a change in circumstances occurs sooner), and the validation rules for a treaty claim apply. A QDD may instead provide a separate Form W-8BEN-E to make the treaty claim. You may otherwise treat a Form W-8IMY provided by a QDD (other than a flow-through entity or disregarded entity) as a beneficial owner withholding certificate for establishing foreign status of the QDD for a payment of U.S. source FDAP income (as long as the QDD provides its foreign TIN (when required) on a QDD withholding statement or a separate statement). A QDD that is receiving payments that it beneficially owns that are not covered by its QI agreement should provide the appropriate Form W-8 based on its status (and not Form W-8IMY). The QDD must provide to you a withholding statement to identify the home office or branch that is treated as the owner for U.S. income tax purposes and, in certain circumstances (described in the instructions for Form W-8IMY), the QDD’s foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why it has not been issued a foreign TIN, if required). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, you are not required to obtain a QDD withholding statement if the branch or home office of the QDD is identified on the form and the form is provided only for payments beneficially owned by the QDD (and a foreign TIN is provided when required). See Foreign TINs, earlier, for when you must treat the form as invalid if a foreign TIN or reasonable explanation is not provided.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQIs assuming withholding on payments of substitute interest.\\nIf a QI represents its status as a QI on a Form W-8IMY with respect to payments of interest and substitute interest and checks line 15g of Part III of the form, you may treat the QI as assuming withholding for payments of interest and substitute interest it receives from you in connection with a sale-repurchase or similar agreement, a securities lending transaction, or collateral that the QI holds in connection with its activities as a dealer in securities.\\n\\n\\nQSLs.\\nIf you make payment of a U.S. source substitute dividend to a QSL (prior to January 1, 2020), the QSL is required to provide its U.S. TIN. If you make a payment to a QSL (prior to January 1, 2020) that is a withholdable payment, you must collect a Form W-8IMY that includes the QSL’s chapter 4 status and GIIN (as applicable) to avoid withholding under chapter 4. A QSL that is a QI should check line 15f of Part III of the form and a QSL that is a nonqualified intermediary should check line 17d of Part IV of the form. You may not associate a Form W-8IMY from a QSL with a payment of a substitute dividend on or after January 1, 2020, and you should obtain a revised withholding certificate.\\nFor information on transition rules for 2018 and 2019 for withholding agents to apply with respect to QSLs, see Notice 2018-05.\\n\\n\\nU.S. branches.\\nIf you make a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or insurance company that represents that it is acting as an intermediary and has agreed to be treated as a U.S. person, you are not required to obtain the GIIN or chapter 4 status of the entity, but you must obtain the U.S. branch’s EIN. If you make a withholdable payment after June 30, 2017, to a U.S. branch of an FFI that is acting as an intermediary and that does not agree to be treated as a U.S. person, the branch must provide its EIN (but does not need to provide a GIIN or chapter 4 status) and certify that the branch is applying the rules described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) by checking the box on line 19c in Part VI of the form. If you do not obtain the certification from a U.S. branch described in the preceding sentence, you must treat the branch as a nonparticipating FFI and withhold under chapter 4 on withholdable payments made to the branch. You are not required to treat as invalid a Form W-8IMY from an account holder that completes Part VI of the form (to the extent required) but does not complete Part II of the form. \\n\\n\\nTerritory financial institutions acting as intermediaries.\\nIf you make a payment to a territory financial institution acting as an intermediary, you must obtain the territory financial institution’s EIN if it agrees to be treated as a U.S. person for chapters 3 and 4. You are not required to obtain a GIIN from a territory financial institution. \\n\\n\\nParticipating FFIs and registered deemed-compliant FFIs that are flow-through entities or acting as intermediaries.\\nIf a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an intermediary or flow-through entity provides you with a withholding statement and documentation for its account holders or payees, you are not required to verify the information on the account holders or payees provided in the documentation for chapter 4 purposes unless the information in the documentation is facially incorrect, and you are not required to obtain additional documentation for an account holder or payee in addition to the withholding certificate unless you are obtaining the documentation for purposes of chapter 3 or 61, or unless you know that the documentation review conducted by the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI was not adequate for purposes of chapter 4. See Regulations section 1.1441-7(b)(10) for the due diligence requirements for indirect account holders for purposes of chapter 3 and see Regulations section 1.1471-3(e)(4)(vi)(B) for standards that apply in such case to determine whether chapter 4 withholding applies. You may rely on documentation that does not include a chapter 4 status for an account holder of an intermediary or flow-through entity that is an FFI when the withholding statement provided by such entity indicates that the payment is made to an account excluded as a financial account under Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2).\\nAn intermediary or flow-through entity that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI may provide a status for chapter 4 purposes found under the requirements of (and documentation or information that is publicly available that determines the chapter 4 status of the payee permitted under) an applicable IGA for an account holder, and you may rely upon such status and documentation, provided that you have the information necessary to report on Form 1042-S. Additionally, see Alternative Certifications Under an Applicable IGA, earlier, for further details on alternative certifications.\\nIn general, if you make a withholdable payment to an intermediary or flow-through entity that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, the FFI may provide an FFI withholding statement that allocates a portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool. If an intermediary provides with its Form W-8IMY an FFI withholding statement that allocates a portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees, the FFI must provide a chapter 4 status on line 5. If the intermediary described in the preceding sentence is a nonqualified intermediary, it must provide the certification required in Part IV with respect to its compliance with the requirements of Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4) (or similar requirements under chapter 61 for a payment other than interest). If the intermediary is a QI, it must certify that it meets the requirements of Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) and, to the extent the U.S. payees are account holders of an intermediary or flow-through entity receiving a payment from the QI, the QI has obtained or will obtain documentation sufficient to establish each such intermediary or flow-through entity status as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or FFI that is a QI. An allocation of a payment shown on a withholding statement and made on or after April 1, 2017, to a nonqualified intermediary, nonwithholding foreign partnership, or nonwithholding foreign trust of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees must identify the payees consistent with the description in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2)(iii) (describing account holders of an FFI that is a non-U.S. payor that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 or 4 or under section 3406, and that are holders of U.S. accounts reported by the FFI under its FATCA requirements as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI).\\n\\n\\nSection 1446 requirements.\\nYou should request Form W-8IMY for purposes of section 1446 only from a foreign upper-tier partnership or foreign grantor trust. Generally, for purposes of section 1446, the Form W-8IMY submitted by these entities is used to transmit the forms of the owners of these entities. The other forms should be accompanied with the information necessary to reliably associate your effectively connected partnership items with the upper-tier partners, in the case of a foreign upper-tier partnership, and the grantor or other owner, in the case of a foreign grantor trust. Then you must look through these entities to the beneficial owners when determining your section 1446 tax obligation. A domestic upper-tier partnership may also provide you this information. Under those circumstances you may, but are not required to, pay the section 1446 withholding tax of the foreign partners of the domestic upper-tier partnership. See Regulations section 1.1446-5. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRequirements for Hybrid and Reverse Hybrid Entities\\nA hybrid entity is an entity that is treated as fiscally transparent under the Code but is not treated as fiscally transparent under the tax laws of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty.\\nIf you are making a payment to a foreign hybrid entity that is making a claim for treaty benefits on its own behalf, the hybrid entity should provide a Form W-8BEN-E to claim treaty benefits. If the hybrid entity is a flow-through entity (not a disregarded entity) claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf on a payment that is a withholdable payment, it should also provide you a Form W-8IMY (including its chapter 4 status) along with a withholding statement (if required) establishing the chapter 4 status of each of its partners or owners to determine whether withholding applies to any portion of the payment. Allocation information is not required on this withholding statement unless one or more partners or owners are subject to chapter 4 withholding. If the hybrid entity is a disregarded entity claiming treaty benefits on a payment that is a withholdable payment, unless the disregarded entity is treated as the payee for chapter 4 purposes and has its own GIIN, the single owner should provide a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8BEN (as applicable) to you along with the Form W-8BEN-E for the hybrid entity. Line 10 of the Form W-8BEN-E may be used by the hybrid entity to associate the Forms W-8.\\nA foreign reverse hybrid entity is an entity that is a corporation for U.S. tax purposes but is fiscally transparent under the tax laws of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. If a foreign reverse hybrid entity is receiving a payment for which the entity is claiming a reduced rate of withholding for its owners, you must obtain from the entity a Form W-8IMY (including its chapter 4 status if the payment is a withholdable payment) along with a withholding statement and documentation for each owner for which the entity claims treaty benefits. If a foreign reverse hybrid entity is receiving a withholdable payment and is not claiming treaty benefits on behalf of any of its owners, you should obtain only a Form W-8BEN-E from the entity to establish its chapter 4 status.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSubstitute Forms W-8 for Payments of Reportable Amounts and Withholdable Payments\\nYou may develop and use your own Form W-8 (a substitute form) for chapters 3 and 4 purposes if its content is substantially similar to the IRS\\'s official Form W-8 (to the extent required by these instructions), it satisfies certain certification requirements, and it includes a signature under a penalties of perjury statement that is identical to the one stated on the official form. You may develop and use a substitute form that is in a foreign language provided that you make an English translation of the form and its contents available to the IRS upon request. You may combine multiple Forms W-8 into a single substitute form.\\nA form that satisfies these substitute forms requirements may be treated as a similar agreed form for purposes of an applicable IGA unless the partner jurisdiction declines such treatment.\\nA substitute form does not need to contain all of the provisions contained on the official form, so long as it contains those provisions that are relevant to the transaction for which it is furnished. You may omit the chapter 4 certifications on your substitute form if such certifications are not required based on the payments made to the payees. If you are an FFI documenting the chapter 4 status of your account holders under your chapter 4 requirements or an applicable IGA, however, you may not omit the chapter 4 certifications. If you are making a withholdable payment, you may choose to provide a substitute form that does not include all of the chapter 4 statuses provided on the Form W-8, but the substitute form must include any chapter 4 status for which withholding may apply.\\nYou may incorporate a substitute Form W-8 into other business forms you customarily use, such as account signature cards, provided the required certifications are clearly set forth. However, you may not:\\n\\n\\n\\nUse a substitute form that requires the payee, by signing, to agree to provisions unrelated to the required certifications; or\\n\\n\\nImply that a person may be subject to 30% withholding or backup withholding unless that person agrees to provisions on the substitute form that are unrelated to the required certifications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA substitute Form W-8 is valid only if it contains the same penalties of perjury statement and certifications as the official forms and the required signature. However, if the substitute form is contained in some other business form, the words “information on this form” may be modified to refer to that portion of the business form containing the substitute form information. The design of the substitute form must be such that the information and certifications that are being attested to by the penalties of perjury statement clearly stand out from any other information contained in the form.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nContent of Substitute Form\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSubstitute Form W-8BEN.\\nThe substitute Form W-8BEN must contain all of the information required in Part I, lines 1 through 8. The certifications in Part II must be included in a substitute form only if treaty benefits are claimed, and then only to the extent that the certifications are required. For example, Form W-8BEN, line 10 (special rates and conditions), is not required if the form is being requested from an individual receiving a payment of U.S. source dividends from stocks that are actively traded on an established securities market. The substitute Form W-8BEN must include a statement that if the person providing the form is a resident in a FATCA partner jurisdiction (that is, a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction with reciprocity), certain tax account information may be provided to the jurisdiction of residence. \\nThe substitute form must contain the penalties of perjury statement identical to the statement on the official Form W-8BEN. Additionally, if the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish your status as a non-U.S. individual and, if applicable, obtain a reduced rate of withholding.\" \\n\\n\\nSubstitute Form W-8BEN-E.\\nThe substitute Form W-8BEN-E must contain all of the information required in Part I, lines 1 through 6, and lines 8 and 9 if a U.S. or foreign TIN or a GIIN is required. See however, Substitute Forms W-8 for Payments of Reportable Amounts and Withholdable Payments, earlier, for when you may omit a chapter 4 certification on a substitute Form W-8. The certifications in Part II must be included in a substitute form if you are making a withholdable payment to a disregarded entity or a branch that must be reported in Part II. The certifications in Part III must be included only if treaty benefits are claimed, and then only to the extent that the certifications are required. See Alternative Certifications Under an Applicable IGA, earlier, in these instructions, for circumstances in which the chapter 4 certifications may be replaced with alternative certifications.\\nIf the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish your status as a non-U.S. person, establish your chapter 4 status (if required), and, if applicable, obtain a reduced rate of withholding.\" \\n\\n\\nSubstitute Form W-8ECI.\\nThe substitute Form W-8ECI must contain all of the information required in Part I other than line 9. The certifications in Part II of Form W-8ECI must be included in a substitute form. \\nIf the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish your status as a non-U.S. person and that the income for which this form is provided is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.\" \\n\\n\\nSubstitute Form W-8EXP.\\nThe substitute Form W-8EXP must contain all of the information required in Part I, lines 1 through 5, line 7 (if a U.S. TIN is required), and line 8. See however, Substitute Forms W-8 for Payments of Reportable Amounts and Withholdable Payments, earlier, for when you may omit a chapter 4 certification on a substitute Form W-8. The substitute Form W-8EXP must also contain all of the statements and certifications contained in Parts II and III, as applicable, with respect to the purpose for which the form is provided, but a specific statement or certification needs to be included (in its entirety) only if it is relevant to the type of entity providing the form. For example, if a withholding agent is documenting a beneficial owner that is a foreign government for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4, the withholding agent may use a substitute Form W-8EXP that contains the required information in Part I, plus the required statements and certifications from Parts II and III that are related to foreign governments, and does not need to include the statements and certifications for other types of entities that would otherwise be providing the Form W-8EXP.\\nIf the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish your status as a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession, and your chapter 4 status (if required).\" \\n\\n\\nSubstitute Form W-8IMY.\\nThe substitute Form W-8IMY must contain all of the information required in Part I, lines 1 through 6, line 8 (if a U.S. TIN is required), and line 9 (if a GIIN is required). See however, Substitute Forms W-8 for Payments of Reportable Amounts and Withholdable Payments, earlier, for when you may omit a chapter 4 certification on a substitute Form W-8. The information required in Part II must be included in a substitute form if you are making a withholdable payment to a disregarded entity that has its own GIIN or a branch (including a branch that is a disregarded entity that does not have its own GIIN) operating in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction of residence of the entity named in Part I of the form. The substitute Form W-8IMY must also contain all of the statements and certifications relevant to chapter 3 contained in Parts III through VIII if you are making a payment subject to withholding under chapter 3 and the statements and certifications relevant to the chapter 4 status contained in Parts IX through XXVIII for the intermediary or flow-through entity providing the form if you are making a withholdable payment or if you are an FFI documenting your account holders for purposes of chapter 4 or an applicable IGA. For example, if the only intermediaries to which a U.S. withholding agent makes payments are qualified intermediaries that are participating FFIs, the withholding agent may use a substitute Form W-8IMY that contains only the required information from Part I (including line 9 to collect the intermediaries’ GIINs), plus the statements and certifications from Part III. A substitute Form W-8IMY must also incorporate the same attachments as the official form (such as a withholding statement and beneficial owner documentation, to the extent otherwise required). You may also include any information in a substitute Form W-8IMY, or require any information to be associated with the form, that is reasonably related to your obligation to withhold and correctly report payments. \\nIf the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish: (1) your status as a qualified intermediary, a nonqualified intermediary, a specific type of U.S. branch, a withholding foreign partnership, a withholding foreign trust, a nonwithholding foreign partnership, a nonwithholding foreign simple trust, or a nonwithholding foreign grantor trust; (2) your chapter 4 status; and/or (3) prior to January 1, 2020, your status as a qualified securities lender.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNon-IRS Form for Individuals Not Receiving Reportable Amounts\\nIf you are an FFI documenting an account holder that is an individual and you are not making a payment of a reportable amount to such account holder, you may use a non-IRS form rather than a substitute Form W-8BEN. The form must include the name and address of the individual that is the payee or beneficial owner, all countries in which the individual is resident for tax purposes, the individual’s country of birth, a taxpayer identification number, if any, for each country of residence, and the individual’s date of birth. The form may also request other information required for purposes of tax or anti-money laundering (AML) due diligence in the United States or in other countries. A form that satisfies these requirements may be treated as a similar agreed form for purposes of an applicable IGA unless the partner jurisdiction declines such treatment.\\nGenerally, a non-IRS form for individuals must contain a signed and dated certification made under penalties of perjury that the information provided on the form is accurate and will be updated by the individual within 30 days of a change in circumstances that causes the form to become incorrect. However, the signed certification provided on a form need not be signed under penalties of perjury if the form is accompanied by documentary evidence that supports the individual’s claim of foreign status. Such documentary evidence may be the same documentary evidence that is used to support foreign status in the case of a payee whose account has U.S. indicia as described in Regulations sections 1.1471-3(e) and 1.1471-4(c)(4)(i)(A).\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nInstructions for Form W-8BEN (07/2017)\\n\\nCertificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner forUnited States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals)\\n\\n\\n\\nSection references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.\\n\\n\\n\\nRevised: 07/2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Instructions\\n\\n\\nFor definitions of terms used throughout these instructions, see Definitions, later.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPurpose of Form\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEstablishing status for chapter 3 purposes.\\nForeign persons are subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest (including certain original issue discount (OID));\\n\\n\\nDividends;\\n\\n\\nRents;\\n\\n\\nRoyalties;\\n\\n\\nPremiums;\\n\\n\\nAnnuities;\\n\\n\\nCompensation for, or in expectation of, services performed;\\n\\n\\nSubstitute payments in a securities lending transaction; or\\n\\n\\nOther fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThis tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person, such as an intermediary, agent, or partnership, for the benefit of the beneficial owner.\\nIn addition, section 1446 requires a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States to withhold tax on a foreign partner\\'s distributive share of the partnership\\'s effectively connected taxable income. Generally, a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership that submits a Form W-8BEN for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will satisfy the documentation requirements under section 1446 as well. However, in some cases the documentation requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 do not match the documentation requirements of section 1446. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6. \\n\\nNote.\\nThe owner of a disregarded entity (including an individual), rather than the disregarded entity itself, must submit the appropriate Form W-8BEN for purposes of section 1446.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you receive certain types of income, you must provide Form W-8BEN to: \\n\\n\\n\\nEstablish that you are not a U.S. person;\\n\\n\\nClaim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8BEN is being provided or a foreign partner in a partnership subject to section 1446; and\\n\\n\\nIf applicable, claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding as a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty and who is eligible for treaty benefits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou may also be required to submit Form W-8BEN to claim an exception from domestic information reporting and backup withholding (at the backup withholding rate under section 3406) for certain types of income that are not subject to foreign-person withholding at a rate of 30% under section 1441. Such income includes: \\n\\n\\n\\nBroker proceeds;\\n\\n\\nShort-term (183 days or less) OID;\\n\\n\\nBank deposit interest;\\n\\n\\nForeign source interest, dividends, rents, or royalties; and\\n\\n\\nProceeds from a wager placed by a nonresident alien individual in the games of blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette, or big-6 wheel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA withholding agent or payer of the income may rely on a properly completed Form W-8BEN to treat a payment associated with the Form W-8BEN as a payment to a foreign person who beneficially owns the amounts paid. If applicable, the withholding agent may rely on the Form W-8BEN to apply a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding at source.\\nProvide Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid or credited to you. Failure to provide a Form W-8BEN when requested may lead to withholding at the foreign-person withholding rate of 30% or the backup withholding rate under section 3406.\\n\\n\\nEstablishing status for chapter 4 purposes.\\nA foreign financial institution (FFI) may rely on a properly completed Form W-8BEN to establish your chapter 4 status as a foreign person. The Form W-8BEN should be provided to the FFI when requested. Failure to do so could result in 30% withholding on income paid or credited to you as a recalcitrant account holder from sources within the United States. See the definition of amounts subject to withholding, later.\\n\\n\\nAdditional information.\\nFor additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must Provide Form W-8BEN\\nYou must give Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent or payer if you are a nonresident alien who is the beneficial owner of an amount subject to withholding, or if you are an account holder of an FFI documenting yourself as a nonresident alien. If you are the single owner of a disregarded entity, you are considered the beneficial owner of income received by the disregarded entity. Submit Form W-8BEN when requested by the withholding agent, payer, or FFI whether or not you are claiming a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding.\\nYou should also provide Form W-8BEN to a payment settlement entity (PSE) requesting this form if you are a foreign individual receiving payments subject to reporting under section 6050W (payment card transactions and third-party network transactions) as a participating payee. However, if the payments are income which is effectively connected to the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, you should instead provide the PSE with a Form W-8ECI.\\nDo not use Form W-8BEN if you are described below.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are a foreign entity documenting your foreign status, documenting your chapter 4 status, or claiming treaty benefits. Instead, use Form W-8BEN-E.\\n\\n\\nYou are a U.S. citizen (even if you reside outside the United States) or other U.S. person (including a resident alien individual). Instead, use Form W-9 to document your status as a U.S. person.\\n\\n\\nYou are acting as a foreign intermediary (that is, acting not for your own account, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian). Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.\\n\\n\\nYou are a nonresident alien individual who claims exemption from withholding on compensation for independent or dependent personal services performed in the United States. Instead, provide Form 8233 or Form W-4.\\n\\n\\nYou are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, unless it is allocable to you through a partnership. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI. If any of the income for which you have provided a Form W-8BEN becomes effectively connected, this is a change in circumstances and Form W-8BEN is no longer valid with respect to such income. You must file Form W-8ECI. See Change in circumstances, later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nGiving Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent.\\nDo not send Form W-8BEN to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. An FFI may also request this form from you to document your account as other than a U.S. account. Give Form W-8BEN to the person requesting it before the payment is made to you, credited to your account, or allocated. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold at the 30% rate (under chapters 3 and 4), backup withholding rate, or the rate applicable under section 1446. If you receive more than one type of income from a single withholding agent for which you claim different benefits, the withholding agent may, at its option, require you to submit a Form W-8BEN for each different type of income. Generally, a separate Form W-8BEN must be given to each withholding agent.\\n\\nNote.\\nIf you own the income or account jointly with one or more other persons, the income or account will be treated by the withholding agent as owned by a foreign person that is a beneficial owner of a payment only if Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E are provided by all of the owners. If the withholding agent or financial institution receives a Form W-9 from any of the joint owners, however, the payment must be treated as made to a U.S. person and the account treated as a U.S. account.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nExpiration of Form W-8BEN.\\nGenerally, a Form W-8BEN will remain in effect for purposes of establishing foreign status for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year, unless a change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8BEN signed on September 30, 2015, remains valid through December 31, 2018. \\nHowever, under certain conditions a Form W-8BEN will remain in effect indefinitely until a change of circumstances occurs. To determine the period of validity for Form W-8BEN for purposes of chapter 4, see Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii). To determine the period of validity for Form W-8BEN for purposes of chapter 3, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii).\\n\\n\\nChange in circumstances.\\nIf a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8BEN you have submitted incorrect, you must notify the withholding agent, payer, or FFI with which you hold an account within 30 days of the change in circumstances and you must file a new Form W-8BEN or other appropriate form.\\nIf you use Form W-8BEN to certify that you are a foreign person, a change of address to an address in the United States is a change in circumstances. Generally, a change of address within the same foreign country or to another foreign country is not a change in circumstances. However, if you use Form W-8BEN to claim treaty benefits, a move to the United States or outside the country where you have been claiming treaty benefits is a change in circumstances. In that case, you must notify the withholding agent, payer, or FFI within 30 days of the move.\\nIf you become a U.S. citizen or resident alien after you submit Form W-8BEN, you are no longer subject to the 30% withholding rate under section 1441 or the withholding tax on a foreign partner\\'s share of effectively connected income under section 1446. To the extent you have an account with an FFI, your account may be subject to reporting by the FFI under chapter 4. You must notify the withholding agent, payer, or FFI within 30 days of becoming a U.S. citizen or resident alien. You may be required to provide a Form W-9. For more information, see Form W-9 and its instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou may be a U.S. resident for tax purposes depending on the number of days you are physically present in the United States over a 3-year period. See Pub. 519, available at IRS.gov/Pub519. If you satisfy the substantial presence test, you must notify the withholding agent, payer, or financial institution with which you have an account within 30 days and provide a Form W-9.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDefinitions\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAccount holder.\\nAn account holder is generally the person listed or identified as the holder or owner of a financial account. For example, if a partnership is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, then the partnership is the account holder, rather than the partners of the partnership (subject to some exceptions). However, an account that is held by a single-member disregarded entity is treated as held by the entity\\'s single owner. \\n\\n\\nAmounts subject to withholding.\\nGenerally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID). \\nFor purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. \\nGenerally, an amount subject to chapter 4 withholding is an amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a). The exemptions from withholding provided for under chapter 3 are not applicable when determining whether withholding applies under chapter 4. For specific exceptions applicable to the definition of a withholdable payment, see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) (exempting, for example, certain nonfinancial payments). \\n\\n\\nBeneficial owner.\\nFor payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income.\\nForeign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself.\\nFor purposes of section 1446, the same beneficial owner rules apply, except that under section 1446 a foreign simple trust rather than the beneficiary provides the form to the partnership.\\nThe beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself.\\nNote. A payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee that is not subject to 30% withholding under chapter 3 or 4. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. For purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust or disregarded entity shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9 in its own right. Rather, the grantor or other owner shall provide the withholding agent the appropriate form.\\n\\n\\nChapter 3.\\nChapter 3 means chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.\\n\\n\\nChapter 4.\\nChapter 4 means chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.\\n\\n\\nDeemed-compliant FFI.\\nUnder section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN). These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f).\\n\\n\\nDisregarded entity.\\nA business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. A disregarded entity does not submit this Form W-8BEN to a partnership for purposes of section 1446 or to an FFI for purposes of chapter 4. Instead, the owner of such entity provides appropriate documentation. See Regulations section 1.1446-1 and section 1.1471-3(a)(3)(v), respectively. \\nCertain entities that are disregarded for U.S. tax purposes may be recognized for purposes of claiming treaty benefits under an applicable tax treaty (see the definition of hybrid entity below). A hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits is required to complete Form W-8BEN-E. See Form W-8BEN-E and its instructions.\\n\\n\\nFinancial account.\\nA financial account includes: \\n\\n\\n\\nA depository account maintained by a financial institution;\\n\\n\\nA custodial account maintained by a financial institution;\\n\\n\\nEquity or debt interests (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market) in investment entities and certain holding companies, treasury centers, or financial institutions as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e);\\n\\n\\nCash value insurance contracts; and\\n\\n\\nAnnuity contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor purposes of chapter 4, exceptions are provided for accounts such as certain tax-favored savings accounts; term life insurance contracts; accounts held by estates; escrow accounts; and annuity contracts. These exceptions are subject to certain conditions. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2). Accounts may also be excluded from the definition of financial account under an applicable IGA. \\n\\n\\nFinancial institution.\\nA financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts.\\n\\n\\nForeign financial institution (FFI).\\nAn FFI generally means a foreign entity that is a financial institution.\\n\\n\\nForeign person.\\nA foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual and certain foreign entities that are not U.S. persons (entities should complete Form W-8BEN-E rather than this Form W-8BEN). \\n\\n\\nHybrid entity.\\nA hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of its status under the Code but is not treated as fiscally transparent by a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. Hybrid status is relevant for claiming treaty benefits.\\n\\n\\nIntergovernmental agreement (IGA).\\nAn IGA means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, see the list of jurisdictions at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx. \\nA Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI.\\nA Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that has entered into an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is a participating FFI, but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI.\\n\\n\\nNonresident alien individual.\\nAny individual who is not a citizen or resident alien of the United States is a nonresident alien individual. An alien individual meeting either the \"green card test\" or the \"substantial presence test\" for the calendar year is a resident alien. Any person not meeting either test is a nonresident alien individual. Additionally, an alien individual who is treated as a nonresident alien pursuant to Regulations section 301.7701(b)-7 for purposes figuring the individual\\'s U.S. tax liability, or an alien individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or American Samoa is a nonresident alien individual. See Pub. 519 for more information on resident and nonresident alien status. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nEven though a nonresident alien individual married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien may choose to be treated as a resident alien for certain purposes (for example, filing a joint income tax return), such individual is still treated as a nonresident alien for chapter 3 withholding tax purposes on all income except wages. For purposes of chapter 4, a nonresident alien individual who holds a joint account with a U.S. person will be considered a holder of a U.S. account for chapter 4 purposes.\\n\\n\\nParticipating FFI.\\nA participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term \"participating FFI\" also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a qualified intermediary (QI) branch of a U.S. financial institution, unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI. \\n\\n\\nParticipating payee.\\nA participating payee means any person that accepts a payment card as payment or accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization in settlement of a third-party network transaction. \\n\\n\\nPayment settlement entity (PSE).\\nA PSE is a merchant acquiring entity or third-party settlement organization. Under section 6050W, a PSE is generally required to report payments made in settlement of payment card transactions or third-party network transactions. However, a PSE is not required to report payments made to a beneficial owner that is documented as foreign with an applicable Form W-8. \\n\\n\\nRecalcitrant account holder.\\nA recalcitrant account holder includes an individual who fails to comply with the requests of an FFI for documentation and information for determining the U.S. or foreign status of the individual’s account, including furnishing this Form W-8BEN when requested.\\n\\n\\nU.S. person.\\nA U.S. person is defined in section 7701(a)(30) and includes an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States. For purposes of chapter 4, a U.S. person is defined in Regulations section 1.1471-1(b)(141).\\n\\n\\nWithholding agent.\\nAny person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or 4 withholding is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies.\\nFor purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent may be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart I\\n\\nLine 1.\\nEnter your name. If you are a foreign individual who is the single owner of a disregarded entity that is not claiming treaty benefits as a hybrid entity, with respect to a payment, you should complete this form with your name and information. If the account to which a payment is made or credited is in the name of the disregarded entity, you should inform the withholding agent of this fact. This may be done by including the name and account number of the disregarded entity on line 7 (reference number) of the form. However, if the disregarded entity is claiming treaty benefits as a hybrid entity, it should complete Form W-8BEN-E instead of this Form W-8BEN.\\n\\n\\nLine 2.\\nEnter your country of citizenship. If you are a dual citizen, enter the country where you are both a citizen and a resident at the time you complete this form. If you are not a resident in any country in which you have citizenship, enter the country where you were most recently a resident. However, if you are a U. S. citizen, you should not complete this form even if you hold citizenship in another jurisdiction. Instead, provide Form W-9. \\n\\n\\nLine 3.\\nYour permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for purposes of that country’s income tax. If you are completing Form W-8BEN to claim a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty, you must determine your residency in the manner required by the treaty. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes. If you do not have a tax residence in any country, your permanent residence is where you normally reside.\\nIf you reside in a country that does not use street addresses, you may enter a descriptive address on line 3. The address must accurately indicate your permanent residence in the manner used in your jurisdiction. \\n\\n\\nLine 4.\\nEnter your mailing address only if it is different from the address you show on line 3. \\n\\n\\nLine 5.\\nIf you have a social security number (SSN), enter it here. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5 from a Social Security Administration (SSA) office or online at www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf. If you are in the United States, you can call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213. Complete Form SS-5 and return it to the SSA. \\nIf you do not have an SSN and are not eligible to get one, you can get an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). To apply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 with the IRS. It usually takes 4–6 weeks to get an ITIN. To claim certain treaty benefits, you must complete line 5 by submitting an SSN or ITIN, or line 6 by providing a foreign tax identification number (foreign TIN).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAn ITIN is for tax use only. It does not entitle you to social security benefits or change your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. \\nA partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States will likely be allocated effectively connected taxable income. The partner is required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and must have a U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN). \\nYou must provide an SSN or TIN if you are:\\n\\n\\n\\nClaiming an exemption from withholding under section 871(f) for certain annuities received under qualified plans, or\\n\\n\\nSubmitting the form to a partnership that conducts a trade or business in the United States. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are claiming treaty benefits, you are generally required to provide an ITIN if you do not provide a tax identifying number issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence on line 6. However, an ITIN is not required to claim treaty benefits relating to: \\n\\n\\n\\nDividends and interest from stocks and debt obligations that are actively traded;\\n\\n\\nDividends from any redeemable security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (mutual fund);\\n\\n\\nDividends, interest, or royalties from units of beneficial interest in a unit investment trust that are (or were upon issuance) publicly offered and are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933; and\\n\\n\\nIncome related to loans of any of the above securities. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLine 6.\\nIf you are providing this Form W-8BEN to document yourself as an account holder with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the TIN issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence identified on line 3 unless:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs), or\\n\\n\\nYou are a resident of a U.S. possession.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 6, and you are not a resident of a U.S. possession, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation for why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. The explanation may be written on line 6, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If you are writing the explanation on line 6, you may shorten it to \"not legally required.\" Do not write \"not applicable.\" \\nIn addition, if you are not using this form to document a financial account described above, you may provide the TIN issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence on line 6 for purposes of claiming treaty benefits (rather than providing a U.S. TIN on line 5, if required). \\n\\n\\nLine 7.\\nThis line may be used by the filer of Form W-8BEN or by the withholding agent to whom it is provided to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its obligations. For example, withholding agents who are required to associate the Form W-8BEN with a particular Form W-8IMY may want to use line 7 for a referencing number or code that will make the association clear. A beneficial owner can use line 7 to include the number of the account for which he or she is providing the form. A foreign single owner of a disregarded entity can use line 7 to inform the withholding agent that the account to which a payment is made or credited is in the name of the disregarded entity (see the instructions for line 1). \\n\\n\\nLine 8.\\nIf you are providing this Form W-8BEN to document yourself as an account holder with respect to a financial account as described above in line 6 that you hold with a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI), provide your date of birth. Use the following format to input your information: MM-DD-YYYY. For example, if you were born on April 15, 1956, you would enter 04-15-1956.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart II\\n\\nLine 9.\\nIf you are claiming treaty benefits as a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty for payments subject to withholding under chapter 3, identify the country where you claim to be a resident for income tax treaty purposes. For treaty purposes, a person is a resident of a treaty country if the person is a resident of that country under the terms of the treaty. A list of U.S. tax treaties is available at IRS.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Tax-Treaties.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are related to the withholding agent within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b) and the aggregate amount subject to withholding received during the calendar year exceeds $500,000, then you are generally required to file Form 8833, Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b), available at IRS.gov/Form8833. See the Instructions for Form 8833 for more information on the filing requirements. \\n\\n\\nLine 10.\\nLine 10 must be used only if you are claiming treaty benefits that require that you meet conditions not covered by the representations you make on line 9 and Part III. For example, persons claiming treaty benefits on royalties must complete this line if the treaty contains different withholding rates for different types of royalties. However, this line should always be completed by foreign students and researchers claiming treaty benefits. See Scholarship and fellowship grants, later, for more information. \\nThis line is generally not applicable to treaty benefits under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty. \\n\\n\\nNonresident alien who becomes a resident alien.\\nGenerally, only a nonresident alien individual can use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a \"saving clause\" which preserves or \"saves\" the right of each country to tax its own residents as if no tax treaty existed. Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the recipient has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes. The individual must use Form W-9 to claim the tax treaty benefit. See the instructions for Form W-9 for more information. Also see Nonresident alien student or researcher who becomes a resident alien, later, for an example.\\n\\n\\nScholarship and fellowship grants.\\nA nonresident alien student (including a trainee or business apprentice) or researcher who receives noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship income can use Form W-8BEN to claim benefits under a tax treaty that apply to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on such income. No Form W-8BEN is required unless a treaty benefit is being claimed. A nonresident alien student or researcher who receives compensatory scholarship or fellowship income must use Form 8233, instead of Form W-8BEN, to claim any benefits of a tax treaty that apply to that income. The student or researcher must use Form W-4 for any part of such income for which he or she is not claiming a tax treaty withholding exemption. Do not use Form W-8BEN for compensatory scholarship or fellowship income. See Compensation for Dependent Personal Services in the Instructions for Form 8233.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are a nonresident alien individual who received noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship income and personal services income (including compensatory scholarship or fellowship income) from the same withholding agent, you may use Form 8233 to claim a tax treaty withholding exemption for part or all of both types of income.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCompleting lines 3 and 9.\\nMost tax treaties that contain an article exempting scholarship or fellowship grant income from taxation require that the recipient be a resident of the other treaty country at the time of, or immediately prior to, entry into the United States. Thus, a student or researcher may claim the exemption even if he or she no longer has a permanent address in the other treaty country after entry into the United States. If this is the case, you can provide a U.S. address on line 3 and still be eligible for the exemption if all other conditions required by the tax treaty are met. You must also identify on line 9 the tax treaty country of which you were a resident at the time of, or immediately prior to, your entry into the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCompleting line 10.\\nYou must complete line 10 if you are a student or researcher claiming an exemption from taxation on your noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship grant income under a tax treaty.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNonresident alien student or researcher who becomes a resident alien.\\nYou must use Form W-9 to claim an exception to a saving clause. See Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien, earlier, for a general explanation of saving clauses and exceptions to them.\\n\\n\\nExample.\\nArticle 20 of the United States-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first protocol to the United States-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would complete Form W-9.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart III\\nForm W-8BEN must be signed and dated by the beneficial owner of the amount subject to withholding or the account holder of an FFI (or an agent with legal authority to act on the person’s behalf). If Form W-8BEN is completed by an agent acting under a duly authorized power of attorney for the beneficial owner or account holder, the form must be accompanied by the power of attorney in proper form or a copy thereof specifically authorizing the agent to represent the principal in making, executing, and presenting the form. Form 2848 can be used for this purpose. The agent, as well as the beneficial owner or account holder, may incur liability for the penalties provided for an erroneous, false, or fraudulent form.\\nA withholding agent may allow you to provide this form with an electronic signature. The electronic signature must indicate that the form was electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and statement that the form has been electronically signed). Simply typing your name into the signature line is not an electronic signature.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf any information on Form W-8BEN becomes incorrect, you must submit a new form within 30 days unless you are no longer an account holder of the requester that is an FFI and you will not receive a future payment with respect to the account.\\n\\nBroker transactions or barter exchanges.\\nIncome from transactions with a broker or a barter exchange is subject to reporting rules and backup withholding unless Form W-8BEN or a substitute form is filed to notify the broker or barter exchange that you are an exempt foreign person. \\nYou are an exempt foreign person for a calendar year in which:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, partnership, estate, or trust;\\n\\n\\nYou are an individual who has not been, and does not plan to be, present in the United States for a total of 183 days or more during the calendar year; and\\n\\n\\nYou are neither engaged, nor plan to be engaged during the year, in a U.S. trade or business that has effectively connected gains from transactions with a broker or barter exchange.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions for\\nForm W-8BEN - Notices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nPaperwork Reduction Act Notice.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe ask for the information on this form to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States. You are required to provide the information. We need it to ensure that you are complying with these laws and to allow us to figure and collect the right amount of tax.\\nYou are not required to provide the information requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB control number. Books or records relating to a form or its instructions must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any Internal Revenue law. Generally, tax returns and return information are confidential, as required by section 6103.\\nThe time needed to complete and file this form will vary depending on individual circumstances. The estimated burden for business taxpayers filing this form is approved under OMB control number 1545-0123. The estimated burden for all other taxpayers who file this form is: Recordkeeping, 2 hr., 52 min.; Learning about the law or the form, 2 hr., 05 min.; Preparing the form, 2 hr., 13 min.\\nIf you have comments concerning the accuracy of these time estimates or suggestions for making this form simpler, we would be happy to hear from you. You can send us comments from IRS.gov/FormComments.\\nYou can write to Internal Revenue Service, Tax Forms and Publications, 1111 Constitution Ave. NW, IR-6526, Washington, DC 20224. Do not send Form W-8BEN to this office. Instead, give it to your withholding agent.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nInstructions for Form W-8BEN-E (07/2017)\\n\\nCertificate of Status of Beneficial Owner forUnited States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities)\\n\\n\\n\\nSection references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.\\n\\n\\n\\nRevised: 07/2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Instructions\\n\\n\\nFor definitions of terms used throughout these instructions, see Definitions, later.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPurpose of Form\\nThis form is used by foreign entities to document their statuses for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4, as well as for certain other Code provisions as described later in these instructions.\\nForeign persons are subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of:\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest (including certain original issue discount (OID));\\n\\n\\nDividends;\\n\\n\\nRents;\\n\\n\\nRoyalties;\\n\\n\\nPremiums;\\n\\n\\nAnnuities;\\n\\n\\nCompensation for, or in expectation of, services performed;\\n\\n\\nSubstitute payments in a securities lending transaction; or\\n\\n\\nOther fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThis tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441 or 1442 on that amount. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person, such as an intermediary, agent, or partnership, for the benefit of the beneficial owner.\\nIn addition, section 1446 requires a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States to withhold tax on a foreign partner’s distributive share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. Generally, a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership that submits a Form W-8 for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will satisfy the documentation requirements under section 1446 as well. However, in some cases the documentation requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 do not match the documentation requirements of section 1446. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.\\nA withholding agent or payer of the income may rely on a properly completed Form W-8BEN-E to treat a payment associated with the Form W-8BEN-E as a payment to a foreign person who beneficially owns the amounts paid. If applicable, the withholding agent may rely on the Form W-8BEN-E to apply a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding. If you receive certain types of income, you must provide Form W-8BEN-E to:\\n\\n\\n\\nClaim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8BEN-E is being provided or a partner in a partnership subject to section 1446; and\\n\\n\\nIf applicable, claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding as a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou may also use Form W-8BEN-E to identify income from a notional principal contract that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States to establish the exception to reporting such income on Form 1042-S. See Regulations section 1.1461-1(c)(2)(ii)(F).\\nForm W-8BEN-E may also be used to claim exemption from withholding for portfolio interest pursuant to section 881(c). The portfolio interest exemption does not apply to payments of interest for which the recipient is a 10 percent shareholder of the payer or to payments of interest received by a controlled foreign corporation from a related person. See sections 881(c)(3) and 881(c)(5). A future version of this form may require that persons receiving interest payments to which this form relates identify any obligation with respect to which they have one of these prohibited relationships.\\nYou may also be required to submit Form W-8BEN-E to claim an exception from domestic information reporting on Form 1099 and backup withholding (at the backup withholding rate under section 3406) for certain types of income. Such income includes:\\n\\n\\n\\nBroker proceeds.\\n\\n\\nShort-term (183 days or less) original issue discount (short-term OID).\\n\\n\\nBank deposit interest.\\n\\n\\nForeign source interest, dividends, rents, or royalties.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nProvide Form W-8BEN-E to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid or credited to you. Failure to provide a Form W-8BEN-E when requested may lead to withholding at a 30% rate or the backup withholding rate in certain cases when you receive a payment to which backup withholding applies.\\nIn addition to the requirements of chapter 3, chapter 4 requires withholding agents to identify the chapter 4 status of entities that are payees receiving withholdable payments. A withholding agent may request this Form W-8BEN-E to establish your chapter 4 status and avoid withholding at a 30% rate on such payments.\\nChapter 4 also requires participating FFIs and certain registered deemed-compliant FFIs to document their entity account holders in order to determine their chapter 4 statuses regardless of whether withholding applies to any payments made to the entities. If you are an entity maintaining an account with an FFI, the FFI may request that you provide this Form W-8BEN-E in order to document your chapter 4 status.\\n\\nAdditional information.\\nFor additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must Provide Form W-8BEN-E\\nYou must give Form W-8BEN-E to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign entity receiving a withholdable payment from a withholding agent, receiving a payment subject to chapter 3 withholding, or if you are an entity maintaining an account with an FFI requesting this form.\\nDo not use Form W-8BEN-E if:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are a U.S. person (including U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and entities treated as U.S. persons, such as a corporation organized under the law of a state). Instead, use Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification.\\n\\n\\nYou are a foreign insurance company that has made an election under section 953(d) to be treated as a U.S. person. Instead, provide a withholding agent with Form W-9 to certify to your U.S. status even if you are considered an FFI for purposes of chapter 4.\\n\\n\\nYou are a nonresident alien individual. Instead, use Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals), or Form 8233, Exemption From Withholding on Compensation for Independent (and Certain Dependent) Personal Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual, as applicable.\\n\\n\\nYou are a disregarded entity, branch, or flow-through entity for U.S. tax purposes. However, you may use this form if you are a disregarded entity or flow-through entity using this form either solely to document your chapter 4 status (because you hold an account with an FFI) or, if you are a disregarded entity or a partnership, to claim treaty benefits because you are a hybrid entity liable to tax as a resident for treaty purposes. See Special Instructions for Hybrid Entities, later. A flow-through entity may also use this form for purposes of documenting itself as a participating payee for purposes of section 6050W. If you are a disregarded entity with a single owner or branch of an FFI, the single owner, if such owner is a foreign person, should provide Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (as appropriate). If the single owner is a U.S. person, a Form W-9 should be provided. If you are a partnership, you should provide a Form W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting.\\n\\n\\nYou are acting as an intermediary (that is, acting not for your own account, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian), a qualified intermediary (including a qualified intermediary acting as a qualified derivatives dealer), or a qualified securities lender (QSL). Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.\\n\\n\\nYou are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, unless it is allocable to you through a partnership. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person’s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States. If any of the income for which you have provided a Form W-8BEN-E becomes effectively connected, this is a change in circumstances and the Form W-8BEN-E is no longer valid.\\n\\n\\nYou are filing for a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Instead, provide Form W-8EXP, Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting, to certify to your exemption and identify your chapter 4 status. However, you should provide Form W-8BEN-E if you are claiming treaty benefits, and you may provide this form if you are only claiming you are a foreign person exempt from backup withholding or documenting your chapter 4 status. For example, a foreign tax-exempt organization under section 501(c) receiving royalty income that is not exempt because it is taxable as unrelated business income but that is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding under a royalty article of a tax treaty should provide Form W-8BEN-E. You should use Form W-8ECI if you are receiving effectively connected income (for example, income from commercial activities that is not exempt under an applicable section of the Code).\\n\\n\\nYou are a foreign reverse hybrid entity transmitting documentation provided by your interest holders to claim treaty benefits on their behalf. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. A foreign reverse hybrid entity also may not use this form to attempt to claim treaty benefits on its own behalf. See Foreign Reverse Hybrid Entities, later.\\n\\n\\nYou are a withholding foreign partnership or a withholding foreign trust within the meaning of sections 1441 and 1442 and the accompanying regulations. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.\\n\\n\\nYou are a foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust providing documentation for purposes of section 1446. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY and accompanying documentation.\\n\\n\\nYou are a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution that is an FFI (other than a qualified intermediary branch) under an applicable Model 1 IGA. For purposes of identifying yourself to withholding agents, you may submit Form W-9 to certify to your U.S. status.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nGiving Form W-8BEN-E to the withholding agent.\\nDo not send Form W-8BEN-E to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. An FFI may also request this form from you to document the status of your account.\\n\\n\\nWhen to provide Form W-8BEN-E to the withholding agent.\\nGive Form W-8BEN-E to the person requesting it before the payment is made to you, credited to your account, or allocated. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold at the 30% rate (as applicable under chapters 3 or 4), backup withholding rate, or the rate applicable under section 1446. If you receive more than one type of income from a single withholding agent for which you claim different benefits, the withholding agent may, at its option, require you to submit a Form W-8BEN-E for each type of income. Generally, a separate Form W-8BEN-E must be given to each withholding agent. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nNote.\\nIf you own the income with one or more other persons, the income will be treated by the withholding agent as owned by a foreign person that is a beneficial owner of a payment only if Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable document) is provided by each of the owners. An account will be treated as a U.S. account for chapter 4 purposes by an FFI requesting this form if any of the account holders is a specified U.S. person or a U.S.-owned foreign entity (unless the account is otherwise excepted from U.S. account status for chapter 4 purposes).\\n\\n\\n\\nChange in circumstances.\\nIf a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8BEN-E you have submitted incorrect for purposes of either chapter 3 or chapter 4, you must notify the withholding agent or financial institution maintaining your account within 30 days of the change in circumstances by providing the documentation required in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E)(2). See Regulations sections 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for the definition of change in circumstances for purposes of chapter 3, and 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E) for purposes of chapter 4. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith respect to an FFI claiming a chapter 4 status under an applicable IGA, a change in circumstances includes when the jurisdiction where the FFI is organized or resident (or the jurisdiction identified in Part II of the form) was included on the list of jurisdictions treated as having an intergovernmental agreement in effect and is removed from that list or when the FATCA status of the jurisdiction changes (for example, from Model 2 to Model 1). The list of agreements is maintained at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx.\\n\\nExpiration of Form W-8BEN-E.\\nGenerally, a Form W-8BEN-E will remain valid for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4 for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year, unless a change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8BEN signed on September 30, 2014, remains valid through December 31, 2017. \\nHowever, under certain conditions a Form W-8BEN-E will remain in effect indefinitely absent a change of circumstances. See Regulations sections 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii) and 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii) for the period of validity for chapters 3 and 4 purposes, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDefinitions\\n\\nAccount holder.\\nAn account holder is generally the person listed or identified as the holder or owner of a financial account. For example, if a partnership is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, then the partnership is the account holder, rather than the partners of the partnership. However, an account that is held by a disregarded entity (other than a disregarded entity treated as an FFI for chapter 4 purposes) is treated as held by the entity\\'s single owner.\\n\\n\\nAmounts subject to chapter 3 withholding.\\nGenerally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. Amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding do not include amounts that are not FDAP, such as most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID). \\nFor purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. \\n\\n\\nBeneficial owner.\\nFor payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income. \\nForeign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. \\nFor purposes of section 1446, the same beneficial owner rules apply, except that under section 1446 a foreign simple trust rather than the beneficiary provides the form to the partnership.\\nThe beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNote.\\nA payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee that is not subject to 30% withholding for purposes of chapters 3 and 4. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. For purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust or disregarded entity shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9 in its own right. Rather, the grantor or other owner shall provide the withholding agent the appropriate form.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3.\\nChapter 3 means chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.\\n\\n\\nChapter 4.\\nChapter 4 means chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 status.\\nThe term chapter 4 status means a person’s status as a U.S. person, specified U.S. person, foreign individual, participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, restricted distributor, exempt beneficial owner, nonparticipating FFI, territory financial institution, excepted NFFE, or passive NFFE. \\n\\n\\nDeemed-compliant FFI.\\nUnder section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a GIIN. These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1). \\n\\n\\nDisregarded entity.\\nA business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. Generally, a disregarded entity does not submit this Form W-8BEN-E to a withholding agent. Instead, the owner of such entity provides the appropriate documentation (for example, a Form W-8BEN-E if the owner is a foreign entity). However, if a disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment is an FFI outside the single owner’s country of organization or has its own GIIN, its foreign owner will be required to complete Part II of Form W-8BEN-E to document the chapter 4 status of the disregarded entity receiving the payment. \\nCertain entities that are disregarded for U.S. tax purposes may be treated as treaty residents for purposes of claiming treaty benefits under an applicable tax treaty or may be recognized as FFIs under an applicable IGA. A hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf is required to complete Form W-8BEN-E. See Hybrid Entities under Special Instructions, later.\\nA disregarded entity with a U.S. owner or a disregarded entity with a foreign owner that is not otherwise able to fill out Part II (that is, because it is in the same country as its single owner and does not have a GIIN) may provide this form to an FFI solely for purposes of documenting itself for chapter 4 purposes. In such a case, the disregarded entity should complete Part I as if it were a beneficial owner and should not complete line 3.\\n\\n\\nFinancial account.\\nA financial account includes: \\n\\n\\n\\nA depository account maintained by an FFI;\\n\\n\\nA custodial account maintained by an FFI;\\n\\n\\nEquity or debt interests (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market) in investment entities and certain holding companies, treasury centers, or financial institutions as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e);\\n\\n\\nCertain cash value insurance contracts; and\\n\\n\\nAnnuity contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor purposes of chapter 4, exceptions are provided for accounts such as certain tax-favored savings accounts, term life insurance contracts, accounts held by estates, escrow accounts, and certain annuity contracts. These exceptions are subject to certain conditions. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2). Accounts may also be excluded from the definition of financial account under an applicable IGA.\\n\\n\\nFinancial institution.\\nA financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(e).\\nAn investment entity organized in a territory that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company is not treated as a financial institution. Instead, it is a territory NFFE. If such an entity cannot qualify as an excepted NFFE as described in Regulations section 1.1472-1(c)(1) (including an excepted territory NFFE), it must disclose its substantial U.S. owners using this definition (applying the 10 percent threshold) under Regulations section 1.1473-1(b)(1). \\n\\n\\nForeign financial institution (FFI).\\nA foreign financial institution (FFI) means a foreign entity that is a financial institution. \\n\\n\\nFiscally transparent entity.\\nAn entity is treated as fiscally transparent with respect to an item of income for which treaty benefits are claimed to the extent that the interest holders in the entity must, on a current basis, take into account separately their shares of an item of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed, and must determine the character of the items of income as if they were realized directly from the sources from which realized by the entity. For example, partnerships, common trust funds, and simple trusts or grantor trusts are generally considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to items of income received by them.\\n\\n\\nFlow-through entity.\\nA flow-through entity is a foreign partnership (other than a withholding foreign partnership), a foreign simple or foreign grantor trust (other than a withholding foreign trust), or, for payments for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, any entity to the extent the entity is considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to the payment by an interest holder’s jurisdiction. \\n\\n\\nForeign person.\\nA foreign person includes a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign person. \\n\\n\\nGIIN.\\nThe term GIIN means a global intermediary identification number. A GIIN is the identification number assigned to an entity that has registered with the IRS for chapter 4 purposes. \\n\\n\\nHybrid entity.\\nA hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of its status under the Code but is not treated as fiscally transparent by a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. Hybrid entity status is relevant for claiming treaty benefits. A hybrid entity is required to provide its chapter 4 status if it is receiving a withholdable payment. \\n\\n\\nIntergovernmental agreement (IGA).\\nAn intergovernmental agreement (IGA) means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, see www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx.\\nA Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI.\\nA Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that has entered into an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is a participating FFI but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI. \\nThe term reporting IGA FFI refers to both reporting Model 1 FFIs and reporting Model 2 FFIs.\\n\\n\\nNonparticipating FFI.\\nA nonparticipating FFI means an FFI that is not a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or exempt beneficial owner.\\n\\n\\nNonreporting IGA FFI.\\nA nonreporting IGA FFI is an FFI that is a resident of, or located or established in, a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that meets the requirements of:\\n\\n\\n\\nA nonreporting financial institution described in a specific category in Annex II of the Model 1 or Model 2 IGA;\\n\\n\\nA registered deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(A) through (F); \\n\\n\\nA certified deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(2)(i) through (v); or \\n\\n\\nAn exempt beneficial owner described in Regulations section 1.1471-6.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nParticipating FFI.\\nA participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term participating FFI also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI.\\n\\n\\nParticipating payee.\\nA participating payee means any person that accepts a payment card as payment or accepts payment from a third party settlement organization in settlement of a third party network transaction for purposes of section 6050W.\\n\\n\\nPayee.\\nA payee is generally a person to whom a payment is made regardless of whether such person is the beneficial owner. For a payment made to a financial account, the payee is generally the holder of the financial account. See Regulations sections 1.1441-1(b)(2) and 1.1471-3(a)(3).\\n\\n\\nPayment settlement entity (PSE).\\nA payment settlement entity is a merchant acquiring entity or third party settlement organization. Under section 6050W, a PSE is generally required to report payments made in settlement of payment card transactions or third party network transactions. However, a PSE is not required to report payments made to a beneficial owner that is documented as foreign with an applicable Form W-8. \\n\\n\\nQualified intermediary (QI).\\nA qualified intermediary (QI) is a person that is a party to an agreement with the IRS that is described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii). A qualified derivatives dealer (QDD) is a QI that has agreed to certain reporting and withholding requirements pursuant to Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6).\\n\\n\\nRecalcitrant account holder.\\nA recalcitrant account holder includes an entity (other than an entity required to be treated as a nonparticipating FFI) that fails to comply with a request by an FFI maintaining the account for documentation and information for determining whether the account is a U.S. account. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(g). \\n\\n\\nReverse hybrid entity.\\nA reverse hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is not fiscally transparent under U.S. tax law principles but that is fiscally transparent under the laws of a jurisdiction with which the United States has an income tax treaty. See Form W-8IMY and the accompanying instructions for information on a reverse hybrid entity making a claim of treaty benefits on behalf of its owners. \\n\\n\\nSpecified U.S. person.\\nA specified U.S. person is any U.S. person other than a person identified in Regulations section 1.1473-1(c). \\n\\n\\nSubstantial U.S. owner.\\nA substantial U.S. owner (as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(b)) means any specified U.S. person that:\\n\\n\\n\\nOwns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent (by vote or value) of the stock of any foreign corporation;\\n\\n\\nOwns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the profits or capital interests in a foreign partnership;\\n\\n\\nIs treated as an owner of any portion of a foreign trust under sections 671 through 679; or\\n\\n\\nHolds, directly or indirectly, more than a 10 percent beneficial interest in a trust. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nU.S. person.\\nA U.S. person is defined in section 7701(a)(30) and includes domestic partnerships, corporations, and trusts.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCertain foreign insurance companies issuing annuities or cash value insurance contracts that elect to be treated as a U.S. person for federal tax purposes but are not licensed to do business in the United States are treated as FFIs for purposes of chapter 4. For purposes of providing a withholding agent with documentation for both chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes, however, such an insurance company is permitted to use Form W-9 to certify its status as a U.S. person. Likewise, a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution (other than a branch that operates as a qualified intermediary) that is treated as an FFI under an applicable IGA is permitted to use Form W-9 to certify its status as a U.S. person for chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes.\\n\\n\\nWithholdable payment.\\nA withholdable payment is defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a). For exceptions applicable to the definition of a withholdable payment, see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) (for example, certain nonfinancial payments). \\n\\n\\nWithholding agent.\\nAny person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or 4 withholding is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies. \\nFor purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent may be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart I – Identificationof Beneficial Owner\\n\\nLine 1.\\nEnter your name. If you are a disregarded entity or branch, do not enter your business name. Instead, enter the legal name of your owner (or, if you are a branch, the entity that you form a part of) (looking through multiple disregarded entities if applicable). If you are a disregarded entity that is a hybrid entity filing a treaty claim, however, see Hybrid entities under Special Instructions, later.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are an account holder providing this form to an FFI solely for purposes of documenting yourself as an account holder and you are not receiving a withholdable payment or reportable amount (as defined in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(3)(vi)), you should complete Part I by substituting the references to \"beneficial owner\" with \"account holder.\" \\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe named holder on the account is not necessarily the account holder for purposes of chapter 4. See Definitions, earlier, or, for an account maintained by an FFI covered by a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA with respect to the account, the definition of account holder in an applicable IGA to determine if you are the account holder. If you hold an account with an FFI and are unsure whether the definition of \"account holder\" under an IGA is applicable to your account, consult with the FFI requesting this form.\\n\\n\\nLine 2.\\nIf you are a corporation, enter your country of incorporation. If you are another type of entity, enter the country under whose laws you are created, organized, or governed. \\n\\n\\nLine 3.\\nIf you are a disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment, enter your name on line 3 if you: 1) have registered with the IRS and been assigned a GIIN associated with the legal name of the disregarded entity; 2) are a reporting Model 1 FFI or reporting Model 2 FFI; and 3) are not a hybrid entity using this form to claim treaty benefits. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are not required to provide the legal name of the disregarded entity, you may want to notify the withholding agent that you are a disregarded entity receiving a payment or maintaining an account by indicating the name of the disregarded entity on line 10. If you wish to report the name of a disregarded entity holding an account with the withholding agent requesting this form for only information purposes (that is, the disregarded entity is not reported on line 1 or in Part II of this form), you may enter the disregarded entity\\'s name on line 3.\\n\\nLine 4.\\nCheck the one box that applies. By checking a box, you are representing that you qualify for the classification indicated. You must check the box that represents your classification (for example, corporation, partnership, trust, estate, etc.) under U.S. tax principles (not under the law of a treaty country). If you are providing Form W-8BEN-E to an FFI solely for purposes of documenting yourself for chapter 4 purposes as an account holder of an account maintained by an FFI, you do not need to complete line 4.\\nIf you are a partnership, disregarded entity, simple trust, or grantor trust receiving a payment for which treaty benefits are being claimed by such entity, you must check the \"Partnership,\" \"Disregarded entity,\" \"Simple trust,\" or \"Grantor trust\" box. For such a case, you must also check the \"yes\" box to indicate that you are a hybrid entity making a treaty claim. You may only check the \"no\" box if (1) you are a disregarded entity, partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust and are using the form solely for purposes of documenting yourself as an account holder of an FFI and the form is not associated with a withholdable payment or a reportable amount or (2) you are using this form solely for purposes of documenting your status as a participating payee for purposes of section 6050W. In such cases, you are not required to complete line 4, but you may check the \"no\" box if you choose to complete line 4. You may also use Form W-8IMY to document yourself as an account holder of an FFI.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOnly entities that are tax-exempt under section 501(c) should check the \"Tax-exempt organization\" box for purposes of line 4. Such organizations should use Form W-8BEN-E only if they are claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty or a Code exception other than section 501(c) or if they are using this form solely for purposes of documenting themselves as an account holder with an FFI. However, if you are a private foundation you should check “Private Foundation” instead of \"Tax-exempt organization.\" \\n\\n\\nLine 5.\\nCheck the one box that applies to your chapter 4 status. You are only required to provide a chapter 4 status on this form if you are the payee of a withholdable payment or are documenting the status of a financial account you hold with an FFI requesting this form. By checking a box on this line, you are representing that you qualify for this classification in your country of residence. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor most of the chapter 4 statuses, you are required to complete an additional part of this form certifying that you meet the conditions of the status indicated on line 5. Complete the required portion of this form before signing and providing it to the withholding agent. See Entities Providing Certifications Under an Applicable IGA under Special Instructions, later.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFFIs Covered by an IGA and Related Entities\\nA reporting IGA FFI resident in, or established under the laws of, a jurisdiction covered by a Model 1 IGA should check \"Reporting Model 1 FFI.\" A reporting FFI resident in, or established under the laws of, a jurisdiction covered by a Model 2 IGA should check \"Reporting Model 2 FFI.\" If you are treated as a registered deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA, you should check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI\" rather than \"registered deemed-compliant FFI\" and provide your GIIN.\\nIn general, if you are treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI under an applicable IGA, you should check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI\" even if you meet the qualifications for deemed-compliant status or are an exempt beneficial owner under the chapter 4 regulations. In such a case, you should not also check your applicable status under the regulations but should provide your GIIN on line 9, if applicable. If you are an owner-documented FFI that is treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI under an applicable IGA you must check \"Owner-documented FFI\" and complete Part X.\\nAn FFI that is related to a reporting IGA FFI and that is treated as a nonparticipating FFI in its country of residence should check \"Nonparticipating FFI\" in line 5.\\nIf you are an FFI in a jurisdiction treated as having an IGA in effect, you should not check \"Participating FFI\" but rather should check \"Reporting Model 1 FFI\" or \"Reporting Model 2 FFI\" as applicable. See www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx  for a list of jurisdictions treated as having an IGA in effect.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNon-Profit Organizations Covered by an IGA\\nIf you are a non-profit entity that is established and maintained in a jurisdiction treated as having an IGA in effect and you meet the definition of \"active NFFE\"under Annex I of the applicable IGA, you should not check a box on line 5 if you are providing this form to an FFI for purposes of documenting yourself as an account holder. Instead, you should provide a certification of your status under the IGA. See Entities Providing Certifications Under an Applicable IGA under Special Instructions, later.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAccount That Is Not a Financial Account\\nIf you are providing this form to document an account you hold with a foreign financial institution that is not a financial account under Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2), check the \"Account that is not a financial account\" box on line 5.\\n\\nLine 6.\\nEnter the permanent residence address of the entity identified in line 1. Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for purposes of that country’s income tax. If you are giving Form W-8BEN-E to claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding under an income tax treaty, you must determine residency in the manner required by the treaty. Do not show the address of a financial institution (unless you are a financial institution providing your own address), a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless it is the only address you use and it appears in your organizational documents (that is, your registered address). If you do not have a tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is where you maintain your principal office. \\n\\n\\nLine 7.\\nEnter your mailing address only if it is different from the address on line 6. \\n\\n\\nLine 8.\\nEnter your U.S. employer identification number (EIN). An EIN is a U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN) for entities. If you do not have a U.S. EIN, apply for one on Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, if you are required to obtain a U.S. TIN. \\nA partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States will likely be allocated effectively connected taxable income. The partner is required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and must have a TIN. \\nYou must provide a U.S. TIN if you are: \\n\\n\\n\\nClaiming an exemption from withholding under section 871(f) for certain annuities received under qualified plans, or\\n\\n\\nClaiming benefits under an income tax treaty and have not provided a foreign TIN on line 9b.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHowever, a TIN is not required to be shown in order to claim treaty benefits on the following items of income: \\n\\n\\n\\nDividends and interest from stocks and debt obligations that are actively traded;\\n\\n\\nDividends from any redeemable security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (mutual fund);\\n\\n\\nDividends, interest, or royalties from units of beneficial interest in a unit investment trust that are (or were upon issuance) publicly offered and are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933; and\\n\\n\\nIncome related to loans of any of the above securities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSee Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vii) for other circumstances when you are required to provide a U.S. TIN.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you need an EIN, you are encouraged to apply for one online instead of submitting a paper Form SS-4. For more information, visit IRS.gov/EIN.\\n\\n\\nLine 9a.\\nIf you are a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a sponsored FFI described in the Treasury regulations), reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, direct reporting NFFE, trustee of a trustee-documented trust that is a foreign person providing this form for the trust, or sponsored direct reporting NFFE, you are required to enter your GIIN (with regard to your country of residence) on line 9a. If you are a trustee of a trustee-documented trust and you are a foreign person, you should provide the GIIN that you received when you registered as a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI. If your branch is receiving the payment and is required to be identified in Part II, you are not required to provide a GIIN on line 9a. Instead, provide the GIIN of your branch (if applicable) on line 13. \\nYou must provide your GIIN on line 9 if you are a nonreporting IGA FFI that is (1) treated as registered deemed-compliant under Annex II to an applicable Model 2 IGA or (2) a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are in the process of registering with the IRS as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a sponsored FFI), reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, direct reporting NFFE, sponsored direct reporting NFFE, or nonreporting IGA FFI but have not received a GIIN, you may complete this line by writing “applied for.” However, the person requesting this form from you must receive and verify your GIIN within 90 days.\\n\\n\\nLine 9b.\\nIf you are providing this Form W-8BEN-E to document yourself as an account holder with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the TIN issued to you by the jurisdiction in which you are a tax resident identified on line 6 unless:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs) , or \\n\\n\\nYou properly identified yourself as a government, central bank of issue, or international organization on line 4, or you are a resident of a U.S. possession.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 9b, and you are not a government, central bank of issue, international organization, or resident of a U.S. possession, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. The explanation may be written on line 9b, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If you are writing the explanation on line 9b, you may shorten it to \"not legally required.\" Do not write “not applicable.” \\nIn addition, if you are not using this form to document a financial account described above, you may provide the TIN issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence on line 9b for purposes of claiming treaty benefits (rather than providing a U.S. TIN on line 6b, if required).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLines 9a and 9b should accommodate the GIIN or foreign TIN, as appropriate. You may need to use a smaller font when completing the form. If the GIIN or foreign TIN does not fit in the space provided, you may provide a GIIN or foreign TIN that is indicated and clearly identified somewhere else on the form, or on a separate attached sheet, as long as the GIIN or foreign TIN is clearly identified as being furnished with respect to line 9a or 9b, respectively. For example, a handwritten GIIN located just outside of line 9a with a corresponding arrow pointing to line 9a is a properly provided GIIN for this purpose.\\n\\n\\nLine 10.\\nThis line may be used by you or by the withholding agent or FFI to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent to document the beneficial owner. For example, withholding agents who are required to associate the Form W-8BEN-E with a particular Form W-8IMY may want to use line 10 for a referencing number or code that will make the association clear. You may also want to use line 10 to include the number of the account for which you are providing the form. If you are a single owner of a disregarded entity you may use line 10 to inform the withholding agent that the account to which a payment is made or credited is held in the name of the disregarded entity (unless the name of the disregarded entity is required to be provided on line 3). \\nYou may also use line 10 to identify income from a notional principal contract that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart II – Disregarded Entityor Branch Receiving Payment\\nComplete Part II for a disregarded entity that has its own GIIN and is receiving a withholdable payment, or for a branch (including a branch that is a disregarded entity that does not have a GIIN) operating in a jurisdiction other than the country of residence identified in line 2. For example, assume ABC Co., which is a participating FFI resident in Country A, operates through a branch in Country B (which is a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction) and the branch is treated as a reporting Model 1 FFI under the terms of the Country B Model 1 IGA. ABC Co. should not enter its GIIN on line 9, and the Country B branch should complete this Part II by identifying itself as a reporting Model 1 IGA FFI and providing its GIIN on line 13. If the Country B branch receiving the payment is a disregarded entity you may be required to provide its legal name on line 3.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf the disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment has its own GIIN, Part II should be completed regardless of whether it is in the same country as the single owner identified in Part I.\\nIf you have multiple branches/disregarded entities receiving payments from the same withholding agent and the information in Part I is the same for each branch/disregarded entity that will receive payments, a withholding agent may accept a single Form W-8BEN-E from you with a schedule attached that includes all of the Part II information for each branch/disregarded entity rather than separate Forms W-8BEN-E to identify each branch/disregarded entity receiving payments associated with the form and an allocation of the payment to each branch/disregarded entity.\\n\\nLine 11.\\nCheck the one box that applies. If no box applies to the disregarded entity, you do not need to complete this part. If you check reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, or participating FFI, you must complete line 13 (see below). If your branch is a branch of a reporting IGA FFI that cannot comply with the requirements of an applicable IGA or the regulations under chapter 4 (a related entity), you must check \"Branch treated as nonparticipating FFI.\"\\n\\n\\nLine 12.\\nEnter the address of the branch or disregarded entity. \\n\\n\\nLine 13.\\nIf you are a reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, or participating FFI, you must enter the GIIN on line 13 of your branch that receives the payment. If you are a disregarded entity that completed Part I, line 3 of this form and are receiving payments associated with this form, enter your GIIN. Do not enter your GIIN on line 9. If you are a U.S. branch, enter a GIIN applicable to any other branch of the FFI (including in its residence country).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are in the process of registering your branch with the IRS but have not received a GIIN, you may complete this line by writing \"applied for.\" However, the person requesting this form from you must receive and verify your GIIN within 90 days.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart III – Claim of Tax Treaty Benefits\\n\\nLine 14a.\\nIf you are claiming a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding under an income tax treaty you must enter the country where you are a resident for income tax treaty purposes and check the box to certify that you are a resident of that country.\\n\\n\\nLine 14b.\\nIf you are claiming a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding under an income tax treaty you must check the box to certify that you:\\n\\n\\n\\nDerive the item of income for which the treaty benefit is claimed, and\\n\\n\\nMeet the limitation on benefits provision contained in the treaty, if any.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAn item of income may be derived by either the entity receiving the item of income or by the interest holders in the entity or, in certain circumstances, both. An item of income paid to an entity is considered to be derived by the entity only if the entity is not fiscally transparent under the laws of the entity’s jurisdiction with respect to the item of income. An item of income paid to an entity shall be considered to be derived by the interest holder in the entity only if: \\n\\n\\n\\nThe interest holder is not fiscally transparent in its jurisdiction with respect to the item of income, and\\n\\n\\nThe entity is considered to be fiscally transparent under the laws of the interest holder’s jurisdiction with respect to the item of income. An item of income paid directly to a type of entity specifically identified in a treaty as a resident of a treaty jurisdiction is treated as derived by a resident of that treaty jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLimitation on benefits treaty provisions.\\nIf you are a resident of a foreign country that has entered into an income tax treaty with the United States that contains a limitation on benefits (LOB) article, you must complete one of the checkboxes in line 14b. You may only check a box if the limitation on benefits article in that treaty includes a provision that corresponds to the checkbox on which you are relying to claim treaty benefits. A particular treaty might not include every type of test for which a checkbox is provided. For example, \"Company that meets the derivative benefits test\" is generally not available to a company resident in a treaty country that is not a member of the EU, EEA, or NAFTA. In addition, each treaty LOB article that contains a specific test listed below may have particular requirements that must be met that differ from the requirements in another treaty with regard to the same test. Accordingly, you must check the relevant treaty LOB article for the particular requirements associated with each test. In general, only one LOB checkbox is required to claim a treaty exemption even if more than one checkbox would suffice to claim the benefits of the treaty for that item of income.\\nEach of the tests is summarized below for your general convenience but may not be relied upon for making a final determination that you meet an LOB test. Rather you must check the text of the LOB article itself to determine which tests are available under that treaty and the particular requirements of those tests. See Table 4, Limitation on Benefits, at IRS.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Tax-Treaty-Tables, for a summary of the major tests within the Limitation on Benefits article that are relevant for documenting any entity\\'s claim for treaty benefits.\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernment—this test is met if the entity is the Contracting State, political subdivision, or local authority.\\n\\n\\nTax-exempt pension trust or pension fund—this test generally requires that more than half the beneficiaries or participants in the trust or fund be residents of the country of residence of the trust or fund itself.\\n\\n\\nOther tax-exempt organization—this test generally requires that more than half the beneficiaries, members, or participants of religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, cultural, or educational organizations be residents of the country of residence of the organization.\\n\\n\\nPublicly-traded corporation—this test generally requires the corporation\\'s principal class of shares to be primarily and regularly traded on a recognized stock exchange in its country of residence, while other treaties may permit trading in either the United States or the treaty country, or in certain third countries if the primary place of management is the country of residence.\\n\\n\\nSubsidiary of publicly-traded corporation—this test generally requires that more than 50% of the vote and value of the company\\'s shares be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer companies that are publicly-traded corporations and that themselves meet the publicly-traded corporation test, as long as all companies in the chain of ownership are resident in either the United States or the same country of residence as the subsidiary.\\n\\n\\nCompany that meets the ownership and base erosion test—this test generally requires that more than 50% of the vote and value of the company\\'s shares be owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals, governments, tax-exempt entities, and publicly-traded corporations resident in the same country as the company, as long as all companies in the chain of ownership are resident in the same country of residence, and less than 50% of the company\\'s gross income is accrued or paid, directly or indirectly, to persons who would not be good shareholders for purposes of the ownership test.\\n\\n\\nCompany that meets the derivative benefits test—this test is generally limited to NAFTA, EU, and EEA country treaties, and may apply to all benefits or only to certain items of income (interest, dividends, and royalties). It generally requires that more than 95% of the aggregate vote and value of the company\\'s shares be owned, directly or indirectly, by seven or fewer equivalent beneficiaries (ultimate owners who are resident in an EU, EEA, or NAFTA country and are entitled to identical benefits under their own treaty with the United States under one of the ownership tests included within the LOB article (other than the stock ownership and base erosion test)). In addition, this test requires that less than 50% of the company\\'s gross income be paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, to persons who would not be equivalent beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\nCompany with an item of income that meets the active trade or business test—this test generally requires that the company be engaged in an active trade or business in its country of residence, that its activities in that country be substantial in relation to its U.S. activities, if the payer is a related party, and the income be derived in connection to or incidental to that trade or business.\\n\\n\\nFavorable discretionary determination received—this test requires that the company obtain a favorable determination granting benefits from the U.S. competent authority that, despite the company\\'s failure to meet a specific objective LOB test in the applicable treaty, it may nonetheless claim the requested benefits. Unless a treaty or technical explanation specifically provides otherwise, you may not claim discretionary benefits while your claim for discretionary benefits is pending.\\n\\n\\nOther—for other LOB tests that are not listed above (for example, a headquarters test). Identify the other test relied upon, or enter N/A if the treaty has no LOB article. For example, if you meet the headquarters test under the United States-Netherlands income tax treaty, you should write \"Headquarters test, Article 26(5)\" in the space provided.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf an entity is claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf, it should complete Form W-8BEN-E. If an interest holder in an entity that is considered fiscally transparent in the interest holder’s jurisdiction is claiming a treaty benefit, the interest holder should complete Form W-8BEN (if an individual) or Form W-8BEN-E (if an entity) on its own behalf as the appropriate treaty resident, and the fiscally transparent entity should associate the interest holder’s Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E with a Form W-8IMY completed by the fiscally transparent entity (see Hybrid entities under Special Instructions, later).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAn income tax treaty may not apply to reduce the amount of any tax on an item of income received by an entity that is treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. tax purposes. Therefore, neither the domestic corporation nor its shareholders are entitled to the benefits of a reduction of U.S. income tax on an item of income received from U.S. sources by the corporation.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are an entity that derives the income as a resident of a treaty country, you may check this box if the applicable income tax treaty does not contain a \"limitation on benefits\" provision.\\n\\n\\nLine 14c.\\nIf you are a foreign corporation claiming treaty benefits under an income tax treaty that entered into force before January 1, 1987 (and has not been renegotiated) on (1) U.S. source dividends paid to you by another foreign corporation or (2) U.S. source interest paid to you by a U.S. trade or business of another foreign corporation, you must generally be a \"qualified resident\" of a treaty country. See section 884 for the definition of interest paid by a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation (\"branch interest\") and other applicable rules.\\nIn general, a foreign corporation is a qualified resident of a country if any of the following apply:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt meets a 50% ownership and base erosion test.\\n\\n\\nIt is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in its country of residence or the United States.\\n\\n\\nIt carries on an active trade or business in its country of residence.\\n\\n\\nIt gets a ruling from the IRS that it is a qualified resident. \\n\\n\\n\\nSee Regulations section 1.884-5 for the requirements that must be met to satisfy each of these tests.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are claiming treaty benefits under an income tax treaty entered into force after December 31, 1986, do not check box 14c. Instead, check box 14b. \\n\\n\\nLine 15.\\nLine 15 must be used only if you are claiming treaty benefits that require that you meet conditions not covered by the representations you make in line 14 (or other certifications on the form). This line is generally not applicable to claiming treaty benefits under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty or other income article, unless such article requires additional representations. For example, certain treaties allow for a zero rate on dividends for certain qualified residents provided that additional requirements are met, such as ownership percentage, ownership period, and that the resident meet a combination of tests under an applicable LOB article. You should indicate the specific treaty article and paragraph or subparagraph, as applicable. You should also use this space to set out the requirements you meet under the identified treaty article.\\nThe following are examples of persons who should complete this line:\\n\\n\\n\\nExempt organizations claiming treaty benefits under the exempt organization articles of the treaties with Canada, Mexico, Germany, and the Netherlands.\\n\\n\\nForeign corporations that are claiming a preferential rate applicable to dividends based on ownership of a specific percentage of stock in the entity paying the dividend and owning the stock for a specified period of time. Such persons should provide the percentage of ownership and the period of time they owned the stock. For example, under the United States-Italy treaty, to claim the 5% dividend rate, the Italian corporation must own 25% of the voting stock for a 12-month period. \\nIn addition, for example, if you qualify for and are claiming a zero rate on dividend payments under Article 10(3) of the United States-Germany income tax treaty, you should fill out line 15 with \"Article 10(3),\" \"0,\" and \"dividends\" in the spaces provided. In the space provided for an explanation, you may write that you are the beneficial owner of the dividends, you are a resident of Germany, you have directly owned shares representing 80% or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for the 12-month period ending on the date the entitlement to the dividend is determined, and that you satisfy the conditions of Article 28(2)(f)(aa) and (bb) and Article 28(4) of the treaty with respect to the dividends.\\n\\n\\nPersons claiming treaty benefits on royalties if the treaty contains different withholding rates for different types of royalties.\\n\\n\\nPersons claiming treaty benefits on interest other than the generally applicable rate. For example, under the United States-Australia treaty, the generally applicable interest rate is 10% under Article 11(2). However, interest may be exempt from withholding if the specific conditions under Article 11(3) are met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nParts IV Through XXVIII –Certification of Chapter 4 Status\\nYou should complete only one part of Parts IV through XXVIII certifying to your chapter 4 status (if required). You are not required to complete a chapter 4 status certification if you are not the payee of withholdable payment or you do not hold an account with an FFI requesting this form. Identify which part (if any) you should complete by reference to the box you checked on line 5. An entity that selects nonparticipating FFI, participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI (other than a sponsored FFI), reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, or direct reporting NFFE (other than a sponsored direct reporting NFFE) on line 5 is not required to complete any of the certifications in Parts IV through XXVIII.\\n\\nIGA.\\nIn lieu of the certifications contained in Parts IV through XXVIII of Form W-8BEN-E, in certain cases you may provide an alternate certification to a withholding agent. See Entities Providing Certifications Under an Applicable IGA under Special Instructions, later. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart IV – Sponsored FFI\\n\\nLine 16.\\nIf you are a sponsored FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(F), enter the name of the sponsoring entity that has agreed to fulfill the due diligence, reporting, and withholding obligations (as applicable) on behalf of the sponsored FFI identified in line 1. You must provide your GIIN on line 9.\\n\\n\\nLine 17.\\nYou must check the applicable box to certify that you are either a sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957(a)) and that you satisfy the other relevant requirements for this status. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart V – Certified Deemed-Compliant Nonregistering Local Bank\\n\\nLine 18.\\nIf you are a certified deemed-compliant nonregistering local bank, you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this certified deemed-compliant status.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart VI – Certified Deemed-Compliant FFI With Only Low-Value Accounts\\n\\nLine 19.\\nIf you are a certified deemed-compliant FFI with only low-value accounts, you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this certified deemed-compliant classification.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart VII – Certified Deemed-Compliant Sponsored, CloselyHeld Investment Vehicle\\n\\nLine 20.\\nEnter the name of your sponsoring entity that has agreed to fulfill the due diligence, reporting, and withholding obligations of the entity identified in line 1 as if the entity in line 1 were a participating FFI. You must also enter the GIIN of your sponsoring entity on line 9a. \\n\\n\\nLine 21.\\nIf you are a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle, you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this certified deemed-compliant status.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart VIII – Certified Deemed-CompliantLimited Life DebtInvestment Company\\n\\nLine 22.\\nIf you are a limited life debt investment entity, you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this certified deemed-compliant status.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart IX – Certain Investment Entities That Do Not Maintain FinancialAccounts\\n\\nLine 23.\\nIf you are an FFI that is a financial institution solely because you are described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)(4)(i)(A) and you do not maintain financial accounts, you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this certified deemed-compliant status.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart X – Owner-Documented FFI\\n\\nLine 24a.\\nIf you are an owner-documented FFI, you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status and are providing this form to a U.S. financial institution, participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or reporting Model 2 FFI that agrees to act as a designated withholding agent with respect to you. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(3) for more information about an owner-documented FFI, including with respect to a designated withholding agent.\\n\\n\\nLine 24b.\\nCheck the box to certify that you have provided or will provide the documentation set forth in the certifications, including the FFI owner reporting statement and the valid documentation for each person identified on the FFI owner reporting statement described on line 24b.\\n\\n\\nLine 24c.\\nCheck the box to certify that you have provided or will provide the auditor’s letter (in lieu of the information required by line 24b) that satisfies the requirements reflected on this line.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCheck either line 24b or line 24c. Do not check both boxes.\\n\\nLine 24d.\\nCheck the box if you do not have any contingent beneficiaries or designated classes with unidentified beneficiaries. While this certification is not required, an owner reporting statement provided by an owner-documented FFI will remain valid indefinitely for chapter 4 purposes absent a change in circumstances with respect to offshore obligations (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)) only if this certification is provided and the account balance of all accounts held by the owner-documented FFI with the withholding agent does not exceed $1,000,000 on the later of June 30, 2014, or the last day of the calendar year in which the account was opened, and the last day of each subsequent calendar year preceding the payment, applying the account aggregation rules of Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XI – Restricted Distributor\\n\\nLine 25a.\\nIf you are a restricted distributor you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status. \\n\\n\\nLines 25b and 25c.\\nCheck the appropriate box to certify your status. Do not check both boxes. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nA restricted distributor may certify only with respect to an account it maintains in connection with a distribution agreement with a restricted fund. A restricted distributor that, in connection with such a distribution agreement, receives a payment subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment should complete Form W-8IMY and not this form except to the extent it holds interests in connection with such an agreement as a beneficial owner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XII – Nonreporting IGA FFI\\n\\nLine 26.\\nCheck the box to indicate that you are treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI. You must identify the IGA by entering the name of the jurisdiction that has the IGA treated as in effect with the United States, and indicate whether it is a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA. You must also provide the withholding agent with the specific category of FFI described in Annex II of the IGA. In providing the specific category of FFI described in Annex II, you should use the language from Annex II that best and most specifically describes your status. For example, indicate \"investment entity wholly owned by exempt beneficial owners\" rather than \"exempt beneficial owner.\" If you are a nonreporting IGA FFI claiming a deemed-compliant status under the regulations, you must instead indicate on this line which section of the regulations you qualify under.\\nIf you are a nonreporting financial institution under an applicable IGA because you qualify as an owner-documented FFI under the regulations, do not check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI.\" Instead, you must check \"Owner-documented FFI\" and complete Part X rather than this Part XII.\\nSee instructions for line 9a for when a GIIN is required for a nonreporting IGA FFI (including a trustee of a trustee-documented trust that is a foreign person).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XIII – Foreign Government, Government of a U.S. Possession, or Foreign Central Bank of Issue\\n\\nLine 27.\\nIf you are a foreign government or political subdivision of a foreign government (including wholly owned agencies and instrumentalities thereof), government of a U.S. possession, or foreign central bank of issue (each as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-6) you must check the box and certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status (including that you do not engage in the type of commercial financial activities described on this line except to the extent permitted under Regulations section 1.1471-6(h)(2)). \\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are a foreign government or political subdivision of a foreign government (including wholly owned agencies and instrumentalities thereof), government of a U.S. possession, or foreign central bank of issue, you should only complete Form W-8BEN-E for payments for which you are not claiming the applicability of section(s) 115(2), 892, or 895; otherwise you should use Form W-8EXP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XIV – International Organization\\n\\nLine 28a.\\nCheck this box to certify that you are an international organization described in section 7701(a)(18). \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are an entity that has been designated as an international organization by executive order (pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 288 through 288f), check box 28a. If you are claiming an exemption from withholding for purposes of chapter 3, however, use Form W-8EXP.\\n\\nLine 28b.\\nIf you are an international organization other than an international organization described in line 28a, you must check the box to certify that you satisfy all of the requirements for this status. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XV – Exempt Retirement Plans\\n\\nLines 29a, b, c, d, e, and f.\\nIf you are an exempt retirement plan you must check the appropriate box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XVI – Entity Wholly Ownedby Exempt Beneficial Owners\\n\\nLine 30.\\nIf you are an entity wholly owned by exempt beneficial owners you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status. You must also provide the owner documentation described in this line establishing that each of your direct owners or debt holders is an exempt beneficial owner described in Regulations section 1.1471-6(b).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XVII – TerritoryFinancial Institution\\n\\nLine 31.\\nIf you are a territory financial institution you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XVIII – Excepted Nonfinancial Group Entity\\n\\nLine 32.\\nIf you are an excepted nonfinancial group entity you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XIX – Excepted Nonfinancial Start-Up Company\\n\\nLine 33.\\nIf you are an excepted nonfinancial start-up company you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status. You must also provide the date you were formed or your board passed a resolution (or equivalent measure) approving a new line of business (which cannot be that of a financial institution or passive NFFE). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XX – Excepted Nonfinancial Entity in Liquidation or Bankruptcy\\n\\nLine 34.\\nIf you are an excepted nonfinancial group entity in liquidation or bankruptcy you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status. You must also provide the date that you filed a plan of liquidation, plan of reorganization, or bankruptcy petition. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XXI – 501(c) Organization\\n\\nLine 35.\\nIf you are an entity claiming chapter 4 status as a section 501(c) organization pursuant to Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)(5)(v) you must check the box and provide the date that the IRS issued you a determination letter or provide a copy of an opinion from U.S. counsel certifying that you qualify as a section 501(c) organization (without regard to whether you are a foreign private foundation).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are a section 501(c) organization claiming an exemption from withholding for purposes of chapter 3, however, use Form W-8EXP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XXII – Nonprofit Organization\\n\\nLine 36.\\nIf you are a nonprofit organization (other than an entity claiming chapter 4 status as a section 501(c) organization pursuant to Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)(5)(v)) you must check the box to certify that you meet all of the requirements for this status.\\nNonprofit organization under an IGA. If you are an entity that is established and maintained in a jurisdiction that is treated as having in effect an IGA and you are described in Annex I as a nonprofit organization that is an Active NFFE, see Entities Providing Certifications Under an Applicable IGA under Special Instructions, later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XXIII – Publicly-TradedNFFE or NFFE Affiliate ofa Publicly-Traded Corporation\\n\\nLine 37a.\\nIf you are a publicly-traded NFFE you must check the box to certify that you are not a financial institution and provide the name of a securities exchange on which your stock is publicly traded. \\n\\n\\nLine 37b.\\nIf you are an NFFE that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group as a publicly-traded U.S. or foreign entity you must check this box, provide the name of the publicly-traded entity, and identify the securities market on which the stock of the publicly- traded entity is traded.

Provide the name, address, and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner in the relevant column.

Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, may be used for this purpose. The agent, as well as the beneficial owner, payee, or account holder (as applicable), may incur liability for the penalties provided for an erroneous, false, or fraudulent form. By signing Form W-8BEN-E, the authorized representative, officer, or agent of the entity also agrees to provide a new form within 30 days following a change in circumstances affecting the correctness of the form.\\nA withholding agent may allow you to provide this form with an electronic signature. The electronic signature must indicate that the form was electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and statement that the form has been electronically signed).

Allocation information is not required on this withholding statement unless one or more partners or owners are subject to chapter 4 withholding (such as a nonparticipating FFI). If you are a disregarded entity claiming treaty benefits on a payment that is a withholdable payment, unless you are treated as the payee for chapter 4 purposes and have your own GIIN, your single owner should provide Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8BEN (as applicable) to the withholding agent along with this form.

       " '   Instructions for Form W-8ECI (07/2017) Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 07/2017     General Instructions  Note.  For definitions of terms used throughout these instructions, see Definitions, later.      Purpose of Form Foreign persons are generally subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources. However, no withholding under section 1441 or 1442 is required on income that is, or is deemed to be, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and is includible in the beneficial owner\\'s gross income for the tax year.  This withholding exemption does not apply to personal services income and income subject to withholding under section 1445 (dispositions of U.S. real property interests) or section 1446 (foreign partner\\'s share of effectively connected income). Income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States is not a withholdable payment under chapter 4 and thus is not subject to withholding under sections 1471 or 1472. If you receive effectively connected income from sources in the United States, you must provide Form W-8ECI to:   Establish that you are not a U.S. person, Claim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8ECI is being provided or are an entity engaged in a U.S. trade or business submitting Form W-8ECI on behalf of your owners, partners, or beneficiaries, and Claim that the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.    If you expect to receive both income that is effectively connected and income that is not effectively connected from a withholding agent, you must provide Form W-8ECI for the effectively connected income and Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8EXP, or Form W-8IMY (as appropriate) for income that is not effectively connected. If you submit Form W-8ECI to a partnership, the income claimed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business is subject to withholding under section 1446. If a nominee holds an interest in a partnership on your behalf, you, not the nominee, must submit the form to the partnership or nominee that is the withholding agent. If you are a foreign partnership, a foreign simple trust, or a foreign grantor trust with effectively connected income, you can submit Form W-8ECI without attaching Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, or other documentation for your foreign partners, beneficiaries, or owners. A withholding agent or payer of the income can rely on a properly completed Form W-8ECI to treat the payment associated with the Form W-8ECI as a payment to a foreign person who beneficially owns the amounts paid and is either entitled to an exemption from withholding under sections 1441, 1442, 1471, or 1472 because the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States or subject to withholding under section 1446. Provide Form W-8ECI to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid, credited, or allocated to you. Failure by a beneficial owner to provide a Form W-8ECI when requested may lead to withholding at the 30% rate or the backup withholding rate under section 3406.   Additional information.  For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E,  W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.       Who Must Provide Form W-8ECI You must give Form W-8ECI to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign person and you are the beneficial owner of U.S. source income that is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or are an entity (including a foreign partnership or foreign trust) engaged in a U.S. trade or business submitting this form on behalf of your owners, partners, or beneficiaries. Do not use Form W-8ECI if:   You are a nonresident alien individual who claims exemption from withholding on compensation for independent or certain dependent personal services performed in the United States. Instead, provide Form 8233 or Form W-4. You are the beneficial owner of a payment subject to withholding and are claiming an exemption from withholding for a reason other than a claim that the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. For example, if you are a foreign person who is the beneficial owner of U.S. source income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and you are claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty in effect, do not use Form W-8ECI. Instead, provide Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E. You are a foreign person receiving proceeds from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest. Instead, see Form 8288-B. You are filing for a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Instead, provide Form W-8EXP. However, you should use Form W-8BEN-E if you are claiming treaty benefits or are providing the form only to claim exempt recipient status for backup withholding purposes. You should use Form W-8ECI, however, if you received effectively connected income (for example, income from commercial activities).  You are acting as an intermediary (acting not for your own account or for that of your partners, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian) or qualified intermediary with respect to a payment subject to withholding. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. You are a foreign partnership or foreign trust acting in your capacity as a withholding foreign partnership or a withholding foreign trust for purposes of sections 1441, 1442, and 1471 through 1474.  A withholding foreign partnership is, generally, a foreign partnership that has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS under which it agrees to assume primary withholding responsibility for each partner\\'s distributive share of income subject to withholding that is paid to the partnership. A withholding foreign trust is, generally, a foreign simple trust or a foreign grantor trust that has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS under which it agrees to assume primary withholding responsibility for each beneficiary\\'s or owner\\'s distributive share of income subject to withholding that is paid to the trust. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. You are a foreign corporation that is a personal holding company receiving compensation described in section 543(a)(7). Such compensation is not exempt from withholding as effectively connected income but can be exempt from withholding on another basis. You are a foreign partner in a partnership and the income allocated to you from the partnership is effectively connected with the conduct of the partnership\\'s trade or business in the United States. Instead, provide Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable). However, if you made or will make an election under section 871(d) or 882(d), provide Form W-8ECI. In addition, if you are otherwise engaged in a trade or business in the United States and you want your allocable share of income from the partnership to be subject to withholding under section 1446, provide Form W-8ECI.     Giving Form W-8ECI to the withholding agent.  Do not send Form W-8ECI to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. Give Form W-8ECI to the person requesting it before the payment is made, credited, or allocated. If you do not provide Form W-8ECI, the withholding agent can have to withhold at the 30% rate or the backup withholding rate. A separate Form W-8ECI generally must be given to each withholding agent.    U.S. branch of foreign bank or insurance company.  A payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or a foreign insurance company that is subject to U.S. regulation by the Federal Reserve Board or state insurance authorities is presumed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States if the withholding agent has an EIN provided by the branch. The presumption does not apply if the branch provides a withholding agent with a Form W-8BEN-E for the income.     Expiration of Form W-8ECI.  Generally, a Form W-8ECI will remain valid for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year, unless a change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8ECI signed on September 30, 2017, generally remains valid through December 31, 2020.     Change in circumstances.  If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8ECI you have submitted incorrect, you must notify the withholding agent or payer within 30 days of the change in circumstances and you must file a new Form W-8ECI or other appropriate form. For example, if during the tax year any part or all of the income is no longer effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, your Form W-8ECI is no longer valid. You must notify the withholding agent and provide Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY. See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for the definition of a change in circumstances for purposes of chapter 3, and Regulations section 1.1471-(c)(6)(ii)(E) for purposes of chapter 4.       Definitions  Beneficial owner.  For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the income in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income. Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent. The beneficial owners of a foreign grantor trust (a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. Generally, these beneficial owner rules apply for purposes of sections 1441, 1442, and 1446, except that section 1446 requires a foreign simple trust to provide a Form W-8 on its own behalf rather than on behalf of the beneficiary of such trust. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself. A payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. However, for purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9. Instead, the grantor or other owner must provide Form W-8 or Form W-9 as appropriate.    Chapter 3.  Chapter 3 means chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.    Chapter 4.  Chapter 4 means chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.    Disregarded entity.  A business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. A disregarded entity does not submit Form W-8ECI to a partnership for purposes of section 1446. Instead, the owner of such entity provides the appropriate documentation. See Regulations section 1.1446-1.    Effectively connected income.  Generally, when a foreign person engages in a trade or business in the United States, all income from sources in the United States other than fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income (for example, interest, dividends, rents, and certain similar amounts) is considered income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. FDAP income may or may not be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Factors to be considered to determine whether FDAP income and similar amounts from U.S. sources are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business include whether:   The income is from assets used in, or held for use in, the conduct of that trade or business, or The activities of that trade or business were a material factor in the realization of the income.    There are special rules for determining whether income from securities is effectively connected with the active conduct of a U.S. banking, financing, or similar business. See section 864(c)(4)(B)(ii) and Regulations section 1.864-4(c)(5)(ii) for more information. Effectively connected income, after allowable deductions, is taxed at graduated rates applicable to U.S. persons and resident aliens, rather than at the 30% rate. You must report this income on your annual U.S. income tax or information return.  A partnership that has effectively connected income allocable to foreign partners is generally required to withhold tax under section 1446. The withholding tax rate on a partner\\'s share of effectively connected income is 35% for corporate partners and 39.6% for all other taxable partners. In certain circumstances the partnership can withhold tax at the highest applicable rate to a particular type of income (for example, long-term capital gain allocated to a noncorporate partner). Any amount withheld under section 1446 on your behalf, and reflected on Form 8805 issued by the partnership to you, can be credited on your U.S. income tax return.    Foreign person.  A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other person that’s not a U.S. person.    Nonresident alien individual.  Any individual who is not a citizen or resident alien of the United States is a nonresident alien individual. An alien individual meeting either the \"green card test\" or the \"substantial presence test\" for the calendar year is a resident alien. Any person not meeting either test is a nonresident alien individual. Additionally, an alien individual who is treated as a nonresident alien pursuant to Regulations section 301.7701(b)-7 for purposes of computing the individual\\'s U.S. tax liability, or an alien individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or American Samoa is a nonresident alien individual.  See Pub. 519 for more information on resident and nonresident alien status including information about the \"green card test\" and \"substantial presence test.\"                 Even though a nonresident alien individual married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien can choose to be treated as a resident alien for certain purposes (for example, filing a joint income tax return), such individual is still treated as a nonresident alien for withholding tax purposes on all income except wages.    Withholding agent.  Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 withholding is a withholding agent. For purposes of chapter 4, any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of a withholdable payment is a withholding agent. The withholding agent can be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches treated as U.S. person.  Generally, the person who pays (or causes to be paid) an amount subject to withholding to the foreign person (or to its agent) must withhold. For purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent can be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.    Withholdable payment.  A withholdable payment means any payment of U.S. source FDAP income, subject to certain exemptions described in Regulations sections 1.1471-2(b) and 1.1473-1(a). However, no exceptions to withholding on U.S. source FDAP income for purposes other than chapter 4 apply when determining whether a payment is a withholdable payment. For example, an exclusion from an amount subject to withholding under Regulations section 1.1441-2(a) does not apply for purposes of determining whether a payment constitutes a withholdable payment. Under chapter 4, a payment of effectively connected income is not a withholdable payment.    U.S. person.  A U.S. person is defined in section 7701(a)(30) and includes an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, as well as domestic partnerships, corporations, trusts, and estates.      Specific Instructions    Part I  Line 1.  Enter your name. If you are providing this form for a disregarded entity with a single owner who is a foreign person, this form should be completed and signed by the foreign single owner. If the account to which a payment is made or credited is in the name of the disregarded entity, the foreign single owner can inform the withholding agent of this fact by including the name of the disregarded entity on line 3 of Part I of the form.    If you own the income or account jointly with one or more other persons, the income or account will be treated by the withholding agent as owned by a foreign person if Forms W-8ECI are provided by all of the owners. If the withholding agent receives a Form W-9 from any of the joint owners the payment must be treated as made to a U.S. person.    Line 2.  If you are providing this form for a corporation, enter the country of incorporation. If you are filing for another type of entity, enter the country under whose laws the entity is created, organized, or governed. If you are an individual, provide your country of residence for tax purposes.     Line 3.  If you are providing this form for a disregarded entity, enter the name of the disregarded entity receiving the payment. This line is not required but can assist the withholding agent that is making a payment to you. The withholding agent can request additional referencing information (such as your account number) which should be entered on line 9. When completing this form, do not provide information concerning the disregarded entity on any line other than this line 3 or line 9. Instead, you should complete the form using the information of the owner of the disregarded entity.    Line 4.  Check the box that applies. By checking a box, you are representing that you qualify for this classification. You must check the one box that represents your classification (for example, corporation, partnership, etc.) under U.S. tax principles. If more than one classification applies to you, select the most specific status available. For example, if you are a private foundation, you are also considered a tax-exempt organization, and you should check the box for private foundation rather than the box for tax-exempt organization.    Line 5.  Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for that country\\'s income tax. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless such address is the registered address of an entity identified on line 1 which does not have another address in the jurisdiction. If you are an individual who does not have a tax residence in any country, your permanent residence is where you normally reside. If you are not an individual and you do not have a tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is where you maintain your principal office.    Line 6.  Enter your business address in the United States. Do not show a post office box.    Line 7.  Enter your  U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN). A U.S.TIN is a social security number (SSN), employer identification number (EIN), or IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Check the appropriate box for the type of U.S. TIN you are providing. You are required to provide a TIN for this form to be valid. If you are an individual, you are generally required to enter your SSN. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5 from a Social Security Administration (SSA) office or online at www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf. If in the United States, you can call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213. Fill in Form SS-5 and return it to the SSA. If you do not have an SSN and are not eligible to get one, you must get an ITIN. To apply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 with the IRS. It usually takes 4-6 weeks to get an ITIN. If you are not an individual (for example, if you are a foreign estate or trust), or you are an individual who is an employer or who is engaged in a U.S. trade or business as a sole proprietor, use Form SS-4 to obtain an EIN. If you are a disregarded entity, enter the U.S. TIN of your foreign single owner.    You can also apply for an EIN online. For more information, visit IRS.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online.    Line 8.  If you are providing this Form W-8ECI to document yourself as an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on a Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the tax identifying number (TIN) issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence identified on line 5 unless:  You have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs), or  You properly identified yourself as a government, central bank of issue, or international organization on line 4.     If you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 8 and you are not a government, central bank of issue, or international organization, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN.  For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence.  The explanation may be written on line 8, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form.  If you are writing the explanation on line 8, you can shorten it to \"not legally required.\"  Do not write \"not applicable.\"    Line 9.  You or the withholding agent requesting this form can use this line to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its obligations. For example, you can use line 9 to include the name and number of the account for which you are providing the form.    Line 10.  If you are providing this Form W-8ECI to document yourself as an account holder with respect to a financial account (as described in line 8 above) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI), provide your date of birth if you are an individual.  Use the following format to input your information: MM-DD-YYYY.  For example, if you were born on April 15, 1975, you would enter 04-15-1975.    Line 11.  You must specify the items of income that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. You will generally have to provide Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8EXP, or Form W-8IMY for those items from U.S. sources that are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.  If you are providing this form to a partnership because you are a partner and have made an election under section 871(d) or section 882(d), attach a copy of the election to the form. If you have not made the election, but intend to do so effective for the current tax year, attach a statement to the form indicating your intent. See Regulations section 1.871-10(d)(3).        Part II  Signature.  Form W-8ECI must be signed and dated by the beneficial owner of the income, or, if the beneficial owner is not an individual, by an authorized representative or officer of the beneficial owner. If an authorized representative or agent is completing Form W-8ECI on behalf of the beneficial owner of the income, the representative or agent must check the box to certify that he or she has the legal capacity to sign for the person identified on line 1. If Form W-8ECI is completed by an agent acting under a duly authorized power of attorney for the beneficial owner, the form must be accompanied by the power of attorney in proper form or a copy thereof specifically authorizing the agent to represent the principal in making, executing, and presenting the form. This requirement does not apply to a partnership or other flow-through entity submitting this form with respect to a payment of effectively connected income that is beneficially owned by the entity’s partners or owners. Form 2848 can be used for this purpose. The agent, as well as the beneficial owner, can incur liability for the penalties provided for an erroneous, false, or fraudulent form. A withholding agent can allow you to provide this form with an electronic signature.  The electronic signature must indicate that the form was electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and statement that the form has been electronically signed).  Simply typing your name into the signature line is not an electronic signature.    If any information on Form W-8ECI becomes incorrect, you must submit a correct new form within 30 days to the requester of this form unless you will not receive a future payment from the withholding agent that would require an updated Form W-8.

       " '   Instructions for Form W-8EXP (07/2017) Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 07/2017     General Instructions  Future developments.  For the latest information about developments related to Form W-8EXP and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/FormW8EXP.      What’s New These instructions have been updated to reflect temporary and final regulations under chapters 3 and 4 published in January 2017. These instructions include additional information on when a foreign TIN is required to be included on Form W-8EXP. In addition, these instructions include information about the use of electronic signatures.     Purpose of Form Under chapter 3, foreign persons are subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of interest (including certain original issue discount (OID)), dividends, rents, premiums, annuities, compensation for, or in expectation of, services performed, or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income. This tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441 or 1442 on that amount. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person for the benefit of the beneficial owner. Foreign persons are also subject to tax at graduated rates on income they earn that is considered effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person invests in a partnership that conducts a U.S. trade or business, the foreign person is considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The partnership is required to withhold tax under section 1446 on the foreign person’s distributive share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. If you receive certain types of income, you must provide Form W-8EXP to:   Establish that you are not a U.S. person; Claim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8EXP is given; and Claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding as a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession.    In general, payments to a foreign government (including a foreign central bank of issue wholly-owned by a foreign sovereign) from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, other domestic securities, financial instruments held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy, and interest on deposits in banks in the United States are exempt from tax under section 892 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Payments other than those described above, including income derived in the U.S. from the conduct of a commercial activity, income received from a controlled commercial entity (including gain from the disposition of any interest in a controlled commercial entity), and income received by a controlled commercial entity, do not qualify for exemption from tax under section 892 or exemption from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. See Temporary Regulations section 1.892-3T. In addition, certain distributions to a foreign government from a real estate investment trust (REIT) may not be eligible for relief from withholding and may be subject to withholding at 35% of the gain realized. For the definition of \"commercial activities,\" see Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T. Amounts allocable to a foreign person from a partnership’s trade or business in the United States are considered derived from a commercial activity in the United States. The partnership\\'s net effectively connected taxable income is subject to withholding under section 1446. In general, payments to an international organization from investment in the United States in stocks, bonds and other domestic securities, interest on deposits in banks in the United States, and payments from any other source within the United States are exempt from tax under section 892 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. See Temporary Regulations section 1.892-6T. Payments to a foreign central bank of issue (whether or not wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) or to the Bank for International Settlements from obligations of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or from interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business, are also generally exempt from tax under section 895 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. In addition, payments to a foreign central bank of issue from bankers’ acceptances are exempt from tax under section 871(i)(2)(C) and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Effectively connected income or gain from a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States may be subject to withholding under section 1446. Payments to a foreign tax-exempt organization of certain types of U.S. source income are also generally exempt from tax and exempt from withholding. Gross investment income of a foreign private foundation, however, is subject to withholding under section 1443(b) at a rate of 4%. Effectively connected income or gain from a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States may be subject to withholding under section 1446. Payments to a government of a possession of the United States are generally exempt from tax and withholding under section 115(2). To establish eligibility for exemption from 30% tax and withholding for chapter 3 purposes under sections 892, 895, 501(c), or 115(2), a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession must provide a Form W-8EXP to a withholding agent or payer with all necessary documentation. The withholding agent or payer of the income may rely on a properly completed Form W-8EXP to treat the payment, credit, or allocation associated with the Form W-8EXP as being made to a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession exempt from withholding at the 30% rate (or, where appropriate, subject to withholding at a 4% rate). Provide Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid, credited, or allocated to you. Failure by a beneficial owner to provide a Form W-8EXP when requested may lead to withholding at the 30% rate, the backup withholding rate, or the rate applicable under section 1446. In addition to the requirements of chapter 3, chapter 4 requires withholding agents to identify chapter 4 status of payees receiving withholdable payments to determine whether withholding applies under chapter 4. Under chapter 4, certain foreign governments, foreign central banks, international organizations, and foreign entities described in section 501(c) (other than an insurance company described in section 501(c)(15)) are not subject to withholding under chapter 4. A withholding agent may request this Form W-8EXP to establish your chapter 4 status and avoid withholding. Chapter 4 also requires participating FFIs and certain registered deemed-compliant FFIs to document entity account holders in order to determine their chapter 4 status regardless of whether withholding applies to any payments made to the entities. If you maintain an account with an FFI and have a chapter 4 status shown in Part I, line 4 of this form, provide this Form W-8EXP when requested by the FFI in order to document your chapter 4 status.  Additional information.  For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.    Who must provide Form W-8EXP.  You must give Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession receiving a withholdable payment or receiving a payment subject to chapter 3 withholding, or are such an entity maintaining an account with an FFI requesting this form.  Do not use Form W-8EXP if:   You are not a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession receiving amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E, or Form W-8ECI. For example, if you are a foreign tax-exempt organization claiming a benefit under an income tax treaty, provide Form W-8BEN-E. You are receiving withholdable payments from a withholding agent requesting this form and you do not have a chapter 4 status identified in Part I, line 4 of this form. You are acting as an intermediary (that is, acting not for your own account, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian). Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. You are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI. You are a tax-exempt organization receiving unrelated business taxable income subject to withholding under section 1443(a). Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8ECI (as applicable) for this portion of your income.  You are a foreign partnership, a foreign simple trust, or a foreign grantor trust. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY. However, a foreign grantor trust is required to provide documentation of its grantor or other owner for purposes of section 1446. See Regulations section 1.1446-1.       Giving Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent.  Do not send Form W-8EXP to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this person will be the one from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. Generally, a separate Form W-8EXP must be given to each withholding agent.  Give Form W-8EXP to the person requesting it before the payment is made, credited, or allocated to you or your account. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold tax at the chapter 3 or chapter 4 30% rate, the backup withholding rate (determined under section 3406), or the rate applicable under section 1446. If you receive more than one type of income from a single withholding agent, the withholding agent may require you to submit a Form W-8EXP for each different type of income.    Expiration of Form W-8EXP.  Generally, a Form W-8EXP remains in effect indefinitely until a change of circumstances makes any information provided on the form incorrect. In some cases, however, Form W-8EXP will remain valid only for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year. For example, a Form W-8EXP provided on February 15, 2015, by a controlled entity of a foreign government would be subject to the three-year validity period and thus would expire on December 31, 2018, for chapter 3 purposes. For more exceptions to the indefinite validity period, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii) for chapter 3 purposes and Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii) for chapter 4 purposes.    Change in circumstances.  If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8EXP you have submitted incorrect, you must notify the withholding agent within 30 days of the change in circumstances and you must file a new Form W-8EXP or other appropriate form.       Definitions  Amounts exempt from tax under section 895.  Section 895 generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income a foreign central bank of issue receives from obligations of the United States (or of any agency or instrumentality thereof) or from interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business unless such obligations or deposits are held for, or used in connection with, the conduct of commercial banking functions or other commercial activities of the foreign central bank of issue.    Amounts exempt from tax under section 892.  Only a foreign government or an international organization as defined below qualifies for exemption from taxation under section 892. Section 892 generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income a foreign government receives from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, or other domestic securities; financial instruments held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy; and interest on deposits in banks in the United States of monies belonging to the foreign government. Income of a foreign government from any of the following sources is not exempt from U.S. taxation.   The conduct of any commercial activity. A controlled commercial entity. The disposition of any interest in a controlled commercial entity. For the definition of \"commercial activity,\" see Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T.    Section 892 also generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income of an international organization received from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, or other domestic securities and interest on deposits in banks in the United States of monies belonging to the international organization or from any other source within the United States.    Amounts subject to withholding.  Generally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID). For purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. Generally, an amount subject to chapter 4 withholding is an amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a) to which an exception does not apply under chapter 4. The exemptions from withholding or taxation provided for under chapter 3 are not applicable when determining whether withholding applies under chapter 4. For exceptions applicable to the definition of a withholdable payment, see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) (exempting, for example, certain nonfinancial payments).    Beneficial owner.  For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income. Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself. These beneficial owner rules apply primarily for purposes of withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. The rules also generally apply for purposes of section 1446, with a few exceptions. See Regulations section 1.1446-1 for instances where the documentation requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 differ from section 1446.    Chapter 3.  Chapter 3 means Chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.    Chapter 4.  Chapter 4 means Chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.    Commercial activities.  For purposes of chapter 4, commercial activities are financial activities of a type engaged in by an insurance company, custodial institution, or depository institution (including the act of accepting deposits). An exempt beneficial owner will not be considered exempt for chapter 4 purposes with respect to payments derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity. See Regulations section 1.1471-6(h), including limitations on the scope of a commercial financial activity. For purposes of chapter 3, commercial activities are described in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T.    Controlled commercial entity.  A controlled commercial entity is an entity engaged in commercial activities described in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T (whether within or outside the United States) if the foreign government holds:  Any interest in the entity that is 50% or more of the total of all interests in the entity, or A sufficient interest or any other interest in the entity which provides the foreign government with effective practical control of the entity.    An entity includes a corporation, a partnership, a trust (including a pension trust), and an estate. A partnership’s commercial activities are attributable to its general and limited partners for purposes of determining whether the partner is a controlled commercial entity for purposes of section 892. The partnership’s activities will result in the partnership having to withhold tax under section 1446 on commercial income that is the effectively connected taxable income allocable to a foreign government partner.   Note. A foreign central bank of issue will be treated as a controlled commercial entity only if it engages in commercial activities within the United States.       Chapter 4 status.  The term chapter 4 status means a person’s status as a U.S. person, specified U.S. person, foreign individual, participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, restricted distributor, exempt beneficial owner, nonparticipating FFI, territory financial institution, excepted nonfinancial foreign entity (NFFE), or passive NFFE. See Regulations section 1.1471-1(b) for the definitions of these terms.    Deemed-compliant FFI.  Under section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN). These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f).    Exempt beneficial owner.  An exempt beneficial owner means a person that is described in Regulations section 1.1471-6 and includes a foreign government, a political subdivision of a foreign government, a wholly owned instrumentality or agency of a foreign government or governments, an international organization, a wholly owned agency or instrumentality of an international organization, a foreign central bank of issue, a government of a U.S. possession, certain retirement funds, and certain entities wholly owned by one or more exempt beneficial owners.

A financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(e).    Foreign central bank of issue.  A foreign central bank of issue is a bank that is by law or government sanction the principal authority, other than the government itself, to issue instruments intended to circulate as currency. Such a bank is generally the custodian of the banking reserves of the country under whose law it is organized. The Bank of International Settlements is treated as though it were a foreign central bank of issue. A foreign central bank of issue must provide Form W-8EXP to establish eligibility for exemption from withholding for payments exempt from tax under either section 892 or section 895.    Foreign financial institution (FFI).  A foreign financial institution (FFI) generally means a foreign entity that is a financial institution.    Foreign person.  A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, foreign estate, foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign person.    Foreign government.  For chapter 3 purposes, a foreign government includes only the integral parts or controlled entities of a foreign sovereign as defined in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-2T. Similar definitions apply for chapter 4 purposes under Regulations section 1.1471-6(b). An integral part of a foreign sovereign, in general, is any person, body of persons, organization, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of a foreign country. The net earnings of the governing authority must be credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion benefiting any private person. A controlled entity of a foreign sovereign is an entity that is separate in form from the foreign sovereign or otherwise constitutes a separate juridical entity only if:   It is wholly owned and controlled by the foreign sovereign directly or indirectly through one or more controlled entities. It is organized under the laws of the foreign sovereign by which it is owned. Its net earnings are credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion of its income benefiting any private person. Its assets vest in the foreign sovereign upon dissolution.    A controlled entity of a foreign sovereign also includes a pension trust defined in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-2T(c) and may include a foreign central bank of issue to the extent that it is wholly owned by a foreign sovereign. A foreign government must provide Form W-8EXP to establish eligibility for exemption from withholding for payments exempt from tax under section 892 or for purposes of establishing its status as an exempt beneficial owner.    Intergovernmental agreement (IGA).  An IGA means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, see the list of jurisdictions at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx. A Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency thereof, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI. A Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the U.S. or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency thereof and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that has entered into an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is a participating FFI, but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI.    International organization.  For purposes of chapter 3, an international organization is any public international organization entitled to enjoy privileges, exemptions, and immunities as an international organization under the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288-288(f)). In general, to qualify as an international organization, the United States must participate in the organization pursuant to a treaty or under the authority of an Act of Congress authorizing such participation. Any organization that qualifies as an international organization under chapter 3 also qualifies as an international organization under chapter 4.  For purposes of chapter 4, an international organization also includes any intergovernmental or supranational organization that is comprised primarily of foreign governments, that is recognized as an intergovernmental or supranational organization under a foreign law similar to 22 U.S.C. 288-288(f) or that has in effect a headquarters agreement with a foreign government, and whose income does not inure to the benefit of private persons.    Participating FFI.  A participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term participating FFI also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution, unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI.    Specified U.S. person.  A specified U.S. person is any U.S. person other than a person identified in Regulations section 1.1473-1(c).    Substantial U.S. owner.

Territory financial institution.  The term territory financial institution means a financial institution that is incorporated or organized under the laws of any U.S. territory. However, an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company is not a territory financial institution.    Withholdable payment.  The term withholdable payment means an amount subject to withholding for purposes of chapter 4 as described in Amounts subject to withholding, earlier. Also see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a) for the definition of withholdable payment.    Withholding agent.  Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or 4 withholding is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies.      Specific Instructions    Part I — Identification of Beneficial Owner Before completing Part I, complete the Worksheet for Foreign Governments, International Organizations, and Foreign Central Banks of Issue, later, to determine whether amounts received are or will be exempt from U.S. tax under section 892 or 895 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Use the results of this worksheet to check the appropriate box on line 3 and in Part II. Do not give the worksheet to the withholding agent. Instead, keep it for your records.  Line 1.  Enter the full name of the organization.    Line 2.  Enter the country under the laws of which the foreign government or other foreign organization was created, incorporated, organized, or governed.    Line 3.  Check the one box that applies. A foreign central bank of issue (wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) should check the \"Foreign government\" box. If you are a Foreign private foundation, you should check the \"Foreign private foundation\" box rather than the \"Foreign tax-exempt organization\" box.     Line 4.  Check the one box that applies to your chapter 4 status (if necessary). You are required to provide a chapter 4 status if you are the payee of a withholdable payment or hold an account with an FFI requesting this form. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(a) for the definition of a payee for purposes of chapter 4. By checking a box on this line, you are representing that you qualify for this classification and, if you are claiming a status as an exempt beneficial owner, that you are the beneficial owner of the payments to which this form relates for purposes of chapter 4.      For certain chapter 4 statuses, you are required to complete an additional line on this form certifying that you meet the conditions of the status indicated on line 4 (as defined under Regulations section 1.1471-5 or 1.1471-6 or an applicable IGA). Make sure you complete the required portion of this form before signing and providing it to the withholding agent.    If you do not certify as to your chapter 4 status, this Form W-8EXP will not be valid for purposes of chapter 4 if you receive a withholdable payment at any time in the future. For example, if you do not certify as to your chapter 4 status because the only payments you receive from the withholding agent are with respect to grandfathered obligations described in Regulations section 1.1471-2(b), then you will be required to resubmit Form W-8EXP and certify to your chapter 4 status if you receive a withholdable payment in the future. You may consider certifying to your chapter 4 status even if not required in order to avoid resubmitting Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent. See Expiration of Form W-8EXP, earlier.  Line 5.  The permanent address of a foreign government, international organization, or foreign central bank of issue is where it maintains its principal office. For all other organizations, the permanent address is the address in the country where the organization claims to be a resident for tax purposes. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless such address is the only permanent address you use and it appears as your registered address in your organizational documents.    Line 6.  Enter the mailing address only if it is different from the address shown on line 5.    Line 7.  A U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN) means an employer identification number (EIN). A U.S. TIN is generally required if you are claiming an exemption or reduced rate of withholding based solely on your claim of tax-exempt status under section 501(c) or private foundation status. Use Form SS-4, to obtain an EIN.    Line 8a.  If the organization has registered with the IRS as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), direct reporting NFFE, check the \"GIIN\" box and provide your GIIN. For payments made prior to January 1, 2015, a Form W-8EXP provided by a reporting Model 1 FFI need not contain a GIIN. For payments made prior to January 1, 2016, a sponsored direct reporting NFFE may provide the GIIN of its sponsoring entity.    Line 8b.  If you are providing this Form W-8EXP to document yourself as an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on a Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the TIN issued to you by the jurisdiction in which you are a tax resident identified on line 5 unless:  You have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs), or You properly identified yourself as a foreign government, foreign central bank of issue, international organization, or government of a U.S. possession on line 3.  If you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 8b, and you are not a foreign government, foreign central bank of issue, international organization, or government of a U.S. possession, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. The explanation may be written on line 8b, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If you are writing the explanation on line 8b, you may shorten it to \"not legally required.\" Do not write \"not applicable.\"                 Line 9.  This line may be used by the filer of Form W-8EXP or by the withholding agent to whom it is provided to include any referencing information that is necessary or useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its obligations. For example, a filer may use line 9 to include the name and number of the account for which the filer is providing the form.       Part II — Qualification Statement for Chapter 3 Status    You are not required to complete a chapter 3 qualification statement if you are submitting this form to document your chapter 4 status and are not receiving a payment that is subject to withholding under chapter 3. However, in such a case, you may also provide Form W-8BEN-E to document your chapter 4 status.  Line 10.  All foreign governments claiming the applicability of section 892 must check box 10a as well as box 10b or box 10c, whichever applies. Enter the name of the foreign sovereign’s country on line 10b (if the entity is an integral part of a foreign government) or on line 10c (if the entity is a controlled entity). A central bank of issue (wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) should check box 10c.    Line 11.  Check this box if you are an international organization. By checking this box, you are certifying to all the statements made in line 11.    Line 12.  Check this box if you are a foreign central bank of issue for purposes of chapter 3 (see definitions) not wholly owned by a foreign sovereign.

Check this box if you do not have an IRS determination letter, but are providing an opinion of U.S. counsel concluding that you are an organization described in section 501(c).     Box 13c. If you are a section 501(c)(3) organization, check this box if you are not a private foundation. You must attach to the withholding certificate an affidavit setting forth sufficient facts concerning your operations and support to enable the IRS to determine that you would be likely to qualify as an organization described in section 509(a)(1), (2), (3), or (4). See Rev. Proc. 92-94, 1992-2 C.B. 507, section 4, for information on affidavit preparation of foreign equivalents of domestic public charities.     Box 13d. Check this box if you are a section 501(c)(3) organization and you are a private foundation described in section 509.     Line 14.  Check this box if you are a government of a U.S. possession. By checking this box you are certifying to the statements made in line 14.       Part III — Qualification Statement for Chapter 4 Status    You are not required to complete a chapter 4 qualification statement if you are not the payee of a withholdable payment or are not an accountholder holding an account with an FFI requesting this form.  Line 15.  Check this box to indicate that you are treated as a nonreporting FFI under an applicable IGA (and as defined in the IGA). You must identify the applicable IGA by entering the name of the jurisdiction that has the applicable IGA in effect with the United States. You must also provide the withholding agent with the class of entity described in Annex II of the IGA applicable to your status.

Proc. 2017-15, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB/ar15.html, with respect to the requirements of a QDD. A QDD that receives payments for which the QDD is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty may use its Form W-8IMY to both certify its status as a qualified intermediary (QI) acting as a QDD and to claim treaty benefits with respect to such payments. To make a claim for treaty benefits in such a case, the QDD should provide a withholding agent with a statement associated with its Form W-8IMY that contains the information required in Part III of Form W-8BEN-E.\\n\\n\\nU.S. branch certification.\\nFinal regulations under chapter 4 published in January 2017 changed certain requirements for U.S. branches of foreign entities.

For payments made on or after July 1, 2017, those branches must certify that they are applying the rules described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) in order to avoid being withheld upon under chapter 4. The final regulations also provide that U.S. branches of FFIs that are treated as U.S. persons no longer have to be branches of FFIs with specified chapter 4 statuses. These instructions reflect that change by allowing such branches to leave lines 5 and 9 blank.\\n\\n\\nLimited FFIs and limited branches.\\nLimited FFI and limited branch statuses expired on December 31, 2016, and have been removed from the form and instructions.\\n\\n\\nSponsored FFIs and sponsored direct reporting non-financial foreign entities (sponsored direct reporting NFFEs).\\nAs of January 1, 2017, a sponsored FFI that is a registered deemed-compliant FFI or sponsored direct reporting NFFE is required to obtain its own GIIN to be provided on this form and can no longer provide its sponsoring entity’s GIIN. This form has been updated to reflect this requirement.\\n\\n\\nNonreporting IGA FFIs.\\nThis form and these instructions have been updated to reflect the requirements for withholding agents to document nonreporting IGA FFIs in the Treasury regulations. These instructions also clarify that nonreporting IGA FFIs that are sponsored entities should provide their own GIIN (if required) and should not provide the GIIN of the sponsoring entity. See the instructions to Part XIX. In addition, these instructions provide that a trustee of a trustee-documented trust that is a foreign person should provide the GIIN it received when it registered as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or reporting Model 1 FFI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPurpose of Form\\nUnder chapter 3, foreign persons are generally subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of interest (including certain original issue discount (OID)), dividends, rents, premiums, annuities, compensation for, or in expectation of, services performed, or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) gains, profits, or income. This tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441 or 1442 on that amount. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person, such as an intermediary, agent, trustee, executor, or partnership, for the benefit of the beneficial owner.\\nUnder chapter 4, withholding agents must withhold at a 30% rate under sections 1471 and 1472 on withholdable payments made to nonparticipating FFIs (including when the nonparticipating FFI is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary), certain other foreign entities, and certain account holders of FFIs. For example, if a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment of portfolio interest described in section 871(h) to an account maintained by a nonparticipating FFI, the payment will be subject to a 30% withholding tax under section 1471 even if the nonparticipating FFI is an intermediary or flow-through entity and the beneficial owner for whom the intermediary or flow-through is acting is a foreign individual who provides a valid Form W-8BEN.\\nForeign persons are also subject to tax at graduated rates on income they earn that is considered effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person invests in a partnership that conducts a U.S. trade or business, the foreign person is considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The partnership is required to withhold tax under section 1446 on the foreign person’s distributive share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. The partnership may generally accept any form submitted for purposes of section 1441 or 1442, with few exceptions, to establish the foreign status of the partner. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6 to determine whether the form submitted for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will be accepted for purposes of section 1446.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor purposes of section 1446, Form W-8IMY may only be submitted by an upper-tier foreign partnership or a foreign grantor trust, both of which must furnish additional documentation for their owners.\\n\\nAdditional information.\\nFor additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho Must Provide Form W-8IMY\\nExcept as otherwise provided, you should provide Form W-8IMY when receiving a reportable amount or withholdable payment on behalf of another person or as a flow-through entity. When receiving a withholdable payment, your chapter 4 status is generally required to be included on the form unless otherwise provided in accordance with these instructions. Form W-8IMY must be provided by the following persons.\\n\\n\\n\\nA foreign person, or a foreign branch of a U.S. person, to establish that it is a QI that is not acting for its own account, to represent that it has provided or will provide a withholding statement, as required, or, if applicable, to represent that it has assumed primary withholding responsibility under chapters 3 and 4 of the Code (excluding section 1446) and/or primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility.\\n\\n\\nA foreign person, or a foreign branch of a U.S. person, to establish that it is a QI acting as a QDD or assuming primary withholding responsibility with respect to payments of substitute interest, as permitted by the QI agreement. A foreign person should also provide a Form W-8IMY to establish that it is a qualified intermediary that has a foreign branch that is acting as a QDD. A QDD that receives payments for which the QDD is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty may use its Form W-8IMY to both certify to its status as a QI acting as a QDD and to claim treaty benefits with respect to such payments.\\n\\n\\nA foreign person to establish that it is a nonqualified intermediary that is not acting for its own account, to certify its chapter 4 status (if required), to certify whether it reports U.S. accounts under chapter 4 (if required), and to indicate, if applicable, that it is using the form to transmit withholding certificates and/or other documentary evidence and has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required.\\n\\n\\nA U.S. branch that is acting as an intermediary to represent that the income it receives is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and either that it is using the form (1) to evidence it is treated as a U.S. person under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) with respect to any payments associated with the Form W-8IMY, or (2) to transmit the documentation of the persons for whom it receives a payment and has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required, and to certify it is applying the rules described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) when receiving a withholdable payment.\\n\\n\\nA financial institution incorporated or organized under the laws of a U.S. territory that is acting as an intermediary or is a flow-through entity to represent that it is a financial institution (other than an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company) and either that it is using the form (1) to evidence it is treated as a U.S. person under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) with respect to any payments associated with the Form W-8IMY, or (2) to certify that it is transmitting documentation of the persons for whom it receives a payment and has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required.\\n\\n\\nA foreign partnership or a foreign simple or grantor trust to establish that it is a withholding foreign partnership or withholding foreign trust.\\n\\n\\nA foreign partnership or a foreign simple or grantor trust to establish that it is a nonwithholding foreign partnership or nonwithholding foreign simple or grantor trust to certify to its chapter 4 status (if required), to represent that the income is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and to certify that the form is being used to transmit withholding certificates and/or documentary evidence and that it has provided or will provide a withholding statement as required.\\n\\n\\nA foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust to establish that it is an upper-tier foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust for purposes of section 1446 and to represent that the form is being used to transmit withholding certificates and/or documentary evidence and that it has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required.\\n\\n\\nA flow-through entity (including a foreign reverse hybrid entity) transmitting withholding certificates and/or other documentary evidence to claim treaty benefits on behalf of its owners, to certify its chapter 4 status (if required), and to certify that it has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required.\\n\\n\\nA nonparticipating FFI acting as an intermediary or that is a flow-through entity using this form to transmit a withholding statement and withholding certificates or other documentation for exempt beneficial owners described in Regulations section 1.1471-6.\\n\\n\\nPrior to January 1, 2018, a qualified securities lender (QSL) certifying to a withholding agent that it is acting as a QSL with respect to U.S. source substitute dividends received from the withholding agent pursuant to a securities lending transaction (as described in Notice 2010-46).\\n\\n\\nA foreign intermediary or flow-through entity not receiving withholdable payments or reportable amounts that is holding an account with a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI providing this form for purposes of documenting its chapter 4 status as an account holder. No withholding statement is required to be provided along with Form W-8IMY in this case. The entity may instead provide Form W-8BEN-E to document its chapter 4 status as an account holder of an FFI when it is not receiving withholdable payments or reportable amounts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThis form may serve to establish foreign status for purposes of sections 1441, 1442, and 1446. However, any representations that items of income, gain, deduction, or loss are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business will be disregarded by a partnership receiving this form for purposes of section 1446 as the partnership will undertake its own analysis.\\nDo not use Form W-8IMY if you are described below.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are the beneficial owner (other than a QDD acting in its QDD capacity) of U.S. source income (other than income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States), and you need to establish that you are not a U.S. person, establish your chapter 4 status (if required), or claim a reduced rate of withholding on your own behalf under an income tax treaty (if applicable). Instead, submit Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E.\\n\\n\\nYou are a hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits on your own behalf (unless you are a QDD acting in your QDD capacity). Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E to claim treaty benefits. However, if you are receiving a withholdable payment you may also be required to provide Form W-8IMY to establish your chapter 4 status (unless you are a disregarded entity) and the chapter 4 status of each of your partners, beneficiaries, or owners. See the instructions for Form W-8BEN-E for more information about hybrid entities claiming treaty benefits.\\n\\n\\nYou are a foreign reverse hybrid entity (unless you are a QDD acting in your QDD capacity) that is not claiming treaty benefits on behalf of your interest holders. Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E on your own behalf.\\n\\n\\nYou are the beneficial owner of income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI.\\n\\n\\nYou are a nonresident alien individual who claims exemption from withholding on compensation for independent or certain dependent personal services performed in the United States. Instead, provide Form 8233 or Form W-4.\\n\\n\\nYou are a disregarded entity, other than a hybrid entity that is a disregarded entity claiming treaty benefits on your own behalf (see above bullet). Instead, the single owner (if a foreign person) should provide the appropriate Form W-8 based on the single owner\\'s status. If you are a disregarded entity that is a QDD acting in your QDD capacity, your single owner (whether or not a QDD) should provide Form W-8IMY if it is a QI.\\n\\n\\nYou are a QI that has QDD status but are receiving payments of U.S. source income that you beneficially own that are not payments in respect to potential section 871(m) transactions or underlying securities (that is, you are receiving payments that you beneficially own that are not covered by your QI agreement). Instead, provide the appropriate Form W-8 based on your status for those payments you beneficially own.\\n\\n\\nYou are a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b), and, if required, claiming an exemption from chapter 4 withholding. Instead, provide Form W-8EXP. However, these entities should use Form W-8BEN-E instead if they are claiming treaty benefits or are providing the form only to claim exempt recipient status for Form 1099 and backup withholding purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nGiving Form W-8IMY to the withholding agent.\\nDo not send Form W-8IMY to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, the person who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. If you are an account holder of an FFI, the FFI may request this form from you to document the status of your account for chapter 4 purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou may provide a single Form W-8IMY if you have multiple branches receiving payments from the same withholding agent rather than separate Forms W-8IMY to identify each branch receiving payments associated with the form. In such a case, you should provide a schedule that includes all required information for each branch. See the instructions for Part II.\\n\\nWhen to provide Form W-8IMY to the withholding agent.\\nGive Form W-8IMY to the person requesting it before income is paid, credited, or allocated to your account. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold at the 30% rate (for an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3 or a withholdable payment under chapter 4), backup withhold, or withhold at the applicable rate for net effectively connected taxable income allocable to a foreign partner in a partnership under section 1446. Generally, a separate Form W-8IMY must be submitted to each withholding agent from whom you receive a payment. \\n\\n\\nExpiration of Form W-8IMY.\\nGenerally, a Form W-8IMY remains valid until the status of the person whose name is on the certificate is changed in a way relevant to the certificate or there is a change in circumstances that makes the information on the certificate no longer correct. The indefinite validity period does not extend, however, to any other withholding certificates, documentary evidence, or withholding statements associated with the certificate. If you are a QDD, the attachment associated with your Form W-8IMY used to claim treaty benefits (if applicable) is treated as a beneficial owner withholding certificate that is not valid indefinitely.\\n\\n\\nChange in circumstances.\\nIf a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8IMY (or any documentation or withholding statement associated with the Form W-8IMY) you have submitted incorrect for purposes of chapter 3 or chapter 4 (when relevant), you must notify the withholding agent within 30 days of the change in circumstances and provide the documentation required in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E)(2). You must update the information associated with Form W-8IMY as often as is necessary to enable the withholding agent to withhold at the appropriate rate on each payment and to report such income. \\nSee Regulations sections 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for the definition of a change in circumstances for purposes of chapter 3 and Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E) for the definition of a change in circumstances for purposes of chapter 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith respect to an FFI claiming a chapter 4 status under an applicable IGA, a change in circumstances includes when the jurisdiction where the FFI is organized or resident (or the jurisdiction where a disregarded entity or branch of an FFI is organized, identified in Part II of the form) was included on the list of jurisdictions treated as having an intergovernmental agreement in effect and is removed from that list or when the FATCA status of the jurisdiction changes (for example, from Model 2 to Model 1). The list of agreements is maintained at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDefinitions\\n\\nAccount.\\nWith respect to QI, including a QI acting as a QDD, an account is defined in section 2.01 of the QI Agreement.\\n\\n\\nAccount holder.\\nAn account holder is generally the person listed or identified as the holder or owner of a financial account (other than an agent or nominee that is not an FFI). For example, if a partnership is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, then the partnership is the account holder rather than the partners of the partnership. However, an account that is held by a disregarded entity is treated as held by the person owning the entity. With respect to a QI acting as a QDD, see section 2.02 of the QI Agreement for the definition of account holder.\\n\\n\\nAmounts subject to withholding.\\nGenerally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. Amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding do not include amounts that are not FDAP, such as most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID).\\nAmounts subject to chapter 4 withholding are payments of U.S. source FDAP income that are withholdable payments as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a) and to which no exception under Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) applies (for example, certain nonfinancial payments are excepted from the definition of withholdable payment). The exemptions from withholding provided for under chapter 3 are not applicable when determining whether withholding applies under chapter 4. \\nFor purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. \\n\\n\\nBeneficial owner.\\nFor payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income. \\nForeign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not itself a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. \\nThe beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself.\\n\\nNote.\\nA payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee that is not subject to 30% withholding for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. For purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust or disregarded entity shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9 in its own right. Rather, the grantor or other owner shall provide the withholding agent the appropriate form. \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nChapter 3.\\nChapter 3 means chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 withholding rate pool.\\nA chapter 3 withholding rate pool is a payment of a single type of income, based on the categories of income reported on Form 1042-S (for example, interest or dividends), that is not subject to withholding under chapter 4 but is subject to a single rate of withholding for chapter 3 purposes and is paid to foreign persons or, in the case of a zero-percent pool, U.S. exempt recipients not included in a separate pool of exempt recipients. \\n\\n\\nChapter 4.\\nChapter 4 means chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 status.\\nThe term chapter 4 status means a person’s status as a U.S. person, specified U.S. person, foreign individual, participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, restricted distributor, exempt beneficial owner, nonparticipating FFI, territory financial institution, excepted NFFE, or passive NFFE.\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 withholding rate pool.\\nThe term chapter 4 withholding rate pool means a pool identified on a withholding statement provided by an intermediary or flow-through entity with respect to a withholdable payment that is allocated to payees that are nonparticipating FFIs. The term chapter 4 withholding rate pool also includes a pool identified on an FFI withholding statement provided by a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI with respect to a withholdable payment that is allocated to a class of recalcitrant account holders as described in Regulations section 1.1471- 4(d)(6) (or with respect to an FFI that is a QI, a single pool of recalcitrant account holders without the need to subdivide into each class of recalcitrant account holder), including a pool of account holders to which the escrow procedures for dormant accounts apply. Finally, a chapter 4 withholding rate pool also includes a pool of U.S. persons included in a U.S. payee pool described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4) provided by a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), or a QI.\\n\\n\\nDeemed-compliant FFI.\\nUnder section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a GIIN. These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1) and also an applicable IGA for entities treated as registered deemed-compliant FFIs.\\n\\n\\nDisregarded entity.\\nA business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. A disregarded entity does not submit Form W-8IMY to a withholding agent or FFI. Instead, the owner of such entity provides the appropriate documentation (for example, a Form W-8BEN-E if the owner is a foreign entity that is not a QDD). However, if a disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment is an FFI outside the single owner’s country of organization or has its own GIIN, see the instructions to Part II of Form W-8IMY for when to provide the chapter 4 status of the disregarded entity receiving the payment.\\nCertain entities that are disregarded for U.S. tax purposes may nevertheless be treated as treaty residents for purposes of claiming treaty benefits under an applicable tax treaty (see the definition of hybrid entity, later). See Form W-8BEN-E and the accompanying instructions for more information about a hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf as a resident of a treaty jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\nFinancial account.\\nA financial account includes: \\n\\n\\n\\nA depository account maintained by an FFI; \\n\\n\\nA custodial account maintained by an FFI; \\n\\n\\nEquity or debt interests (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market) in investment entities and certain holding companies, treasury centers, or financial institutions;\\n\\n\\nCertain cash value insurance contracts; and\\n\\n\\nAnnuity contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor purposes of chapter 4, exceptions are provided for accounts such as certain tax-favored savings accounts, term life insurance contracts, accounts held by estates, escrow accounts, and certain annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2). Accounts may also be excluded from the definition of financial account under an applicable IGA.\\n\\n\\nFinancial institution.\\nA financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(e).\\n\\n\\nFiscally transparent entity.\\nAn entity is treated as fiscally transparent with respect to an item of income to the extent that the interest holders in the entity must, on a current basis, take into account separately their shares of an item of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed, and must determine the character of the items of income as if they were realized directly from the sources from which realized by the entity. For example, partnerships, common trust funds, and simple trusts or grantor trusts are generally considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to items of income received by them.\\n\\n\\nFlow-through entity.\\nA flow-through entity is a foreign partnership (other than a withholding foreign partnership), a foreign simple or foreign grantor trust (other than a withholding foreign trust), or, for payments for which a reduced rate of withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, any entity to the extent the entity is considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to the payment by an interest holder’s jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\nForeign financial institution (FFI).\\nA foreign financial institution (FFI) generally means a foreign entity that is a financial institution.\\n\\n\\nForeign person.\\nA foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign person. \\n\\n\\nGlobal intermediary identification number (GIIN).\\nA GIIN is the identification number assigned to an entity that has registered with the IRS for chapter 4 purposes. \\n\\n\\nHybrid entity.\\nA hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is treated as fiscally transparent (rather than as a beneficial owner) under the Code but is not treated as fiscally transparent by a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. Hybrid entity status is relevant for claiming treaty benefits for purposes of chapter 3. A hybrid entity, may, however, be considered the payee for purposes of chapter 4 (see Regulations section 1.1471-3(a) defining who is a payee of a withholdable payment). See the special instructions for hybrid entities, later, and Regulations section 1.1471-3(d) for the documentation requirements with respect to entities receiving withholdable payments.\\n\\n\\nIntergovernmental Agreement (IGA).\\nAn IGA means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, go to www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx. \\nA Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency thereof, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI.\\nA Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency thereof and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that registered with the IRS to obtain a GIIN and agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is treated as a participating FFI but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI. \\nThe term reporting IGA FFI refers to both reporting Model 1 FFIs and reporting Model 2 FFIs.\\n\\n\\nIntermediary.\\nAn intermediary is any person that acts as a custodian, broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for another person, regardless of whether that other person is the beneficial owner of the amount paid, a flow-through entity, or another intermediary. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nQualified intermediary (QI).\\nA QI is a person that is a party to a withholding agreement with the IRS (described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii)) and is: \\n\\n\\n\\nA foreign financial institution (other than a U.S. branch of an FFI) that is a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including an FFI treated as a deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA subject to due diligence and reporting requirements similar to those applicable to a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1), including the requirement to register with the IRS), or any other category of FFI identified in the QI agreement;\\n\\n\\nA foreign person that is a home office or has a branch that is an eligible entity (as described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6)(ii), without regard to the requirement that the person be a qualified intermediary);\\n\\n\\nA foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or a foreign branch or office of a U.S. clearing organization; or \\n\\n\\nA foreign entity not described above that the IRS accepts as a qualified intermediary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQualified derivatives dealer (QDD).\\nA QDD is a qualified intermediary that is an eligible entity that agrees to meet the requirements of Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6)(i) and the QI agreement. An eligible entity is defined in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6)(ii).\\nTo act as a QDD, the home office or branch, as applicable, must qualify and be approved for QDD status and must represent itself as a QDD on its Form W-8IMY and separately identify the home office or branch as a recipient on a withholding statement (if required). Each home office or branch that obtains QDD status is treated as a separate QDD.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQualified securities lender (QSL).\\nNotice 2010-46, available at IRS.gov/irb/2010-24_IRB/ar09.html, provided rules for QSLs acting with respect to payments of substitute dividends. A QSL should certify to its QSL status in Part III of this form, even if it is not a qualified intermediary. An entity will no longer be able to claim QSL status as of January 1, 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNonqualified intermediary.\\nA nonqualified intermediary is any intermediary that is not a U.S. person and that is not a qualified intermediary. \\n\\n\\n\\nNonreporting IGA FFI.\\nA nonreporting IGA FFI is an FFI that is a resident of, or located or established in, a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that meets the requirements of:\\n\\n\\n\\nA nonreporting financial institution described in a specific category in Annex II of the Model 1 or Model 2 IGA;\\n\\n\\nA registered deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(A) through (F);\\n\\n\\nA certified deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(2)(i) through (v); or\\n\\n\\nAn exempt beneficial owner described in Regulations section 1.1471-6.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNonwithholding foreign partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust.\\nA nonwithholding foreign partnership is any foreign partnership other than a withholding foreign partnership. A nonwithholding foreign simple trust is any foreign simple trust that is not a withholding foreign trust. A nonwithholding foreign grantor trust is any foreign grantor trust that is not a withholding foreign trust.\\n\\n\\nParticipating FFI.\\nA participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term participating FFI also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution, unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI.\\n\\n\\nPayee.\\nA payee is generally a person to whom a payment is made, regardless of whether such person is the beneficial owner. For a payment made to a financial account, the payee is generally the holder of the financial account. However, under certain circumstances a person who receives a payment will not be considered the payee. For purposes of chapter 3, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2) and for chapter 4, see Regulations section 1.1471-3(a)(3).\\n\\n\\nReportable amount.\\nSolely for purposes of the statements required to be attached to Form W-8IMY, a reportable amount is an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3, U.S. source deposit interest (including original issue discount), and U.S. source interest or original issue discount on the redemption of short-term obligations. It does not include payments on deposits with banks and other financial institutions that remain on deposit for 2 weeks or less or amounts received from the sale or exchange (other than a redemption) of a short-term obligation that is effected outside the United States. It also does not include amounts of original issue discount arising from a sale and repurchase transaction completed within a period of 2 weeks or less, or amounts described in Regulations section 1.6049-5(b)(7), (10), or (11) (relating to certain obligations issued in bearer form). \\n\\n\\nReverse hybrid entity.\\nA reverse hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is not fiscally transparent under U.S. tax law principles but that is fiscally transparent under the laws of a jurisdiction with which the United States has an income tax treaty. \\n\\n\\nTerritory financial institution.\\nThe term territory financial institution means a financial institution that is incorporated or organized under the laws of any U.S. territory. However, an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company is not a territory financial institution. A territory financial institution acting as an intermediary or that is a flow-through entity may agree to be treated as a U.S. person under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A). \\n\\n\\nWithholdable payment.\\nThe term withholdable payment is defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a). \\n\\n\\nWithholding agent.\\nAny person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or a withholdable payment under chapter 4 is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies.\\nFor purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent may be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6. \\n\\n\\nWithholding foreign partnership (WP) or withholding foreign trust (WT).\\nA WP or WT is a foreign partnership or a foreign simple or grantor trust that has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS in which it agrees to assume primary withholding responsibility for purposes of chapter 4 and under sections 1441 and 1442 for all payments that are made to its partners, beneficiaries, or owners, except as otherwise provided in the withholding agreement. A WP also includes a foreign reverse hybrid entity that has entered into a withholding agreement.\\n\\n\\nWithholding statement.\\nA withholding statement provides an allocation (by income type) to each payee (or withholding rate pool, if applicable, or other pool of payees to the extent permitted under the chapter 3 or 4 regulations) of each payment an intermediary or flow-through entity receives. The withholding statement forms an integral part of the withholding certificate, and the penalties of perjury statement provided on the withholding certificate shall apply to the withholding statement. The withholding statement may be provided in any manner upon which the intermediary or the flow-through entity and the withholding agent mutually agree, including electronically if certain safeguards concerning electronic transmission are met. A withholding statement also provides information required for purposes of chapter 4 if the intermediary or flow-through entity is receiving a withholdable payment, in which case the entity must provide an FFI withholding statement, chapter 4 withholding statement, or exempt beneficial owner withholding statement (as applicable). See Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B). Additional information is required for a withholding statement from a QDD.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific Instructions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart I — Identification of Entity\\n\\nLine 1.\\nEnter your name. By doing so, you are representing to the payer or withholding agent that you are not the beneficial owner of the amounts that will be paid to you (unless you are acting as a QDD or QSL for certain payments associated with this form or you are a QI acting with respect to payments of substitute interest, as permitted by the QI agreement). If you are a disregarded entity, do not enter the business name of the disregarded entity here. Instead, enter the legal name of the entity that owns the disregarded entity (looking through multiple disregarded entities, if applicable).\\n\\n\\nLine 2.\\nIf you are a corporation, enter the country of incorporation. If you are another type of entity, enter the country under whose laws you are created, organized, or governed. \\n\\n\\nLine 3.\\nIf you are a disregarded entity receiving a payment, enter your name (if required). You are required to complete line 3 if you are a disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment or hold an account with an FFI requesting this form and you: \\n\\n\\n\\nHave registered with the IRS and been assigned a GIIN associated with the legal name of the disregarded entity; and\\n\\n\\nAre a reporting Model 1 FFI or reporting Model 2 FFI .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are not required to provide the legal name of the disregarded entity, however, you may want to notify the withholding agent that you are a disregarded entity receiving a payment or maintaining an account by indicating the name of the disregarded entity on line 10. \\n\\n\\nLine 4.\\nComplete this line to establish your entity status for purposes of chapter 3. Check the one box that applies. If you are a foreign partnership receiving the payment on behalf of your partners, check the \"Withholding foreign partnership\" box or the \"Nonwithholding foreign partnership\" box, whichever is appropriate. If you are a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust receiving the payment on behalf of your beneficiaries or owners, check the \"Withholding foreign trust\" box, the \"Nonwithholding foreign simple trust\" box, or the \"Nonwithholding foreign grantor trust\" box, whichever is appropriate. If you are a foreign partnership (or a foreign trust) receiving a payment on behalf of persons other than your partners (or beneficiaries or owners), check the \"Qualified intermediary\" box or the \"Nonqualified intermediary\" box, whichever is appropriate. A foreign reverse hybrid entity that is providing documentation from its interest holders to claim a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty should check the appropriate box (including \"Withholding foreign partnership\" or \"Withholding foreign trust\" if the entity has entered into a withholding agreement). A partnership or grantor trust submitting Form W-8IMY solely because it is allocated income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business as a partner in a partnership should check the box for nonwithholding foreign partnership or nonwithholding foreign grantor trust and, if it is submitting or will submit documentation for its partners or owners, it should complete Part VIII.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm W-8IMY may be provided to satisfy documentation requirements for purposes of withholding on certain partnership allocations to foreign partners under section 1446. Section 1446 generally requires withholding when a partnership is conducting a trade or business in the United States and allocates income effectively connected with that trade or business (ECI) to foreign persons that are partners in the partnership. Section 1446 can also apply when certain income is treated as effectively connected income of the partnership and is so allocated. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nAn upper-tier partnership that is allocated ECI as a partner in a partnership may, in certain circumstances, have the lower-tier partnership perform its withholding obligation. Generally, this is accomplished by the upper-tier partnership submitting withholding certificates of its partners (for example, Form W-8BEN) along with a Form W-8IMY, which identifies itself as a partnership, and identifying the manner in which ECI of the upper-tier partnership will be allocated to the partners. For further information, see Regulations section 1.1446-5. A foreign grantor trust that is allocated ECI as a partner in a partnership should provide the withholding certificates of its grantor (for example, Form W-8BEN) along with its Form W-8IMY which identifies the trust as a foreign grantor trust. See Regulations section 1.1446-1(c)(2)(ii)(E) for the rules requiring it to provide additional documentation to the partnership. \\n\\n\\nLine 5.\\nCheck the one box that applies to your chapter 4 status. You are only required to provide a chapter 4 status if you are acting as an intermediary with respect to a withholdable payment, you are a flow-through entity receiving a withholdable payment on behalf of your owners (including a reverse hybrid entity providing documentation on behalf of its owners to claim treaty benefits), you are providing a withholding statement associated with this form that allocates a portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees with respect to your direct account holders (as described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)), you are providing this form to an FFI requesting this form to document your chapter 4 status, or you are a QI (including a QDD), WP, or WT. If you are a U.S. branch that does not agree to be treated as a U.S. person and that does not make the certification on line 19c, you should check nonparticipating FFI; otherwise, leave line 5 blank. By checking a box on this line, you are representing that you qualify for this classification.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor most of the chapter 4 classifications, you are required to complete additional certifications found in Parts IX through XXVIII. Complete the appropriate part of this form certifying that you meet the conditions of the status indicated on line 5 (as defined under Regulations sections 1.1471-5 or 1.1471-6). Complete the required portion of this form before signing and providing it to the withholding agent.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFFIs Covered by IGAs and Related Entities\\nA reporting FFI resident in, or established under the laws of, a jurisdiction covered by a Model 1 IGA should check \"Reporting Model 1 FFI.\" A reporting FFI resident in, or established under the laws of, a jurisdiction covered by a Model 2 IGA should check \"Reporting Model 2 FFI.\" If you are treated as a registered deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA, you should check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI\" rather than \"registered deemed-compliant FFI\" and provide your GIIN. See the specific instructions for Part XIX. In general, if you are treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI under an applicable IGA, you should check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI\" even if you meet the qualifications for deemed-compliant status under the chapter 4 regulations. In such a case, you need not also check your applicable status under the regulations but should provide your GIIN on line 9. However, an owner documented FFI that is treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI under an applicable IGA must check \"Owner-documented FFI\" and complete Part XI. An FFI that is related to a reporting IGA FFI and that is treated as a nonparticipating FFI in its country of residence should check nonparticipating FFI in line 5. An FFI that is related to a reporting IGA FFI and that is a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or exempt beneficial owner under the U.S. Treasury regulations or an applicable IGA should check the appropriate box depending on its chapter 4 status rather than the box for nonparticipating FFI.\\nIf you are an FFI in a jurisdiction treated as having an IGA in effect, you should not check \"Participating FFI\" and should check \"Reporting Model 1 FFI\" or \"Reporting Model 2 FFI\" as applicable.\\nSee www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx for a list of jurisdictions treated as having an IGA in effect.\\n\\n\\nLine 6.\\nEnter the permanent address of the entity identified on line 1. Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for purposes of that country\\'s income tax. Do not show the address of a financial institution (other than yourself), a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless such address is the only permanent address you use and it appears in your organizational documents (that is, your registered address). If you do not have a tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is where you maintain your principal office. \\n\\n\\nLine 7.\\nEnter your mailing address only if it is different from the address you show on line 6. \\n\\n\\nLine 8.\\nYou must provide an employer identification number (EIN) if you are a U.S. branch or territory financial institution, an upper-tier partnership that is allocated ECI as a partner in a partnership, or a foreign grantor trust that is allocated ECI as a partner. \\nIf you are acting as a qualified intermediary (including a QDD), withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust, check the appropriate box and enter the EIN that was issued to you in such capacity (your \"QI-EIN,\" \"WP-EIN,\" or \"WT-EIN\"). If you are not acting in that capacity, you must use your U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN), if any, that is not your QI-EIN, WP-EIN, or WT-EIN. \\nA nonqualified intermediary, a nonwithholding foreign partnership, or a nonwithholding foreign simple or grantor trust is generally not required to provide a U.S. TIN. However, a QSL providing this form with respect to a U.S. source substitute dividend must provide an EIN (including a QI-EIN if the QSL is a QI).\\n\\n\\nLine 9.\\nIf you are a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI and a sponsored FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(F)), direct reporting NFFE (including a sponsored direct reporting NFFE), or trustee of a trustee documented trust that is a foreign person, you are required to enter your GIIN (with regard to your country of residence) on line 9. If you are a trustee of a trustee-documented trust and you are a foreign person, you should provide the GIIN that you received when you registered as a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI. In addition, you must provide your GIIN on line 9 if you are a nonreporting IGA FFI that is (1) treated as registered deemed-compliant under Annex II to an applicable Model 2 IGA or (2) a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1).\\nIf you are a QI acting as a QDD, you must provide your GIIN on line 9 if you have one.\\nIf you are a certified deemed-compliant FFI described in Part XIV of this form, provide the GIIN of your sponsoring entity on line 9.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are in the process of registering with the IRS as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a sponsored FFI), reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, direct reporting NFFE, sponsored direct reporting NFFE, or nonreporting IGA FFI but have not received a GIIN, you may complete this line by writing \"applied for.\" However, the person requesting this form from you must receive and verify your GIIN within 90 days.\\nIf you are a disregarded entity that completed Part I, line 3, do not enter your GIIN on line 9. Instead, enter it on line 13.\\n\\nLine 10.\\nYou, or a withholding agent, may use this line to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its reporting and withholding obligations. For example, a withholding agent who is required to associate a particular Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E with this Form W-8IMY may use line 10 for a referencing number or code that will make the association clear. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart II — Disregarded Entity or Branch Receiving Payment\\nComplete Part II for a disregarded entity that has its own GIIN and is receiving a withholdable payment or for a branch (including a branch that is a disregarded entity that does not have its own GIIN) operating in a jurisdiction other than the country of residence identified in line 2. For example, assume ABC Co., which is a participating FFI resident in Country A, operates through a branch in Country B (which is a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction) and the branch is treated as a reporting Model 1 FFI under the terms of the Country B Model 1 IGA. ABC Co. should not enter its GIIN on line 9, and the Country B branch should complete this Part II by identifying itself as a reporting Model 1 FFI and providing its GIIN on line 13. If the Country B branch receiving the payment is a disregarded entity, you may be required to provide its legal name on line 3.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf the disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment has its own GIIN, Part II should be completed regardless of whether it is in the same country as the single owner identified in Part I.\\nIf you have multiple branches/disregarded entities receiving payments from the same withholding agent and the information in Part I is the same for each branch/disregarded entity that will receive payments, you may provide (and a withholding agent may accept) a single Form W-8IMY with a separate schedule attached that includes all of the Part II information for each branch/disregarded entity rather than separate Forms W-8IMY to identify each branch receiving payments associated with the form. You must also provide the withholding agent with sufficient information to associate the payments with each branch/disregarded entity.\\nIf you are a QDD home office or you are a QI and have one or more QDD branches, do not complete Part II for any branches that are acting in their QDD capacities. Instead, provide the relevant branch information that you would otherwise provide on Part II (including the information required for chapter 4 purposes, as required) on your withholding statement.\\n\\nLine 11.\\nCheck the one box that applies. If no box applies to the disregarded entity, you do not need to complete Part II. If you check reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, or participating FFI, you must complete line 13. If you are a branch of a reporting IGA FFI that cannot comply with the requirements of an applicable IGA or the regulations under chapter 4, you must check branch treated as nonparticipating FFI. If you are a QI that is an NFFE and a withholding agent requests your chapter 4 status, you may provide a statement certifying to your chapter 4 status as an NFFE.\\n\\n\\nLine 12.\\nEnter the address of the branch or disregarded entity. \\n\\n\\nLine 13.\\nIf you are a reporting Model 1 FFI, a reporting Model 2 FFI, or a participating FFI, you must enter on line 13 the GIIN of your branch that receives the payment. If you are a disregarded entity that completed Part I, line 3 of this form and are receiving payments associated with this form, enter your GIIN. Do not enter your GIIN (if any) on line 9. If you are a U.S. branch, do not enter a GIIN on line 13. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are in the process of registering your branch with the IRS but have not received a GIIN, you may complete this line by writing “applied for.” However, the person requesting this form from you must receive and verify your GIIN within 90 days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCertification of Chapter 3 Status: Parts III Through VIII\\nYou should only complete one part from Parts III through VIII. Generally, if you are acting in multiple capacities, you should provide separate Forms W-8IMY for each capacity. For example, if you are acting as a qualified intermediary for one account, but a nonqualified intermediary for another account, you should provide one Form W-8IMY in your capacity as a qualified intermediary and a separate Form W-8IMY in your capacity as a nonqualified intermediary.\\nYou may, however, provide a single Form W-8IMY that covers more than one category of QI provided that you properly identify the accounts and/or transactions, as required, on a withholding statement. For example, if you are a QI that acts as both a QI and a QDD, you may provide a single Form W-8IMY with a withholding statement designating each type of account or transaction.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart III — Qualified Intermediary\\nCheck box 14 if you are a qualified intermediary (QI) (whether or not you assume primary withholding responsibility) for the payments for which you are providing this form. By checking the box, you are certifying to the applicable statements contained on line 14. See the QI agreement for the definition of \"account\" for purposes of Part III.\\nComplete line 15 only if you are acting as a QI that is not a QDD. To the extent you are a QI acting as a QDD, see the instructions for line 16.\\nCheck box 15a if you have assumed primary withholding responsibility under both chapter 3 and chapter 4 with respect to the account(s). This box may be checked regardless of which boxes you check for boxes 15b through 15f for any accounts identified on a withholding statement.\\nCheck box 15b if you have assumed primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility with respect to the accounts identified in a withholding statement associated with this form or if you are a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that meets the requirements to report only under Regulations sections 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii). For accounts for which you check this box 15b, you should not check boxes 15c through 15f.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you checked boxes 15a and 15b with respect to any accounts, you do not have to provide a withholding statement for payments made to those accounts.\\nCheck box 15c if you have not assumed primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility. If you check box 15c, check the applicable certification(s) in 15d or 15e.\\nIf you are allocating any portion of the payment on a withholding statement to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees in lieu of providing Forms W-9, you must certify by checking boxes 15d and/or 15e (as applicable):\\n\\n\\n\\nFor each account holder included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees who holds an account that you maintain, you are permitted to provide this pool under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) (including for payments of income other than interest for which reporting would be required under chapter 61 but for a coordination rule similar to that provided in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii)); and/or\\n\\n\\nFor a withholding rate pool of U.S. payees that includes account holders of another intermediary or flow-through entity, you have obtained or will obtain documentation to establish that the intermediary or flow-through entity is a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or a qualified intermediary. See Regulations sections 1.1471-3(d)(4) and 1.1471-3(e) for more information on the requirements for documenting such chapter 4 statuses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA payment that is subject to chapter 3 withholding or that should be subject to chapter 4 withholding may not be included in a U.S. payee pool that is described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(ii).\\nAlthough, as a QI, you obtain withholding certificates or appropriate documentation from beneficial owners or payees, as specified in your QI agreement, you do not need to attach the certificates or documentation to this form. However, to the extent you have not assumed primary Form 1099 reporting or backup withholding responsibility and are not permitted to allocate the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii), you must disclose the names of those U.S. persons for whom you receive reportable amounts and that are not exempt recipients (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) or under section 6041, 6042, 6045, or 6050N). You should make this disclosure by attaching to Form W-8IMY the Forms W-9 (or substitute forms) of persons that are U.S. non-exempt recipients. If you do not have a Form W-9 for a non-exempt U.S. payee, you must attach to Form W-8IMY any information you do have regarding that person’s name, address, and TIN for a withholding agent to report the payment.\\nCheck box 15f to certify that you are a QI that is acting as a QSL with respect to all payments associated with this form that are U.S. source substitute dividends made by a party to a securities lending transaction (as described in Notice 2010-46) for payments made before January 1, 2018.\\nCheck line 15g to certify that you are a QI that is assuming primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 and primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility with respect to all payments associated with this form that are U.S. source interest and substitute interest payments, as permitted by (and described in) the QI agreement. You may act as a QI with respect to such substitute interest payments under the QI agreement regardless of whether you are acting in a principal or intermediary capacity with respect to payments of interest and substitute interest you receive that are associated with this form.\\n\\nLine 16a.\\nCheck the box in line 16a to certify that each QDD identified on the form or on the withholding statement that is acting as a QDD meets the requirements to act as a QDD in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6) and assumes primary withholding and reporting responsibilities under chapters 3, 4, and 61, and section 3406 with respect to potential section 871(m) transactions.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA QI that is acting as a QDD should provide this Form W-8IMY only for payments in respect of potential section 871(m) transactions and underlying securities. To certify your foreign status for any other payment of U.S. source income you beneficially own, see Who Must Provide Form W-8IMY, earlier.\\n\\nLine 16b.\\nCheck the box to indicate your status, including if you are a QDD that is a disregarded entity claiming treaty benefits. If the QDD is a branch other than a disregarded entity (that is, a branch that is not a separate legal entity from its home office), check the box to indicate the status of the entity identified in Part I.\\n\\n\\nClaim of treaty benefits.\\nIf you are acting as a QDD, you may be entitled to claim treaty benefits for certain payments that are subject to withholding that you receive in your principal capacity (for example, interest payments or payments of dividends beginning in 2018). To make a claim for treaty benefits in such a case, you may provide your withholding agent a statement associated with your Form W-8IMY that contains the information required in Part III of Form W-8BEN-E, including (if applicable) a treaty claim by a hybrid entity that is a disregarded entity that is identified on a QDD\\'s withholding statement described in the instructions to Part II. Alternatively, a Form W-8BEN-E may be used for this purpose.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are acting as a QDD and fiscally transparent in your jurisdiction of organization, do not claim treaty benefits as described in these instructions. Instead, you must include the withholding certificates or documentary evidence of the owners claiming treaty benefits and provide an allocation on the withholding statement.\\n\\nQDD branch of a U.S. person.\\nIf you are a foreign branch of a U.S. person that is acting as a QDD and you receive a payment that otherwise would be subject to withholding except for the U.S. person’s status as a U.S. person, you may associate this Form W-8IMY with a Form W-9 from the U.S. person.\\n\\n\\nWithholding statement of a QI.\\nAs a QI, you must provide a withholding statement to each withholding agent from which you receive reportable amounts or withholdable payments if you have not assumed primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 with respect to the payment and, if you are receiving a reportable amount on behalf of a U.S. non-exempt recipient, you have not assumed primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility for the payment. The withholding statement becomes an integral part of the Form W-8IMY and, therefore, the certification statement that you sign in Part XXIX of the form applies to the withholding statement as well as to the form.\\n\\nA QI withholding statement must:\\n\\n\\n\\nDesignate those accounts for which you act as a QI,\\n\\n\\nDesignate those accounts for which you are assuming primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 of the Code,\\n\\n\\nIf applicable, designate those accounts or payments for which you are acting as a QSL with respect to any U.S. source substitute dividends, and\\n\\n\\nProvide information to allocate the payment, as applicable, to chapter 3 withholding rate pools, chapter 4 withholding rate pools, or other pools of payees permitted under the chapter 4 regulations. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor chapter 4 purposes.\\nIf you are a QI and you receive a withholdable payment, you must provide a withholding statement which satisfies the requirements of an FFI withholding statement or chapter 4 withholding statement (if you are not an FFI) when you do not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 and Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility for the payment.\\nIf you are a QI that is an FFI you may provide an FFI withholding statement to allocate the payment to chapter 4 withholding rate pools (as applicable) or other pool of payees permitted on an FFI withholding statement under the chapter 4 regulations. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2). You may also provide on the withholding statement a single pool of nonparticipating FFIs, a single pool of recalcitrant account holders of yours or of or another intermediary that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, and, if you do not assume primary Form 1099 and backup withholding responsibility, a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. A chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees may include:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are a reporting Model 1 FFI, an account holder that is not withheld on under chapter 3, chapter 4, or section 3406 that you report as a U.S. account pursuant to the Model 1 IGA because the account has U.S. indicia and you have not obtained appropriate documentation to treat the account as held by other than a specified U.S. person;\\n\\n\\nIf you are a reporting Model 2 FFI, an account holder that is not withheld on under chapter 3, chapter 4, or section 3406 that you report as an account holder of a non-consenting U.S. account as described in the Model 2 IGA;\\n\\n\\nIf you are a non-U.S. payor (as described in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(5)) that is a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI, or reporting Model 1 FFI, an account holder not withheld on under chapter 4 or section 3406 who you report under chapter 4 or an applicable IGA (including the account holder’s TIN).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAn FFI withholding statement must also identify each intermediary or flow-through entity that is receiving a payment on behalf of a payee and include such entity’s chapter 4 status and GIIN (if applicable), excluding any intermediary or flow-through entity that is an account holder or interest holder in another QI, WP, or WT. An FFI withholding statement of a QI may combine withholding rate pool information provided by such an entity to the QI with withholding rate pools comprised of accounts that the QI maintains.\\nIf you are a QI that is not an FFI and that does not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4, you must provide, for a withholdable payment, a chapter 4 withholding statement that contains the name, address, TIN (if any), entity type (if applicable), and chapter 4 status of each payee, the amount allocated to each payee, a valid withholding certificate or other documentation sufficient to establish the payee’s chapter 4 status. However, a chapter 4 withholding statement may include pooled information for payees that are nonparticipating FFIs that hold accounts that you maintain or hold accounts with an intermediary or flow-through entity receiving the payment from you. You may also provide another pool of payees as permitted under the chapter 4 regulations for a chapter 4 withholding statement. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor chapter 3 purposes.\\nIn the case of a reportable amount that is a withholdable payment, any portion of the payment for which you are acting as a QI that is not allocated to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool or a U.S. non-exempt recipient (including for backup withholding purposes) must be allocated to a chapter 3 withholding rate pool or pool of U.S. exempt recipients, if it is not required to be separately reported. The chapter 3 withholding rate pool may be established by any reasonable method agreed upon by you and the withholding agent. For example, you may agree to establish a separate account for a single chapter 3 withholding rate pool or you may agree to divide a payment made to a single account into portions allocable to each chapter 3 withholding rate pool. You must provide the chapter 3 withholding rate pool information that is required for the withholding agent to meet its withholding and reporting obligations. A withholding agent may request any information reasonably necessary to withhold and report payments correctly.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nForm 1099 reporting.\\nIf you do not assume primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility, you must provide payee specific information for each U.S. non-exempt recipient account holder (other than those U.S. payees included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii)) or when the alternative procedure is used. The pools are based on valid documentation that you obtain or, if a payment cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation, the applicable presumption rules.\\n\\nExample 1.\\nA QI that is a participating FFI receives a $100 payment of U.S. source dividends on an account for which it acts as a QI held with the withholding agent for the following recipients:\\n\\n\\n\\n$20 to NPFFI, a nonparticipating FFI that is an account holder of the QI;\\n\\n\\n$10 each on behalf of two recalcitrant account holders of the QI ($20 total), each with U.S. indicia (as described in Regulations section 1.1441-7(b)(5)) associated with the account;\\n\\n\\n$5 each on behalf of A and B, U.S. individual account holders of the QI that the QI reports as U.S. accounts pursuant to its chapter 4 reporting obligations as a participating FFI ($10 total);\\n\\n\\n$10 on behalf of C, a U.S. exempt recipient that is not a specified U.S. person and is an indirect account holder of the QI (who beneficially owns the payment through an account with another participating FFI);\\n\\n\\n$20 on behalf of D, a U.S. non-exempt recipient that is a specified U.S. person who is an indirect account holder of the QI (that beneficially owns the payment through an account with a certified deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(2)); and\\n\\n\\n$10 each on behalf of two nonresident alien individuals who are account holders of the QI, one of whom is entitled to a 15% rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe dividend payment is both a withholdable payment under chapter 4 and a reportable amount under chapter 3. The QI assumes primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 as well as primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility. As a result, the QI is not required to provide a withholding statement allocating the payment to specific payees or withholding rate pools. The QI will provide Form W-8IMY and check boxes 14, 15a, and 15b.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nExample 2.\\nThe facts are the same as Example 1, except QI is a non-U.S. payor under Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(5) and does not assume primary Form 1099 and backup withholding responsibility but reports the accounts of A and B as U.S. accounts under Regulations section 1.1471-4(d).\\nThe QI must provide a withholding statement allocating $20 of the payment to D, $10 to C, and $10 to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. The QI need not allocate any portion of the payment specifically to A or B because the QI is a non-U.S. payor that is permitted to include A and B in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i). For payments made on or after April 1, 2017, see the instructions to Part IV of this form for when a withholding statement includes an allocation of a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding that is made to a pool of U.S. payees. The QI must also provide a Form W-9 (or alternatively, name and TIN) for D. A Form W-9 is not required for C. The QI will provide Form W-8IMY and check boxes 14, 15a, and 15d.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nExample 3.\\nThe facts are the same as Example 1, except the QI is a U.S. payor and does not assume primary Form 1099 and backup withholding responsibility.\\nBecause the QI is a U.S. payor, it is not permitted, under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i) and (iii), to include A and B in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. The QI must provide a withholding statement allocating $5 of the payment to A, $5 of the payment to B, $10 of the payment to C, and $20 of the payment to D along with Forms W-9 (or name and TIN) for A, B, and D. The QI will provide Form W-8IMY and check boxes 14 and 15a.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nExample 4.\\nThe facts are the same as Example 1, except the QI is a non-U.S. payor that does not assume primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4. The QI also does not assume primary Form 1099 and backup withholding responsibility.\\nIf the QI does not assume primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 as well as primary Form 1099 reporting and separate backup withholding responsibilities, the QI will provide an FFI withholding statement with the following pools:\\n\\n\\n\\nNonparticipating FFI Pool — $20 (which is subject to chapter 4 withholding);\\n\\n\\nRecalcitrant Account Holder Pool — $20 (which is subject to chapter 4 withholding and which is aggregated in a single pool of recalcitrant account holders rather than each class described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(6));\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 Withholding Rate Pool of U.S. Payees — $10 (for the portion of the payment allocable to A and B);\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 30% Rate Pool — $10;\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 15% Rate Pool — $10; and\\n\\n\\n0% Rate Pool — $10 (for the portion of the payment allocable to C).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe QI will also be required to allocate $20 to a separate withholding rate pool for D because D is a U.S. non-exempt recipient who cannot be included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (because D’s account is maintained by a certified deemed-compliant FFI). The QI will provide Form W-8IMY and check boxes 14, 15c, and 15d.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAlternative procedure for U.S. non-exempt recipients.\\nIf approved by the withholding agent, you can establish:\\n\\n\\n\\nA single pool (not subject to backup withholding) for all U.S. non-exempt recipient account holders for whom you have provided Forms W-9 or are includible in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees prior to the withholding agent making any payments. Alternatively, you may include such U.S. non-exempt recipients in a zero rate withholding pool that includes U.S. exempt recipients and foreign persons exempt from non-resident alien withholding provided all the conditions of the alternative procedure are met; and\\n\\n\\nA separate pool for all U.S. non-exempt recipient account holders subject to backup withholding for whom you have not provided Forms W-9 prior to the withholding agent making any payments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you elect the alternative procedure, you must provide the allocation information required by your QI withholding agreement to the withholding agent no later than January 15 of the year following the year in which the payments are paid. Failure to provide this information may result in penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 and termination of your withholding agreement with the IRS.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe amount allocable to these two pools under the alternative procedure excludes amounts allocated to the chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees.\\n\\n\\nUpdating the statement.\\nYour withholding statement must be updated as often as is necessary to allow the withholding agent to withhold at the appropriate rate on each payment and to correctly report the income to the IRS. The updated information becomes an integral part of Form W-8IMY. \\n\\n\\nQDD withholding statement.\\nIn addition to the information required on a withholding statement (if any) you provide in your QI capacity, a QDD withholding statement should (as applicable) for each QDD:\\n\\n\\n\\nDesignate the accounts for which the QDD is receiving dividend equivalent or dividend payments with respect to potential section 871(m) transactions or underlying securities (as defined in Regulations section 1.871-15(a)(15)), respectfully, as a QDD;\\n\\n\\nDesignate the accounts for which the QDD is receiving dividend equivalents with respect to potential section 871(m) transactions as a QDD (and that are not underlying securities) for which withholding is not required; \\n\\n\\nDesignate the accounts for which the QDD is receiving payments with respect to underlying securities for which withholding is required as a QDD; and\\n\\n\\nIdentify the home office or branch that is treated as the owner for U.S. income tax purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are acting as a QDD that meets the conditions described below, you must provide on your QDD withholding statement your taxpayer identification number (TIN) issued by the jurisdiction in which you are tax resident identified on line 6, unless you were not issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs). If you do not provide your TIN, you must provide on your QDD withholding statement an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. Do not write “not applicable.” If you are acting as a QDD, you are required to provide your TIN or an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN if:\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are providing this Form W-8IMY to document yourself as an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI); \\n\\n\\nYou receive U.S. source income reportable on a Form 1042-S associated with this form; and\\n\\n\\nThis form is treated as a beneficial owner withholding certificate under Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart IV — Nonqualified Intermediary\\nIf you are providing Form W-8IMY as a nonqualified intermediary (NQI), you must check box 17a. By checking this box, you are certifying to all of the statements on line 17a.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are required to provide a chapter 4 status on line 5 and are acting as an intermediary for a withholdable payment, you must provide your chapter 4 status on line 5 or as otherwise permitted in these instructions to avoid withholding at the chapter 4 rate of 30% being applied to any withholdable payment you receive from the withholding agent regardless of whether you check box 17b (except for documentation provided with respect to exempt beneficial owners).\\nCheck box 17b if you are using this form to transmit withholding certificates or other documentation along with a withholding statement that satisfies the requirements of chapters 3 and 4 (including if you are providing pooled information for purposes of chapter 61 under the alternative procedure for U.S. non-exempt recipients, or chapter 4 withholding rate pools (as applicable) for a withholdable payment).\\nCheck box 17c to certify that you are permitted under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4) to provide a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees to which a payment is allocated on a withholding statement associated with the Form W-8IMY.\\nCheck box 17d to certify that you are acting as a QSL with respect to the accounts identified on this line or in a withholding statement associated with this form with respect to a payment that is a U.S. source substitute dividend.\\nIf you are acting on behalf of another NQI or on behalf of a foreign partnership or foreign trust that is not a withholding foreign partnership or a withholding foreign trust, you must attach to your Form W-8IMY the Form W-8IMY of the other NQI, foreign partnership, or foreign trust together with the withholding certificates and other documentation attached to that Form W-8IMY that are required for both chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes.\\n\\nWithholding statement of an NQI.\\nIf you are an NQI, you must provide a withholding statement and appropriate documentation to obtain reduced rates of withholding for your customers under chapter 3 and chapter 61 and to avoid certain reporting responsibilities. However, see the paragraph later describing an NQI’s withholding statement for chapter 4 purposes for when an NQI may provide a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees without such documentation. The withholding statement must be provided prior to a payment and becomes an integral part of the Form W-8IMY and, therefore, the certification statement that you sign in Part XXIX of the form applies to the withholding statement as well as to the form. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor chapter 4 purposes.\\nIf you are an NQI that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI and you receive a withholdable payment, you must provide a withholding statement which satisfies the requirements of an FFI withholding statement or chapter 4 withholding statement. \\nAn FFI withholding statement may allocate the payment to chapter 4 reporting rate pools (as appropriate), including a chapter 4 withholding rate pool for nonparticipating FFIs, recalcitrant account holders (in each class of account holders described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(6)(i)), or other pool of payees permitted on an FFI withholding statement under the chapter 3 or 4 regulations (see Regulations sections 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B) and 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)), and, for a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), U.S. payees. However, if you are an NQI, you may allocate a portion of a reportable amount (regardless of whether the payment is a withholdable payment) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees when you satisfy the requirements to provide such a pool (including the requirement to certify to your status as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI)). The withholding statement must also identify each intermediary or flow-through entity that is receiving a payment (excluding any intermediary or flow-through entity that is an account holder or interest holder in a QI, WP, or WT), each such entity’s chapter 4 status and GIIN (if applicable), and the chapter 4 withholding rate pools associated with each such entity receiving the payment. \\nA chapter 4 withholding statement must contain the name, address, TIN (if any), entity type, chapter 4 status of each payee, the amount allocated to each payee, and a valid withholding certificate or other documentation sufficient to establish each payee’s chapter 4 status. However, a chapter 4 withholding statement may instead include pooled information for payees that are nonparticipating FFIs or another pool of payees as permitted under the chapter 4 regulations for a chapter 4 withholding statement. The withholding statement must also identify each intermediary or flow-through entity that is receiving a payment (excluding any intermediary or flow-through entity that is an account holder or interest holder in a QI, WP, or WT), each such entity’s chapter 4 status and GIIN (if applicable), and the chapter 4 withholding rate pools associated with each such entity receiving the payment. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA payment that is subject to chapter 3 withholding or that should be subject to chapter 4 withholding should not be included in a U.S. payee pool that is described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(ii). For payments made on or after April 1, 2017, an allocation of a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding to a withholding rate pool of U.S. payees must identify the payees as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2).\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor chapter 3 and chapter 61 purposes.\\nFor chapter 3 and chapter 61 purposes, in the case of a reportable amount that is also a withholdable payment, the withholding statement should allocate only the portion of the payment that was not allocated to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool or a pool described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C) or to a payee identified on the withholding statement to whom withholding was applied under chapter 4. The withholding statement generally must include the following information.\\n\\n\\n\\nInclude the name, address, U.S. TIN (if any), chapter 4 status (for a foreign person receiving a withholdable payment), and the type of documentation (documentary evidence, Form W-9, or type of Form W-8) for every person for whom documentation has been received and state whether that person is a U.S. exempt recipient, a U.S. non-exempt recipient, or a foreign person. The statement must indicate whether a foreign person is a beneficial owner or an intermediary, flow-through entity, U.S. branch, or territory financial institution and the type of recipient, based on the recipient codes shown on Form 1042-S.\\n\\n\\nAllocate each payment by income type to every payee for whom documentation has been provided. The type of income is based on the income codes reported on Form 1042-S (or, if applicable, the income categories for Form 1099). If a payee receives income through another NQI, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch acting as an intermediary, the withholding certificate must also state the name, address, U.S. TIN (if known), and, for a withholdable payment, the chapter 4 status (if required) and GIIN (if applicable) of the other NQI or U.S. branch from which the payee directly receives the payment or the flow-through entity in which the payee has a direct ownership interest. If another NQI, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch fails to allocate a payment, you must provide, for that payment, the name of the NQI, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch that failed to allocate the payment.\\n\\n\\nIf a payee is identified as a foreign person, specify the rate of withholding under chapter 3 to which the payee is subject, the payee’s country of residence and, if a reduced rate of withholding is claimed, the basis for that reduced rate (for example, treaty benefit, portfolio interest, or exemption under section 501(c)(3), 892, or 895). The statement must also include the U.S. or foreign TIN (if required) and, if the beneficial owner is not an individual and is claiming treaty benefits, state whether the limitation on benefits and section 894 statements have been provided by the beneficial owner. You must inform the withholding agent as to which payments those statements relate.\\n\\n\\nInclude any other information the withholding agent requests in order to fulfill its withholding and reporting obligations under chapters 3 and 4 of the Code and/or Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAlternative procedure for NQIs.\\nTo use the alternative procedure you must inform the withholding agent on your withholding statement that you are using the procedure, and the withholding agent must agree to the procedure.\\nUnder this procedure, you must provide a withholding agent with all the information required on the withholding statement and all payee documentation, except the specific allocation information for each payee, prior to the payment of a reportable amount. In addition, you must provide the withholding agent with withholding rate pool information. The withholding statement must assign each payee that is not subject to withholding under chapter 4 to a chapter 3 withholding rate pool prior to the payment of a reportable amount. The withholding rate pool may be established by any reasonable method agreed upon by you and the withholding agent. For example, you may agree to establish a separate account for a single withholding rate pool, or you may agree to divide a payment made to a single account into portions allocable to each withholding rate pool. You must determine withholding rate pools based on valid documentation or, to the extent a payment cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation, the applicable presumption rules. \\nYou must provide the withholding agent with sufficient information to allocate the income in each withholding rate pool to each payee (including U.S. exempt recipients) within the pool no later than January 31 of the year following the year of payment. If you fail to provide allocation information, if required, by January 31 for any withholding rate pool, you may not use this procedure for any payment made after that date for all withholding rate pools. You may remedy your failure to provide allocation information by providing the information to the withholding agent no later than February 14. \\nIn the case of a reportable amount that is also a withholdable payment, you may include amounts allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool (other than a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees) and payees subject to chapter 4 withholding for whom you will provide payee specific information in a 30-percent rate pool together with payees subject to chapter 3 withholding at the 30-percent rate and may not otherwise apply these provisions for payments made to U.S. non-exempt recipients (regardless of whether the payment is a withholdable payment). For the amount of the payment allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees, you may include such an amount in the withholding rate pool that is exempt from withholding (you can include such payees in an exempt pool regardless of whether the payment is a withholdable payment). You must identify prior to the payment each chapter 4 withholding rate pool to be allocated a portion of the payment and must also allocate by January 31 the portion of the payment to each such pool in addition to allocating the payment to each other payee as described in the preceding paragraph. See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(D) for further information on alternative procedures for an NQI.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAlternative withholding statement.\\nIf a withholding agent agrees, instead of providing a withholding statement that contains all of the information described previously, you may provide an alternative withholding statement. You may only use an alternative withholding statement if you are providing the withholding agent with withholding certificates (and not documentary evidence) from the beneficial owners of the payment. The alternative withholding statement is not required to include information that is already on the withholding certificates (including name, address, TIN, chapter 4 status, and GIIN), and you are not required to provide the rate of withholding applicable to each beneficial owner, so long as the withholding agent can determine the appropriate rate based on the withholding certificates. Just as for a nonqualified intermediary withholding statement, the alternative withholding statement must provide information for allocating the payment to each payee and must include any other information the withholding agent needs to fulfill its withholding and reporting obligations. You must also provide a representation on the alternative withholding statement that the information on the withholding certificates is not inconsistent with any other account information you have for the beneficial owner applicable to determining the appropriate rate of withholding. See Regulations section 1.1441-1T(e)(3)(iv)(C)(3).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart V — Territory Financial Institution\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 18\\nCheck box 18a to certify that you are a financial institution (other than an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company) incorporated or organized under the laws of a possession of the United States.\\nYou must also check either box 18b or 18c. Check box 18b to certify that you have agreed to be treated as a U.S. person for purposes of both chapter 3 and chapter 4 with respect to payments associated with this Form W-8IMY. In this case, you will be responsible for chapter 3 withholding and reporting, backup withholding under section 3406, and chapter 4 withholding and reporting for any payments you make to persons for whom you are receiving a reportable amount or withholdable payment. If you check this box 18b, you must provide an EIN on line 8.\\nCheck box 18c to certify that you are a territory financial institution that has not agreed to be treated as a U.S. person. You must certify that you are transmitting withholding certificates or other documentation for persons for whom you are receiving a payment (as required for chapter 3, chapter 61, and section 3406 purposes, and, in the case of a withholdable payment, for chapter 4 withholding and reporting purposes). You must also certify that you have provided or will provide a withholding statement (as required) with the information required on an NQI withholding statement.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA territory entity that is a flow-through entity but is not a territory FI may not complete this Part V and agree to be treated as a U.S. person. Instead, complete Part IV or Part VIII, as appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart VI — Certain U.S. Branches\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLine 19\\nCheck box 19a to certify that you are a U.S. branch described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) receiving income that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.\\nYou must also check either box 19b or 19c. Check box 19b to certify that you are a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or insurance company described in this certification that has agreed with the withholding agent to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to payments associated with this Form W-8IMY. In such case, you will be responsible for chapter 3 withholding and reporting, backup withholding under section 3406, chapter 4 withholding and reporting for any payments you make to persons for whom you are receiving a withholdable payment (including any of your branches treated as NPFFIs), and will be treated as a U.S. payor for chapter 61 purposes. You must provide your EIN on line 8. You do not need to provide a chapter 4 status on line 5 or a GIIN on line 9.\\nCheck box 19c to certify that you are a U.S. branch that does not have an agreement with the withholding agent to be treated as a U.S. person. You must certify that you are transmitting withholding certificates or other documentation for persons for whom you are receiving the payment. You must also certify that you have provided or will provide a withholding statement (as required) with the information required on an NQI withholding statement. For payments made on or after July 1, 2017, also check box 19c to certify that, when you are receiving a withholdable payment associated with this form, you are applying the rules described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C). You must also provide your EIN on line 8 but do not need to include a chapter 4 status in Part I, line 5 or a GIIN on line 9. If you are unable to make this certification, you cannot fill out this part but instead must check the box on line 5 indicating you are a nonparticipating FFI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart VII — Withholding Foreign Partnership (WP) or Withholding Foreign Trust (WT)\\nCheck box 20 if you are a WP or a WT and you are receiving the payment on behalf of your partners, beneficiaries, or owners.\\nIf you are acting as a WP or WT, you must assume primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 for all payments that are made to you for your partners, beneficiaries, or owners. Therefore, you are not required to provide information to the withholding agent regarding each partner’s, beneficiary’s, or owner’s distributive share of the payment and the information for the withholding agent to report under section 1472 (if otherwise required). If you are also receiving payments from the same withholding agent for persons other than your partners, beneficiaries, or owners, you must provide a separate Form W-8IMY for those payments. If you are receiving a withholdable payment, you must provide your chapter 4 status in line 5 and provide your GIIN (if applicable).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart VIII — Nonwithholding Foreign Partnership, Simple Trust, or Grantor Trust\\nCheck box 21a if you are a foreign partnership or a foreign simple or grantor trust that is not a WP or WT. Check box 21b if you are a foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust providing this form for purposes of section 1446. If you are a foreign partnership or grantor trust receiving payments of reportable amounts and providing this form for purposes of section 1446, you may check both boxes. By checking either box, you are certifying to the applicable statements on the form.\\n\\nNote.\\nIf you are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-8ECI (instead of Form W-8IMY). If you are not receiving the income on behalf of your partners, beneficiaries, or owners, do not complete Part VIII. If you are a hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits, provide Form W-8BEN-E. However, if you are receiving a withholdable payment you may also be required to provide this Form W-8IMY and provide your chapter 4 status and the chapter 4 status of each of your owners. See the instructions for Form W-8BEN-E for more information about hybrid entities claiming treaty benefits.\\nIf you are receiving a withholdable payment, you must provide a chapter 4 status in line 5 and provide your GIIN (if applicable) and the information required for the withholding agent to report under section 1472.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWithholding statement of nonwithholding foreign partnership or nonwithholding foreign trust.\\nYou must provide the withholding agent with a withholding statement to obtain reduced rates of withholding and relief from certain reporting obligations. The withholding statement must provide the same information as required for an NQI withholding statement, including the information required with respect to an NQI, foreign partnership, or foreign trust (other than a WP or WT) for which you receive a payment. The withholding statement becomes an integral part of the Form W-8IMY. If you are an FFI and allocate any portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees with respect to accounts that you maintain, you must meet the requirements of Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) and certify to your status in Part I, line 5 as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or reporting Model 2 FFI. By providing a withholding statement making such an allocation with this form, you certify that you meet the requirements outlined for an NQI withholding statement described earlier. \\n\\n\\nForeign partnerships and trusts providing Form W-8IMY for purposes of section 1446.\\nIn general, a partnership is required to withhold under section 1446 on effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) allocable to a foreign partner. A foreign upper-tier partnership (UTP) that is a partner in a lower-tier partnership (LTP) should provide the LTP with a Form W-8IMY and documentation sufficient for the LTP to determine the status of the indirect partner to whom the ECTI is allocable (looking through additional foreign UTPs, if applicable) and to determine such partner’s share of the lower-tier partnership’s ECTI.\\nA foreign grantor trust that is a partner in a partnership should provide Form W-8IMY to the partnership along with documentation and information concerning the grantor or other owner sufficient for the partnership to reliably associate the portion of the trust’s allocable share of ECTI with the grantor or other owner.\\nCheck line 21b to certify that you are a foreign partnership or grantor trust providing this Form W-8IMY to a lower-tier partnership for purposes of section 1446.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are providing this Form W-8IMY solely for purposes of section 1446, you generally are not required to provide a chapter 4 status because items of effectively connected income are not withholdable payments. However, if you do not provide a chapter 4 status and subsequently receive a withholdable payment, you will also be required to provide a Form W-8IMY to provide your chapter 4 status or the lower-tier partnership may have to withhold on the payment.

You must also provide the withholding agent with the specific category of entity described in Annex II of the IGA applicable to your status. In providing the specific category of FFI described in Annex II, you should use the language from Annex II that best and most specifically describes your status in the IGA. For example, indicate \"investment entity wholly owned by exempt beneficial owners\" rather than \"exempt beneficial owner.\" If you are a nonreporting IGA FFI claiming a deemed-compliant status under the regulations, you must instead indicate on this line which section of the regulations you qualify under.\\nIf you are a nonreporting financial institution under an applicable IGA because you qualify as an owner-documented FFI under the regulations, do not check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI.\" Instead you must check \"Owner-documented FFI\" and complete Part XI rather than this Part XIX.\\nSee instructions for line 9 for when a GIIN is required for a nonreporting IGA FFI (including a trustee of a trustee-documented trust that is a foreign person).\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XX — Exempt Retirement Plans\\nYou must check the appropriate box to certify that you satisfy the requirements of exempt retirement plan status.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are not a flow-through entity or acting as an intermediary with respect to the payment for chapter 3 purposes, do not complete Form W-8IMY.

If you are an NFFE that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(i)) as a publicly traded U.S. or foreign entity, you must check box 37b to certify that you are a NFFE affiliate of a publicly traded corporation, provide the name of the publicly traded entity, and identify the securities market on which the stock of the publicly traded entity is traded. See Regulations section 1.1472-1(c)(1)(i) to determine if an entity is publicly traded.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XXV — Excepted Territory NFFE\\nYou must check box 38 to certify that you satisfy the requirements for excepted territory NFFE status. See Regulations section 1.1472-1(c)(1)(iii) for the definition of an excepted territory NFFE.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XXVI — Active NFFE\\nYou must check box 39 to certify that you satisfy the requirements of active NFFE status.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XXVII — Passive NFFE\\nIf you are a passive NFFE, you must check box 40 to certify that you are not a financial institution (other than an investment entity organized in a possession of the United States). You must also certify that you have provided a withholding statement associated with Form W-8IMY to the extent you are required to provide a withholding statement.\\n\\nNote.\\nIf you would be a passive NFFE but for the fact that you are managed by certain types of FFIs (see Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)(4)(i)(B)), you should not complete Part XXVII as you would be considered a financial institution and not a passive NFFE.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XXVIII— Sponsored Direct Reporting NFFE\\nIf you are a sponsored direct reporting NFFE, you must check the box on line 42 to certify that you are not a financial institution and that you satisfy all relevant requirements for this classification. Enter the name of the sponsoring entity in line 41.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPart XXIX — Certification\\nForm W-8IMY must be signed and dated by a person authorized to sign a declaration under penalties of perjury on behalf of the person whose name is on the form. By signing Form W-8IMY the authorized representative, officer, or agent also agrees to provide a new form within 30 days following a change in circumstances (unless no future payments will be made to the intermediary or flow-through entity by the withholding agent and the requestor does not need an updated form for chapter 4 purposes).\\nA withholding agent may allow you to provide this form with an electronic signature. The electronic signature must indicate that the form was electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and a statement that the form has been electronically signed). Simply typing your name into the signature line is not an electronic signature.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSpecial Instructions\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEntities Providing Certifications Under an Applicable IGA (Do Not Complete Line 5)\\nAn FFI in an IGA jurisdiction with which you have an account may provide you with a chapter 4 status certification other than as shown in Parts IX through XXVIII in order to satisfy its due diligence requirements under the applicable IGA. In such a case, you may attach the alternative certification to this Form W-8IMY in lieu of completing a certification otherwise required in Parts IX through XXVIII provided that you: (a) determine that the certification accurately reflects your status for chapter 4 purposes or under an applicable IGA; and (b) the withholding agent provides a written statement to you that it has provided the certification to meet its due diligence requirements as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA. For example, Entity A organized in Country A holds an account with an FFI in Country B. Country B has a Model 1 IGA in effect. The FFI in Country B may ask Entity A to provide a chapter 4 status certification based on the terms of the Country B IGA in order to fulfill its due diligence and documentation requirements under the Country B IGA.\\nYou may also provide with this form an applicable IGA certification if you are determining your chapter 4 status under the definitions provided in an applicable IGA and your certification identifies the jurisdiction that is treated as having an IGA in effect and describes your status as an NFFE or FFI in accordance with the applicable IGA. However, if you determine your status under an applicable IGA as an NFFE, you must still determine if you are an excepted NFFE under the regulations in order to complete this form unless you are provided an alternative certification by an FFI described in the preceding paragraph that covers your certification as an NFFE (such as \"active NFFE\") as defined in an applicable IGA. Additionally, you are required to comply with the conditions of your status under the law of the IGA jurisdiction if you are determining your status under that IGA. If you cannot provide the certifications in Parts IX through XXVIII, do not check a box in line 5. However, if you determine your status under the definitions of the IGA and can certify to a chapter 4 status included on this form, you do not need to provide the certifications described in this paragraph unless required by the FFI to whom you are providing this form.\\nAny certifications provided under an applicable IGA remain subject to the penalties of perjury statement and other certifications made in Part XXIX.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEntities Providing Alternate or Additional Certifications Under Regulations\\nIf you qualify for a status that is not shown on of this form, you may attach applicable certifications for such status from any other Form W-8 on which the relevant certifications appear. If the applicable certifications do not appear on any Form W-8 (if, for example, new regulations provide for an additional status and this form has not been updated) then you may provide an attachment certifying that you qualify for the applicable status described in a particular Regulations section. Include a citation to the applicable provision in the Regulations. Any such attached certification becomes an integral part of this Form W-8IMY and is subject to the penalties of perjury statement and other certifications made in Part XXIX.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions for Form W-8IMY - Notices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nPaperwork Reduction Act Notice.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe ask for the information on this form to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States. You are required to provide the information. We need it to ensure that you are complying with these laws and to allow us to figure and collect the right amount of tax.\\nYou are not required to provide the information requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB control number.

Revised: 01/2020        Instructions for Form 941 - Introductory Material       Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 941 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form941.   \\xa0 What\\'s New  2020 withholding tables. The federal income tax withholding tables are now included in Pub. 15-T, Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods.   Social security and Medicare tax for 2020. The social security tax rate is 6.2% each for the employee and employer, unchanged from 2019. The social security wage base limit is $137,700. The Medicare tax rate is 1.45% each for the employee and employer, unchanged from 2019. There is no wage base limit for Medicare tax. Social security and Medicare taxes apply to the wages of household workers you pay $2,200 or more in cash wages in 2020. Social security and Medicare taxes apply to election workers who are paid $1,900 or more in cash or an equivalent form of compensation in 2020. \\xa0    \\xa0 Reminders  Qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities. For tax years beginning after 2015, a qualified small business may elect to claim up to $250,000 of its credit for increasing research activities as a payroll tax credit against the employer share of social security tax. The payroll tax credit must be elected on an original income tax return that is timely filed (including extensions). The portion of the credit used against the employer share of social security tax is allowed in the first calendar quarter beginning after the date that the qualified small business filed its income tax return. The election and determination of the credit amount that will be used against the employer share of social security tax are made on Form 6765, Credit for Increasing Research Activities. The amount from Form 6765, line 44, must then be reported on Form 8974, Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities. Form 8974 is used to determine the amount of the credit that can be used in the current quarter. The amount from Form 8974, line 12, is reported on Form 941, line 11. If you’re claiming the research payroll tax credit on your Form 941, you must attach Form 8974 to that Form 941. For more information about the payroll tax credit, see Notice 2017-23, 2017-16 I.R.B. 1100, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-16_IRB#NOT-2017-23 and IRS.gov/ResearchPayrollTC. Also see Adjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities reported on line 11, later.   Certification program for professional employer organizations (PEOs). The Stephen Beck, Jr., ABLE Act of 2014 required the IRS to establish a voluntary certification program for PEOs. PEOs handle various payroll administration and tax reporting responsibilities for their business clients and are typically paid a fee based on payroll costs. To become and remain certified under the certification program, certified professional employer organizations (CPEOs) must meet various requirements described in sections 3511 and 7705 and related published guidance. Certification as a CPEO may affect the employment tax liabilities of both the CPEO and its customers. A CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer of any individual who performs services for a customer of the CPEO and is covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between the CPEO and the customer (CPEO contract), but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System. For more information or to apply to become a CPEO, go to IRS.gov/CPEO. CPEOs generally must file Form 941 and Schedule R (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers, electronically. For more information about a CPEO’s requirement to file electronically, see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.   Outsourcing payroll duties. Generally, as an employer, you\\'re responsible to ensure that tax returns are filed and deposits and payments are made, even if you contract with a third party to perform these acts. You remain responsible if the third party fails to perform any required action. Before you choose to outsource any of your payroll and related tax duties (that is, withholding, reporting, and paying over social security, Medicare, FUTA, and income taxes) to a third-party payer, such as a payroll service provider or reporting agent, go to IRS.gov/OutsourcingPayrollDuties for helpful information on this topic. If a CPEO pays wages and other compensation to an individual performing services for you, and the services are covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between you and the CPEO (CPEO contract), then the CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer, but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. However, with respect to certain employees covered by a CPEO contract, you may also be treated as an employer of the employees and, consequently, may also be liable for federal employment taxes imposed on wages and other compensation paid by the CPEO to such employees. For more information on the different types of third-party payer arrangements, see section 16 in Pub. 15.   Aggregate Form 941 filers. Agents and CPEOs must complete Schedule R (Form 941) when filing an aggregate Form 941. Aggregate Forms 941 are filed by agents approved by the IRS under section 3504. To request approval to act as an agent for an employer, the agent files Form 2678 with the IRS unless you\\'re a state or local government agency acting as an agent under the special procedures provided in Rev. Proc. 2013-39, 2013-52 I.R.B. 830, available at IRS.gov/irb/2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39. Aggregate Forms 941 are also filed by CPEOs approved by the IRS under section 7705. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System at IRS.gov/CPEO. CPEOs file Form 8973, Certified Professional Employer Organization/Customer Reporting Agreement, to notify the IRS that they started or ended a service contract with a customer. CPEOs generally must file Form 941 and Schedule R electronically. For more information about a CPEO’s requirement to file electronically, see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.   \\xa0 If both an employer and a section 3504 authorized agent paid wages to an employee during a quarter, or if both an employer and a CPEO paid wages to an employee during a quarter, both the employer and the section 3504 authorized agent (or the CPEO, if applicable) should file Form 941 reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the applicable quarter and issue Forms W-2 reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the year.  Work opportunity tax credit for qualified tax-exempt organizations hiring qualified veterans. Qualified tax-exempt organizations that hire eligible unemployed veterans may be able to claim the work opportunity tax credit against their payroll tax liability using Form 5884-C. For more information, go to IRS.gov/WOTC.   COBRA premium assistance credit. Effective for tax periods beginning after 2013, the credit for COBRA premium assistance payments can\\'t be claimed on Form 941. Instead, after filing your Form 941, file Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit. Filing a Form 941-X before filing a Form 941 for the quarter may result in errors or delays in processing your Form 941-X. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 941-X.   \\xa0 If you’re entitled to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit, but aren\\'t otherwise required to file Form 941, file a Form 941 with -0- entered on line 14 before filing a Form 941-X to claim the credit.   Correcting a previously filed Form 941. If you discover an error on a previously filed Form 941, make the correction using Form 941-X. Form 941-X is filed separately from Form 941. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 941-X, section 13 of Pub. 15, or go to IRS.gov/CorrectingEmploymentTaxes.   Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT). You must use EFT to make all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). If you don\\'t want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your behalf. Also, you may arrange for your financial institution to initiate a same-day wire payment on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of the Treasury. Services provided by your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other third party may have a fee. For more information on making federal tax deposits, see section 11 of Pub. 15. To get more information about EFTPS or to enroll in EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov, or call 800-555-4477 or 800-733-4829 (TDD). Additional information about EFTPS is also available in Pub. 966.  \\xa0 For an EFTPS deposit to be on time, you must submit the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date the deposit is due.  \\xa0 Same-day wire payment option. If you fail to submit a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Collection Service (FTCS) to make a same-day wire payment. To use the same-day wire payment method, you will need to make arrangements with your financial institution ahead of time. Please check with your financial institution regarding availability, deadlines, and costs. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for payments made this way. To learn more about the information you will need to give your financial institution to make a same-day wire payment, go to IRS.gov/SameDayWire.   \\xa0 Timeliness of federal tax deposits. If a deposit is required to be made on a day that isn\\'t a business day, the deposit is considered timely if it is made by the close of the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The term \"legal holiday\" for deposit purposes includes only those legal holidays in the District of Columbia. Legal holidays in the District of Columbia are provided in section 11 of Pub. 15.    Electronic filing and payment. Businesses can enjoy the benefits of filing tax returns and paying their federal taxes electronically. Whether you rely on a tax professional or handle your own taxes, the IRS offers you convenient programs to make filing and paying easier. Spend less time worrying about taxes and more time running your business. Use e-file and EFTPS to your benefit.    For e-file, go to IRS.gov/EmploymentEfile for additional information. A fee may be charged to file electronically.   For EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov, or call EFTPS Customer Service at 800-555-4477 or 800-733-4829 (TDD) for additional information.   For electronic filing of Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, go to SSA.gov/employer. You may be required to file Forms W-2 electronically. For details, see the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3.    \\xa0  \\xa0 If you’re filing your tax return or paying your federal taxes electronically, a valid employer identification number (EIN) is required at the time the return is filed or the payment is made. If a valid EIN isn\\'t provided, the return or payment won\\'t be processed. This may result in penalties. See Employer identification number (EIN), later, for information about applying for an EIN.  \\xa0 Electronic funds withdrawal (EFW). If you file Form 941 electronically, you can e-file and use EFW to pay the balance due in a single step using tax preparation software or through a tax professional. However, don\\'t use EFW to make federal tax deposits. For more information on paying your taxes using EFW, go to IRS.gov/EFW.     Credit or debit card payments. You can pay the balance due shown on Form 941 by credit or debit card. Your payment will be processed by a payment processor who will charge a processing fee. Don\\'t use a credit or debit card to make federal tax deposits. For more information on paying your taxes with a credit or debit card, go to IRS.gov/PayByCard.    Online payment agreement. You may be eligible to apply for an installment agreement online if you can\\'t pay the full amount of tax you owe when you file your return. For more information, see What if you can\\'t pay in full, later.   Paid preparers. If you use a paid preparer to complete Form 941, the paid preparer must complete and sign the paid preparer\\'s section of the form.   Where can you get telephone help? For answers to your questions about completing Form 941 or tax deposit rules, you can call the IRS at 800-829-4933 or 800-829-4059 (TDD/TTY for persons who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability), Monday–Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. local time (Alaska and Hawaii follow Pacific time).   Photographs of missing children. The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in instructions on pages that would otherwise be blank.

General Instructions:    \\xa0 Purpose of Form 941 These instructions give you some background information about Form 941. They tell you who must file Form 941, how to complete it line by line, and when and where to file it. If you want more in-depth information about payroll tax topics relating to Form 941, see Pub. 15 or go to IRS.gov/EmploymentTaxes. Federal law requires you, as an employer, to withhold certain taxes from your employees\\' pay. Each time you pay wages, you must withhold—or take out of your employees\\' pay—certain amounts for federal income tax, social security tax, and Medicare tax. You must also withhold Additional Medicare Tax from wages you pay to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. Under the withholding system, taxes withheld from your employees are credited to your employees in payment of their tax liabilities. Federal law also requires you to pay any liability for the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes. This share of social security and Medicare taxes isn\\'t withheld from employees.   \\xa0 Who Must File Form 941? If you pay wages subject to federal income tax withholding or social security and Medicare taxes, you must file Form 941 quarterly to report the following amounts.    Wages you’ve paid.   Tips your employees reported to you.   Federal income tax you withheld.   Both the employer and the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes.   Additional Medicare Tax withheld from employees.   Current quarter\\'s adjustments to social security and Medicare taxes for fractions of cents, sick pay, tips, and group-term life insurance.   Qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities.    \\xa0 Don\\'t use Form 941 to report backup withholding or income tax withholding on nonpayroll payments such as pensions, annuities, and gambling winnings. Report these types of withholding on Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax. Also, don\\'t use Form 941 to report unemployment taxes. Report unemployment taxes on Form 940, Employer\\'s Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return. After you file your first Form 941, you must file a return for each quarter, even if you have no taxes to report, unless you filed a final return or one of the exceptions listed next applies.  \\xa0 Exceptions Special rules apply to some employers.    If you received notification to file Form 944, you must file Form 944 annually; don\\'t file Form 941 quarterly.   Seasonal employers don\\'t have to file a Form 941 for quarters in which they have no tax liability because they have paid no wages. To tell the IRS that you won\\'t file a return for one or more quarters during the year, check the box on line 18 every quarter you file Form 941. See section 12 of Pub. 15 for more information.   Employers of household employees don\\'t usually file Form 941. See Pub. 926 and Schedule H (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for more information.   Employers of farm employees don\\'t file Form 941 for wages paid for agricultural labor. See Form 943 and Pub. 51 for more information.    \\xa0  \\xa0 If none of the above exceptions applies and you haven\\'t filed a final return, you must file Form 941 each quarter even if you didn\\'t pay wages during the quarter. Use IRS e-file, if possible.   \\xa0 Requesting To File Forms 941 Instead of Form 944, or Requesting To File Form 944 Instead of Forms 941  Requesting to file Forms 941 instead of Form 944.

If you sell or transfer your business during the quarter, you and the new owner must each file a Form 941 for the quarter in which the transfer occurred. Report only the wages you paid. When two businesses merge, the continuing firm must file a return for the quarter in which the change took place and the other firm should file a final return. Changing from one form of business to another—such as from a sole proprietorship to a partnership or corporation—is considered a transfer. If a transfer occurs, you may need a new EIN. See Pub. 1635 and section 1 of Pub. 15 for more information. Attach a statement to your return with:    The new owner\\'s name (or the new name of the business);   Whether the business is now a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation;   The kind of change that occurred (a sale or transfer);   The date of the change; and   The name of the person keeping the payroll records and the address where those records will be kept.    \\xa0   \\xa0    If Your Business Has Closed . . .    If you go out of business or stop paying wages to your employees, you must file a final return. To tell the IRS that Form 941 for a particular quarter is your final return, check the box on line 17 and enter the final date you paid wages. Also attach a statement to your return showing the name of the person keeping the payroll records and the address where those records will be kept. See Terminating a business in the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for information about earlier dates for the expedited furnishing and filing of Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, when a final Form 941 is filed. If you participated in a statutory merger or consolidation, or qualify for predecessor-successor status due to an acquisition, you should generally file Schedule D (Form 941), Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations. See the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) to determine whether you should file Schedule D (Form 941) and when you should file it.     \\xa0 When Must You File? File your initial Form 941 for the quarter in which you first paid wages that are subject to social security and Medicare taxes or subject to federal income tax withholding. See the table titled When To File Form 941, later. Then you must file for every quarter after that—every 3 months—even if you have no taxes to report, unless you’re a seasonal employer or are filing your final return. See Seasonal employers and If Your Business Has Closed, earlier. File Form 941 only once for each quarter. If you filed electronically, don\\'t file a paper Form 941. For more information about filing Form 941 electronically, see Electronic filing and payment, earlier.  When To File Form 941          Your Form 941 is due by the last day of the month that follows the end of the quarter.   The Quarter Includes . . . Quarter Ends Form 941 \\t\\t\\tIs Due   1. January, February, March March 31 April 30   2. April, May, June June 30 July 31   3. July, August, September September 30 October 31   4. October, November, December December 31 January 31      \\xa0 For example, you generally must report wages you pay during the first quarter—which is January through March—by April 30. If you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the quarter, you may file by the 10th day of the second month that follows the end of the quarter. For example, you may file Form 941 by May 10 if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the first quarter. If we receive Form 941 after the due date, we will treat Form 941 as filed on time if the envelope containing Form 941 is properly addressed, contains sufficient postage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the due date, or sent by an IRS-designated private delivery service (PDS) on or before the due date. If you don\\'t follow these guidelines, we generally will consider Form 941 filed when it is actually received. For more information about PDSs, see Where Should You File, later. If any due date for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file your return on the next business day.   \\xa0 How Should You Complete Form 941? Type or print your EIN, name, and address in the spaces provided. Also enter your name and EIN on the top of page 2. Don\\'t use your social security number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Generally, enter the business (legal) name you used when you applied for your EIN. For example, if you’re a sole proprietor, enter \"Haleigh Smith\" on the \"Name\" line and \"Haleigh\\'s Cycles\" on the \"Trade name\" line. Leave the \"Trade name\" line blank if it is the same as your \"Name.\" If you use a tax preparer to fill out Form 941, make sure the preparer shows your business name exactly as it appeared when you applied for your EIN.  Employer identification number (EIN). To make sure businesses comply with federal tax laws, the IRS monitors tax filings and payments by using a numerical system to identify taxpayers. A unique nine-digit EIN is assigned to all corporations, partnerships, and some sole proprietors. Businesses needing an EIN must apply for a number and use it throughout the life of the business on all tax returns, payments, and reports. Your business should have only one EIN. If you have more than one and aren\\'t sure which one to use, write to the IRS office where you file your returns (using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, later) or call the IRS at 800-829-4933. If you don\\'t have an EIN, you may apply for one online by visiting IRS.gov/EIN. You may also apply for an EIN by faxing or mailing Form SS-4 to the IRS. If the principal business was created or organized outside of the United States or U.S. territories, you may also apply for an EIN by calling 267-941-1099 (toll call). If you haven\\'t received your EIN by the due date of Form 941, file a paper return and write \"Applied For\" and the date you applied in this entry space.  \\xa0 If you’re filing your tax return electronically, a valid EIN is required at the time the return is filed. If a valid EIN isn\\'t provided, the return won\\'t be accepted. This may result in penalties.  \\xa0 Always be sure the EIN on the form you file exactly matches the EIN the IRS assigned to your business. Don\\'t use your SSN or ITIN on forms that ask for an EIN. Filing a Form 941 with an incorrect EIN or using another business\\'s EIN may result in penalties and delays in processing your return.   If you change your business name, business address, or responsible party... Notify the IRS immediately if you change your business name, business address, or responsible party.    Write to the IRS office where you file your returns (using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, later) to notify the IRS of any business name change. See Pub.1635 to see if you need to apply for a new EIN.   Complete and mail Form 8822-B to notify the IRS of a business address or responsible party change. Don\\'t mail Form 8822-B with your Form 941. For a definition of \"responsible party,\" see the Instructions for Form SS-4.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Check the Box for the Quarter Under \"Report for this Quarter of 2020\" at the top of Form 941, check the appropriate box of the quarter for which you’re filing. Make sure the quarter checked is the same as shown on any attached Schedule B (Form 941), Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule Depositors, or Schedule R (Form 941).   \\xa0 Completing and Filing Form 941 Make entries on Form 941 as follows to enable accurate scanning and processing.    Use 10-point Courier font (if possible) for all entries if you’re typing or using a computer to complete your form. Portable Document Format (PDF) forms on IRS.gov have fillable fields with acceptable font specifications.   Don\\'t enter dollar signs and decimal points. Commas are optional. Enter dollars to the left of the preprinted decimal point and cents to the right of it. Don’t round entries to whole dollars. Always show an amount for cents, even if it is zero.   Leave blank any data field (except lines 1, 2, and 12) with a value of zero.   Enter negative amounts using a minus sign (if possible). Otherwise, use parentheses.   Enter your name and EIN on all pages.   Enter your name, EIN, \"Form 941,\" and the tax year and quarter on all attachments.   Staple multiple sheets in the upper left corner when filing.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Required Notice to Employees About the Earned Income Credit (EIC) To notify employees about the EIC, you must give the employees one of the following items.    Form W-2 which has the required information about the EIC on the back of Copy B.   A substitute Form W-2 with the same EIC information on the back of the employee\\'s copy that is on Copy B of the IRS Form W-2.   Notice 797, Possible Federal Tax Refund Due to the Earned Income Credit (EIC).   Your written statement with the same wording as \\tNotice 797.    \\xa0 For more information, see section 10 of Pub. 15, Pub. 596, and IRS.gov/EIC.   \\xa0 Reconciling Forms 941 and Form W-3 The IRS matches amounts reported on your four quarterly Forms 941 with Form W-2 amounts totaled on your yearly Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements. If the amounts don\\'t agree, you may be contacted by the IRS or the Social Security Administration (SSA). The following amounts are reconciled.    Federal income tax withholding.   Social security wages.   Social security tips.   Medicare wages and tips.    \\xa0 For more information, see section 12 of Pub. 15 and the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941).    \\xa0 Where Should You File?

Don\\'t send Form 941 or any payments to the SSA.   \\xa0 Depositing Your Taxes  \\xa0 You must deposit all depository taxes electronically by EFT. For more information, see Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) under Reminders, earlier.  \\xa0 Must You Deposit Your Taxes? You may have to deposit the federal income taxes you withheld and both the employer and employee social security taxes and Medicare taxes.    If your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) are less than $2,500 for the current quarter or the prior quarter, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. You don\\'t have to make a deposit. To avoid a penalty, you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely. For more information on paying with a timely filed return, see the instructions for line 14, later. If you’re not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $2,500 (and your liability for the prior quarter wasn\\'t less than $2,500), make deposits using the semiweekly or monthly rules so you won\\'t be subject to failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalties.   If your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) are $2,500 or more for the current quarter and the prior quarter. You must make deposits according to your deposit schedule. See section 11 of Pub. 15 for information about payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule and for rules about federal tax deposits.    \\xa0 You may reduce your deposits during the quarter by the amount of the COBRA premium assistance credit that will be reflected on your Form 941-X, but only if you use the claim process and not the adjustment process to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit on your Form 941-X for the quarter. The COBRA premium assistance credit is treated as a credit on the first day of the return period (that is, January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). However, because the credit is now claimed on Form 941-X filed after submission of the Form 941, an employer that reduces its required deposits in anticipation of the credit will receive a system-generated notice reflecting a balance due and associated penalties and interest, if applicable. The balance due, including any related penalties and interest, resulting from the reduction in deposits in anticipation of the credit will be abated when the credit is applied. Such abatement will generally occur without any further action from the employer. Alternatively, to prevent triggering a system-generated balance due notice, the employer can make its deposits without a reduction in anticipation of the COBRA premium assistance credit and follow the ordinary procedures for filing a claim for refund or adjusted return using Form 941-X.   \\xa0 When Must You Deposit Your Taxes?  \\xa0    Determine if You’re a Monthly or Semiweekly Schedule Depositor for the Quarter    The IRS uses two different sets of deposit rules to determine when businesses must deposit their social security, Medicare, and withheld federal income taxes. These schedules tell you when a deposit is due after you have a payday. Your deposit schedule isn\\'t determined by how often you pay your employees. Your deposit schedule depends on the total tax liability you reported on Form 941 during the previous 4-quarter lookback period (July 1 of the second preceding calendar year through June 30 of the preceding calendar year). See section 11 of Pub. 15 for details. If you filed Form 944 in either 2018 or 2019, your lookback period is the 2018 calendar year. Before the beginning of each calendar year, determine which type of deposit schedule you must use.    If you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor.   If you reported more than $50,000 of taxes during the lookback period, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.    \\xa0  \\xa0 If you’re a monthly schedule depositor and accumulate a $100,000 tax liability on any day during the deposit period, you become a semiweekly schedule depositor on the next day and remain so for at least the rest of the calendar year and for the following calendar year. See $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule in section 11 of Pub. 15 for more information.     \\xa0 What About Penalties and Interest?  \\xa0 Avoiding Penalties and Interest You can avoid paying penalties and interest if you do all of the following.    Deposit or pay your taxes when they are due.   File your fully completed Form 941 on time.   Report your tax liability accurately.   Submit valid checks for tax payments.   Furnish accurate Forms W-2 to employees.   File Form W-3 and Copy A of Forms W-2 with the SSA on time and accurately.    \\xa0 Penalties and interest are charged on taxes paid late and returns filed late at a rate set by law. See sections 11 and 12 of Pub. 15 for details. Use Form 843 to request abatement of assessed penalties or interest. Don\\'t request abatement of assessed penalties or interest on Form 941 or Form 941-X. If you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don\\'t attach an explanation when you file your return.  \\xa0 If federal income, social security, and Medicare taxes that must be withheld (that is, trust fund taxes) aren\\'t withheld or aren\\'t deposited or paid to the United States Treasury, the trust fund recovery penalty may apply. The penalty is 100% of the unpaid trust fund tax. If these unpaid taxes can\\'t be immediately collected from the employer or business, the trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to be responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. For more information, see section 11 of Pub. 15.    \\xa0 Adjustment of Tax on Tips If, by the 10th of the month after the month you received an employee\\'s report on tips, you don\\'t have enough employee funds available to withhold the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes, you no longer have to collect it. Report the entire amount of these tips on line 5b (Taxable social security tips), line 5c (Taxable Medicare wages and tips), and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 5d (Taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding). Include as a negative adjustment on line 9 the total uncollected employee share of the social security and Medicare taxes.      Specific Instructions:    \\xa0 Part 1: Answer These Questions for This Quarter  \\xa0 1. Number of Employees Who Received Wages, Tips, or Other Compensation Enter the number of employees on your payroll for the pay period including March 12, June 12, September 12, or December 12, for the quarter indicated at the top of Form 941.

If you’re a third-party payer of sick pay, don\\'t include sick pay that you paid to policyholders\\' employees here if you gave the policyholders timely notice of the payments. See section 6 of Pub. 15-A, Employer\\'s Supplemental Tax Guide, for more information about sick pay reporting and the procedures for transferring the liability to the employer.   \\xa0 3. Federal Income Tax Withheld From Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation Enter the federal income tax you withheld (or were required to withhold) from your employees on this quarter\\'s wages, tips, taxable fringe benefits, and supplemental unemployment compensation benefits. Don\\'t include any income tax withheld by a third-party payer of sick pay even if you reported it on Forms W-2. You will reconcile this difference on Form W-3. Also include here any excise taxes you were required to withhold on golden parachute payments (section 4999). For information on the employment tax treatment of fringe benefits, see Pub. 15-B, Employer\\'s Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits. For information about supplemental unemployment compensation benefits and golden parachute payments, see section 5 of Pub. 15-A. If you’re a third-party payer of sick pay, enter the federal income tax you withheld (or were required to withhold) on third-party sick pay here.   \\xa0 4. If No Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation Are Subject to Social Security or Medicare Tax . . . If no wages, tips, and other compensation on line 2 are subject to social security or Medicare tax, check the box on line 4. If this question doesn\\'t apply to you, leave the box blank. For more information about exempt wages, see section 15 of Pub. 15. For religious exemptions, see section 4 of Pub. 15-A.  \\xa0 If you’re a government employer, wages you pay aren\\'t automatically exempt from social security and Medicare taxes. Your employees may be covered by law or by a voluntary Section 218 Agreement with the SSA. For more information, see Pub. 963, Federal-State Reference Guide.   \\xa0 5a–5e. Taxable Social Security and Medicare Wages and Tips  \\xa0 5a. Taxable social security wages. Enter the total wages, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits subject to social security taxes you paid to your employees during the quarter. For this purpose, sick pay includes payments made by an insurance company to your employees for which you received timely notice from the insurance company. See section 6 in Pub. 15-A for more information about sick pay reporting. Enter the amount before payroll deductions. Don\\'t include tips on this line. For information on types of wages subject to social security taxes, see section 5 of Pub. 15. For 2020, the rate of social security tax on taxable wages is 6.2% (0.062) each for the employer and employee or 12.4% (0.124) for both. Stop paying social security tax on and entering an employee\\'s wages on line 5a when the employee\\'s taxable wages (including tips) reach $137,700 for the year. However, continue to withhold income and Medicare taxes for the whole year on wages and tips even when the social security wage base of $137,700 has been reached. \\xa0           line 5a (column 1)   x 0.124 \\xa0   line 5a (column 2)     \\xa0   \\xa0 5b. Taxable social security tips. Enter all tips your employees reported to you during the quarter until the total of the tips and wages for an employee reach $137,700 for the year. Include all tips your employee reported to you even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 6.2%. You will reduce your total taxes by the amount of any uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on tips later on line 9; see Current quarter\\'s adjustments for tips and group-term life insurance, later. Don’t include service charges on line 5b. For details about the difference between tips and service charges, see Rev. Rul. 2012-18, 2012-26 I.R.B. 1032, available at IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18. Your employee must report cash tips to you by the 10th day of the month after the month the tips are received. Cash tips include tips paid by cash, check, debit card, and credit card. The report should include charged tips (for example, credit and debit card charges) you paid over to the employee for charge customers, tips the employee received directly from customers, and tips received from other employees under any tip-sharing arrangement. Both directly and indirectly tipped employees must report tips to you. No report is required for months when tips are less than $20. Employees may use Form 4070 (available only in Pub. 1244), or submit a written statement or electronic tip record. Don\\'t include allocated tips (described in section 6 of Pub. 15) on this line. Instead, report them on Form 8027.

Taxable Medicare wages & tips. Enter all wages, tips, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits that are subject to Medicare tax. Unlike social security wages, there is no limit on the amount of wages subject to Medicare tax. The rate of Medicare tax is 1.45% (0.0145) each for the employer and employee or 2.9% (0.029) for both. Include all tips your employees reported during the quarter, even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 1.45%. \\xa0           line 5c (column 1)   x 0.029 \\xa0   line 5c (column 2)     \\xa0 For more information on tips, see section 6 of Pub. 15.   \\xa0 5d. Taxable wages & tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding. Enter all wages, tips, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits that are subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding. You’re required to begin withholding Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which you pay wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. Additional Medicare Tax is only imposed on the employee. There is no employer share of Additional Medicare Tax. All wages that are subject to Medicare tax are subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding if paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold. For more information on what wages are subject to Medicare tax, see the chart, Special Rules for Various Types of Services and Payments, in section 15 of Pub. 15. For more information on Additional Medicare Tax, go to IRS.gov/ADMT. Once wages and tips exceed the $200,000 withholding threshold, include all tips your employees reported during the quarter, even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 0.9%. \\xa0           line 5d (column 1)   x 0.009 \\xa0   line 5d (column 2)     \\xa0   \\xa0 5e. Total social security and Medicare taxes. Add the column 2 amounts on lines 5a–5d. Enter the result on line 5e.    \\xa0 5f. Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand—Tax Due on Unreported Tips Enter the tax due from your Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand on line 5f. The IRS issues a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand to advise an employer of the amount of tips received by employees who failed to report or underreported tips to the employer. An employer isn\\'t liable for the employer share of the social security and Medicare taxes on unreported tips until notice and demand for the taxes is made to the employer by the IRS in a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand. The tax due may have been determined from tips reported to the IRS on employees\\' Forms 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income, or other tips that weren\\'t reported to their employer as determined by the IRS during an examination. For additional information, see Rev. Rul. 2012-18, 2012-26 I.R.B. 1032, available at IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18. Deposit the tax within the time period required under your deposit schedule to avoid any possible deposit penalty. The tax is treated as accumulated by the employer on the \"Date of Notice and Demand\" as printed on the Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand. The employer must include this amount on the appropriate line of the record of federal tax liability (Part 2 of Form 941 for a monthly schedule depositor or Schedule B (Form 941) for a semiweekly schedule depositor).   \\xa0 6. Total Taxes Before Adjustments Add the total federal income tax withheld from wages, tips, and other compensation (line 3), the total social security and Medicare taxes before adjustments (line 5e), and any tax due under a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand (line 5f). Enter the result on line 6.   \\xa0 7–9. Tax Adjustments Enter tax amounts on lines 7–9 that result from current quarter adjustments. Use a minus sign (if possible) to show an adjustment that decreases the total taxes shown on line 6 instead of parentheses. Doing so enhances the accuracy of our scanning software. For example, enter \"-10.59\" instead of \"(10.59).\" However, if your software only allows for parentheses in entering negative amounts, you may use them.  Current quarter\\'s adjustments. In certain cases, you must adjust the amounts you entered as social security and Medicare taxes in column 2 of lines 5a–5d to figure your correct tax liability for this quarter\\'s Form 941. See section 13 of Pub. 15.   \\xa0 7. Current quarter\\'s adjustment for fractions of cents. Enter adjustments for fractions of cents (due to rounding) relating to the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes withheld. The employee share of amounts shown in column 2 of lines 5a–5d may differ slightly from amounts actually withheld from employees\\' pay due to the rounding of social security and Medicare taxes based on statutory rates. This adjustment may be a positive or a negative adjustment.   \\xa0 8. Current quarter\\'s adjustment for sick pay. Enter a negative adjustment for the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes that were withheld and deposited by your third-party sick pay payer with regard to sick pay paid by the third party. These wages should be included on line 5a, line 5c, and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 5d. If you’re the third-party sick pay payer, enter a negative adjustment for any employer share of these taxes required to be paid by the employer.   \\xa0 9. Current quarter\\'s adjustments for tips and group-term life insurance. Enter a negative adjustment for:    Any uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on tips, and   The uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on group-term life insurance premiums paid for former employees.    \\xa0   Prior quarter\\'s adjustments. If you need to correct any adjustment reported on a previously filed Form 941, complete and file Form 941-X. Form 941-X is an adjusted return or claim for refund and is filed separately from Form 941. See section 13 of Pub. 15.    \\xa0 10. Total Taxes After Adjustments Combine the amounts shown on lines 6–9 and enter the result on line 10.   \\xa0 11. Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities Enter the amount of the credit from Form 8974, line 12.  \\xa0 If you enter an amount on line 11, you must attach Form 8974.   \\xa0 12. Total Taxes After Adjustments and Credits Subtract line 11 from line 10 and enter the result on line 12. \\xa0    If line 12 is less than $2,500 or line 12 on the prior quarterly return was less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. You may pay the amount with Form 941 or you may deposit the amount. To avoid a penalty, you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely. For more information on paying with a timely filed return, see the instructions for line 14, later.   If line 12 is $2,500 or more and line 12 on the prior quarterly return was $2,500 or more, or if you incurred a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. You must make deposits according to your deposit schedule. The amount shown on line 12 must equal the \"Total liability for quarter\" shown on line 16 or the \"Total liability for the quarter\" shown on Schedule B (Form 941).    \\xa0 For more information and rules about federal tax deposits, see Depositing Your Taxes, earlier, and section 11 of Pub. 15.  \\xa0 If you’re a semiweekly depositor, you must complete Schedule B (Form 941). If you fail to complete and submit Schedule B (Form 941), the IRS may assert deposit penalties based on available information.   \\xa0 13. Total Deposits for This Quarter Enter your deposits for this quarter, including any overpayment from a prior quarter that you applied to this return. Also include in the amount shown any overpayment that you applied from filing Form 941-X, 941-X (PR), 944-X, or 944-X (SP) in the current quarter.   \\xa0 14. Balance Due If line 12 is more than line 13, enter the difference on line 14. Otherwise, see Overpayment, later. Never make an entry on both lines 14 and 15. You don\\'t have to pay if line 14 is under $1. Generally, you should have a balance due only if your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) for the current quarter or prior quarter are less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. However, see section 11 of Pub. 15 for information about payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule. If you were required to make federal tax deposits, pay the amount shown on line 14 by EFT. If you weren\\'t required to make federal tax deposits (see Must You Deposit Your Taxes, earlier) or you\\'re a monthly schedule depositor making a payment under the accuracy of deposits rule, you may pay the amount shown on line 14 by EFT, credit card, debit card, check, money order, or EFW. For more information on electronic payment options, go to IRS.gov/Payments. If you pay by EFT, credit card, or debit card, file your return using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, earlier, and don\\'t file Form 941-V, Payment Voucher. If you pay by check or money order, make it payable to \"United States Treasury.\" Enter your EIN, \"Form 941,\" and the tax period (\"1st Quarter 2020,\" \"2nd Quarter 2020,\" \"3rd Quarter 2020,\" or \"4th Quarter 2020\") on your check or money order. Complete Form 941-V and enclose with Form 941. If line 12 is $2,500 or more on both your prior and current quarter Form 941, and you’ve deposited all taxes when due, the balance due on line 14 should be zero, unless you’ve reduced your deposits in anticipation of filing a Form 941-X to claim COBRA premium assistance credits. See Depositing Your Taxes, earlier.  \\xa0 If you’re required to make deposits and instead pay the taxes with Form 941, you may be subject to a penalty. See Must You Deposit Your Taxes, earlier.   \\xa0 What if you can\\'t pay in full? If you can\\'t pay the full amount of tax you owe, you can apply for an installment agreement online. You can apply for an installment agreement online if:    You can\\'t pay the full amount shown on line 14,   The total amount you owe is $25,000 or less, and   You can pay the liability in full in 24 months.    \\xa0 To apply using the Online Payment Agreement Application, go to IRS.gov/OPA. Under an installment agreement, you can pay what you owe in monthly installments. There are certain conditions you must meet to enter into and maintain an installment agreement, such as paying the liability within 24 months, and making all required deposits and timely filing tax returns during the length of the agreement. If your installment agreement is accepted, you will be charged a fee and you will be subject to penalties and interest on the amount of tax not paid by the due date of the return.   \\xa0 15. Overpayment If line 13 is more than line 12, enter the difference on line 15. Never make an entry on both lines 14 and 15. If you deposited more than the correct amount for the quarter, you can choose to have the IRS either refund the overpayment or apply it to your next return. Check only one box on line 15. If you don\\'t check either box or if you check both boxes, generally we will apply the overpayment to your next return. Regardless of any boxes you check or don\\'t check on line 15, we may apply your overpayment to any past due tax account that is shown in our records under your EIN. If line 15 is under $1, we will send a refund or apply it to your next return only if you ask us in writing to do so.   \\xa0 Complete Both Pages You must complete both pages of Form 941 and sign on page 2. Failure to do so may delay processing of your return.    \\xa0 Part 2: Tell Us About Your Deposit Schedule and Tax Liability for This Quarter  \\xa0 16. Tax Liability for the Quarter Check one of the boxes on line 16. Follow the instructions for each box to determine if you need to enter your monthly tax liability on Form 941 or your daily tax liability on Schedule B (Form 941).  De minimis exception. If line 12 is less than $2,500 or line 12 on the prior quarterly return was less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter, check the first box on line 16 and go to Part 3.  \\xa0 If you meet the de minimis exception based on the prior quarter and line 12 for the current quarter is $100,000 or more, you must provide a record of your federal tax liability. If you’re a monthly schedule depositor, complete the deposit schedule on line 16. If you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, attach Schedule B (Form 941).   Monthly schedule depositor. If you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule discussed in section 11 of Pub. 15 applies. Check the second box on line 16 and enter your tax liability for each month in the quarter. Enter your tax liabilities in the month that corresponds to the dates you paid wages to your employees, not the date payroll liabilities were accrued or deposits were made. Add the amounts for each month. Enter the result in the \"Total liability for quarter\" box. Note that your total tax liability for the quarter must equal your total taxes shown on line 12. If it doesn\\'t, your tax deposits and payments may not be counted as timely. Don\\'t change your tax liability on line 16 by adjustments reported on any Forms 941-X. You’re a monthly schedule depositor for the calendar year if the amount of your Form 941 taxes reported for the lookback period is $50,000 or less. The lookback period is the 4 consecutive quarters ending on June 30 of the prior year. For 2020, the lookback period begins July 1, 2018, and ends June 30, 2019. For details on the deposit rules, see section 11 of Pub. 15. If you filed Form 944 in either 2018 or 2019, your lookback period is the 2018 calendar year.  \\xa0 The amounts entered on line 16 are a summary of your monthly tax liability, not a summary of deposits you made. If you don\\'t properly report your liabilities when required or if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor and enter your liabilities on line 16 instead of on Schedule B (Form 941), you may be assessed an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. See Deposit Penalties in section 11 of Pub. 15 for more information.  \\xa0 Reporting adjustments from lines 7–9 on line 16. If your net adjustment during a month is negative and it exceeds your total tax liability for the month, don\\'t enter a negative amount for the month. Instead, enter \"-0-\" for the month and carry over the unused portion of the adjustment to the next month.     Semiweekly schedule depositor. If you reported more than $50,000 of taxes for the lookback period, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor. Check the third box on line 16. You must complete Schedule B (Form 941) and submit it with your Form 941. Don\\'t file Schedule B (Form 941) with your Form 941 if you’re a monthly schedule depositor. Don\\'t change your tax liability on Schedule B (Form 941) by adjustments reported on any Forms 941-X.   Adjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities reported on line 11. Monthly schedule depositors and semiweekly schedule depositors must account for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities (line 11) when reporting their tax liabilities on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941). The total tax liability for the quarter must equal the amount reported on line 12. Failure to account for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941) may cause line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941) to report more than the total tax liability reported on line 12. The qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities applies to the employer share of social security tax on wages paid in the quarter that begins after the income tax return electing the credit has been filed. In completing line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941), you take into account the payroll tax credit against the liability for the employer share of social security tax starting with the first payroll payment of the quarter that includes payments of wages subject to social security tax to your employees. The credit may be taken to the extent of the employer share of social security tax on wages associated with the first payroll payment, and then to the extent of the employer share of social security tax associated with succeeding payroll payments in the quarter until the credit is used. Don\\'t reduce your monthly tax liability reported on line 16 or your daily tax liability reported on Schedule B (Form 941) below zero. Consistent with the entries on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941), the payroll tax credit should be taken into account in making deposits of employment tax. If any payroll tax credit is remaining at the end of the quarter that has not been used completely because it exceeds the employer share of social security tax for the quarter, the excess credit may be carried forward to the succeeding quarter and allowed as a payroll tax credit for the succeeding quarter. The payroll tax credit may not be taken as a credit against income tax withholding, Medicare tax, or the employee share of social security tax. Also, the remaining payroll tax credit may not be carried back and taken as a credit against wages paid from preceding quarters.  Example. Rose Co. is an employer with a calendar tax year that filed its timely income tax return on April 15, 2020. Rose Co. elected to take the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities on Form 6765. The third quarter of 2020 is the first quarter that begins after Rose Co. filed the income tax return making the payroll tax credit election. Therefore, the payroll tax credit applies against Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid to employees in the third quarter of 2020. Rose Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor. Rose Co. completes Schedule B (Form 941) by reducing the amount of liability entered for the first payroll payment in the third quarter of 2020 that includes wages subject to social security tax by the lesser of (1) its share of social security tax on the wages, or (2) the available payroll tax credit. If the payroll tax credit elected is more than Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on the first payroll payment of the quarter, the excess payroll tax credit would be carried forward to succeeding payroll payments in the third quarter until it is used. If the amount of the payroll tax credit exceeds Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid to its employees in the third quarter, the excess credit would be treated as a payroll tax credit against its share of social security tax on wages paid in the fourth quarter. If the amount of the payroll tax credit remaining exceeded Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid in the fourth quarter, it could be carried forward and treated as a payroll tax credit for the first quarter of 2021.  \\xa0     \\xa0 Part 3: Tell Us About Your Business In Part 3, answer only those questions that apply to your business. If the questions don\\'t apply, leave them blank and go to Part 4.  \\xa0 17. If Your Business Has Closed . . . If you go out of business or stop paying wages, you must file a final return. To tell the IRS that a particular Form 941 is your final return, check the box on line 17 and enter the final date you paid wages in the space provided. For additional filing requirements, see If Your Business Has Closed, earlier.   \\xa0 18. If You’re a Seasonal Employer . . . If you hire employees seasonally—such as for summer or winter only—check the box on line 18. Checking the box tells the IRS not to expect four Forms 941 from you throughout the year because you haven\\'t paid wages regularly. Generally, we won\\'t ask about unfiled returns if at least one taxable return is filed each year. However, you must check the box on line 18 on every Form 941 you file. Otherwise, the IRS will expect a return to be filed for each quarter. Also, when you complete Form 941, be sure to check the box on the top of the form that corresponds to the quarter reported.    \\xa0 Part 4: May We Speak With Your Third-Party Designee? If you want to allow an employee, a paid tax preparer, or another person to discuss your Form 941 with the IRS, check the \"Yes\" box in Part 4. Enter the name, phone number, and the five-digit personal identification number (PIN) of the specific person to speak with—not the name of the firm that prepared your tax return. The designee may choose any five numbers as his or her PIN. By checking \"Yes,\" you authorize the IRS to talk to the person you named (your designee) about any questions we may have while we process your return. You also authorize your designee to do all of the following.    Give us any information that is missing from your return.   Call us for information about processing your return.   Respond to certain IRS notices that you’ve shared with your designee about math errors and return preparation. The IRS won\\'t send notices to your designee.    \\xa0 You’re not authorizing your designee to bind you to anything (including additional tax liability) or to otherwise represent you before the IRS. If you want to expand your designee\\'s authorization, see Pub. 947. The authorization will automatically expire 1 year from the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing your Form 941. If you or your designee wants to terminate the authorization, write to the IRS office for your location using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, earlier.   \\xa0 Part 5: Sign Here (Approved Roles) Complete all information and sign Form 941. The following persons are authorized to sign the return for each type of business entity.    Sole proprietorship—The individual who owns the business.   Corporation (including a limited liability company (LLC) treated as a corporation)—The president, vice president, or other principal officer duly authorized to sign.   Partnership  (including an LLC treated as a partnership)  or unincorporated organization—A responsible and duly authorized partner, member, or officer having knowledge of its affairs.   Single-member LLC treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes—The owner of the LLC or a principal officer duly authorized to sign.   Trust or estate—The fiduciary.    \\xa0 Form 941 may be signed by a duly authorized agent of the taxpayer if a valid power of attorney has been filed.  Alternative signature method. Corporate officers or duly authorized agents may sign Form 941 by rubber stamp, mechanical device, or computer software program. For details and required documentation, see Rev. Proc. 2005-39, 2005-28 I.R.B. 82, available at IRS.gov/irb/2005-28_IRB#RP-2005-39.   \\xa0 Paid Preparer Use Only A paid preparer must sign Form 941 and provide the information in the Paid Preparer Use Only section of Part 5 if the preparer was paid to prepare Form 941 and isn\\'t an employee of the filing entity. Paid preparers must sign paper returns with a manual signature. The preparer must give you a copy of the return in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS. If you’re a paid preparer, enter your Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) in the space provided. Include your complete address. If you work for a firm, enter the firm\\'s name and the EIN of the firm. You can apply for a PTIN online or by filing Form W-12. For more information about applying for a PTIN online, go to IRS.gov/PTIN. You can\\'t use your PTIN in place of the EIN of the tax preparation firm. Generally, don\\'t complete this section if you’re filing the return as a reporting agent and have a valid Form 8655 on file with the IRS. However, a reporting agent must complete this section if the reporting agent offered legal advice, for example, advising the client on determining whether its workers are employees or independent contractors for federal tax purposes.    \\xa0 How To Get Forms, Instructions, and Publications  \\xa0 You can view, download, or print most of the forms, instructions, and publications you may need at IRS.gov/Forms.

La tasa de contribución al Seguro Social es 6.2% tanto para la parte del empleado como la parte del patrono, la misma tasa que correspondió para el año 2019. La base salarial para la retención de la contribución al Seguro Social es $137,700. La tasa de la contribución al Medicare es 1.45% tanto para la parte del empleado como la parte del patrono, la misma tasa que correspondió para el año 2019. No hay límite sobre la cantidad de salarios sujetos a la contribución al Medicare. Las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare se aplican a los salarios de empleados domésticos a quienes usted les paga $2,200 o más en efectivo u otra forma de compensación equitativa en el año 2020. Las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare se aplican a los trabajadores electorales a quienes se les paga $1,900 o más en efectivo u otra forma equivalente de compensación en el año 2020.    \\xa0 Recordatorios  Crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas. Para los años contributivos que comienzan después de 2015, un pequeño negocio calificado puede optar por reclamar hasta $250,000 de su crédito por aumentar las actividades de investigación como un crédito de contribuciones de nómina contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono. El crédito contributivo sobre la nómina tiene que ser elegido en una planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos original que se radica oportunamente (incluyendo prórrogas). Se permite reclamar la parte del crédito utilizada contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono en el primer trimestre natural comenzando después de la fecha en que el pequeño negocio calificado radicó su planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos. La elección y la determinación de la cantidad del crédito que se utilizará contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono se hacen en el Formulario 6765, Credit for Increasing Research Activities (Crédito por aumentar las actividades investigativas), en inglés. La cantidad de la línea 44 del Formulario 6765 tiene que ser informada en el Formulario 8974, Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities (Crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas), en inglés. El Formulario 8974 se utiliza para determinar la cantidad del crédito que se puede utilizar en el trimestre actual. La cantidad de la línea 12 del Formulario 8974 se informa en la línea 11 del Formulario 941-PR. Si usted está reclamando el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina por las actividades investigativas en su Formulario 941-PR, tiene que adjuntar un Formulario 8974. Para más información sobre el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina, vea el Aviso 2017-23 que se encuentra en la página 1100 del Internal Revenue Bulletin (Boletín de Rentas Internas) 2017-16, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2017-16_IRB#NOT-2017-23 y  IRS.gov/ResearchPayrollTC.

Programa de certificación para las organizaciones de patronos profesionales (PEO). La Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (Ley de Logro de una Mejor Calidad de Vida de 2014) requiere del  IRS establecer un programa de certificación voluntaria para las organizaciones de patronos profesionales (PEO, por sus siglas en inglés). Las PEO se encargan de manejar varias responsabilidades administrativas de la nómina y reportes de contribuciones de sus clientes de negocios y, por lo general, se les paga una tarifa basada en los costos de la nómina. Para certificarse y mantener la certificación conforme al programa de certificación, las organizaciones de patronos profesionales certificados (CPEO, por sus siglas en inglés) tienen que cumplir con varios requisitos descritos en las secciones 3511 y 7705 y las guías relacionadas que se han publicado. La certificación como una  CPEO puede afectar las obligaciones de contribuciones de nómina tanto de la CPEO como las de sus clientes. Por lo general, para propósitos de las contribuciones sobre la nómina, una CPEO es tratada como el patrono de cualquier individuo que realiza servicio para un cliente de la CPEO y es cubierto por un contrato descrito en la sección 7705(e)(2) entre la CPEO y el cliente (contrato de la CPEO), pero sólo para los salarios y otra compensación pagados a la persona por la CPEO. Para certificarte como una CPEO, la organización tiene que solicitar a través del IRS Online Registration System (Sistema de registro en línea del IRS), en inglés. Para más información o solicitar para certificarse como una CPEO, visite IRS.gov/CPEO. La información está disponible en inglés. Por lo general, las CPEO tienen que radicar electrónicamente el Formulario 941-PR y el Schedule R (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers (Anexo R (Formulario 941), Registro de asignación para los declarantes de Formularios 941 agregados), en inglés. Para obtener más información sobre el requisito de una CPEO de radicar electrónicamente, vea el Revenue Procedure 2017-14 (Procedimiento Administrativo Contributivo 2017-14), en inglés. Puede ver dicho procedimiento en la página 426  del Internal Revenue Bulletin (I.R.B.) 2017-03 (Boletín de Rentas Internas 2017-03), en inglés, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.   Externalización de las obligaciones de nómina. Por lo general, como patrono, usted es responsable por asegurarse que las planillas de contribución se radiquen y que los depósitos y pagos se efectúen, aun si usted contrata los servicios de un tercero para hacerlo. Usted sigue siendo el responsable aun si el tercero no cumple con la acción requerida. Antes de elegir por externalizar cualquier parte de su nómina y las obligaciones relacionadas con las contribuciones (es decir, retención, declaración y pago de las contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare y al fondo federal de desempleo (FUTA, por sus siglas en inglés)) a un tercero pagador, tal como un proveedor de servicios de nómina o agente de reportación, visite el sitio web IRS.gov/OutsourcingPayrollDuties para información útil sobre este tema. Dicha información está disponible en inglés. Si una CPEO paga los salarios y otra compensación de cualquier individuo que realiza servicio para un cliente de la CPEO y éste está cubierto por un contrato descrito en la sección 7705(e)(2) entre la CPEO y el cliente, la CPEO es tratada para propósitos de las contribuciones sobre la nómina, como el patrono de dicho empleado, pero sólo para salarios y otra compensación pagada al individuo por la CPEO. Sin embargo, con respecto a ciertos empleados cubiertos por un contrato de la CPEO, usted también puede ser tratado como un patrono de los empleados y, en consecuencia, también puede ser responsable de las contribuciones federales sobre los salarios y otra compensación pagada por la CPEO a dichos empleados. Para más información sobre los diferentes tipos de arreglos de terceros pagadores, vea el apartado 16 titulado Third Party Payer Arrangements (Arreglos de un tercero pagador) en la Pub. 15, en inglés.   Declarantes de Formularios 941-PR agregados. Los agentes y las CPEO tienen que completar el Schedule R (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers (Anexo R (Formulario 941), Registro de asignación para los declarantes de Formularios 941 agregados), en inglés, cuando radiquen un Formulario 941-PR agregado. Los Formularios 941-PR agregados son radicados por agentes de aquéllos quienes reciben servicios de cuidado en el hogar aprobados por el IRS conforme a la sección 3504. Para solicitar la aprobación para actuar como un agente para un empleador o patrono, el agente radica el Formulario 2678 con el IRS, a menos que usted sea una agencia del gobierno estatal o local que actúa como agente de acuerdo con los procedimientos especiales provistos en el Revenue Procedure 2013-39) (Procedimiento Administrativo Contributivo 2013-39) que aparece en la página 830 del Internal Revenue Bulletin 2013-52 (Boletín de Rentas Internas) 2013-52, en inglés, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39. Las CPEO aprobadas por el IRS conforme a la sección 7705 pueden radicar Formularios 941-PR agregados. Para ser una CPEO, la organización tiene que solicitar a través del IRS Online Registration System (Sistema de registro en línea del IRS), en inglés, visitando IRS.gov/CPEO. Las CPEO radican el Formulario 8973, Certified Professional Employer Organization/Customer Reporting Agreement (Organización de empresarios profesionales certificados/Acuerdo de radicación del cliente), en inglés, para notificar al IRS que comenzaron o terminaron un contrato de servicio con un cliente. Por lo general, las CPEO tienen que radicar el Formulario 941-PR y el Anexo R (Formulario 941) electrónicamente. Para obtener más información sobre el requisito de una CPEO de radicar electrónicamente, vea el Revenue Procedure 2017-14 (Procedimiento Administrativo Contributivo 2017-14), en inglés. Puede ver dicho procedimiento en la página 426 del Internal Revenue Bulletin (I.R.B.) 2017-03 (Boletín de Rentas Internas 2017-03), en inglés, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.   \\xa0 Si tanto un patrono como un agente autorizado conforme a la sección 3504, pagaron salarios a un empleado durante un trimestre, o si tanto un patrono como una CPEO pagaron salarios a un empleado durante un trimestre, tanto el patrono como el agente autorizado conforme a la sección 3504 (o la CPEO, si corresponde) tienen que radicar el Formulario 941-PR declarando los salarios que cada entidad pagó al empleado durante el trimestre correspondiente y emitir los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR declarando los salarios que cada entidad pagó al empleado durante el año.  El crédito contributivo por oportunidad de trabajo para organizaciones calificadas exentas de contribución que contratan a veteranos calificados. Las organizaciones calificadas exentas de contribuciones que contratan veteranos desempleados que reúnen los requisitos pueden reclamar el crédito contributivo por oportunidad de trabajo contra su contribución sobre la nómina utilizando el Formulario 5884-C, Work Opportunity Credit for Qualified Tax-Exempt Organizations Hiring Qualified Veterans (Crédito por oportunidad de trabajo para organizaciones exentas de contribuciones calificadas que contratan a veteranos calificados), en inglés.

La radicación de un Formulario 941-X (PR) antes de radicar el Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre puede resultar en errores o demoras en la tramitación de su Formulario 941-X (PR). Para más información, vea las Instrucciones para el Formulario 941-X (PR).  \\xa0 Si usted tiene derecho a reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA pero de otra manera no se le requiere radicar el Formulario 941-PR, radique el Formulario 941-PR con cero (-0-) anotado en la línea 14 antes de radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) para reclamar el crédito.   Corrección del Formulario 941-PR radicado previamente. Si descubre un error en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó previamente, haga la corrección usando el Formulario 941-X (PR).

Los depósitos de la contribución federal tienen que efectuarse por transferencia electrónica de fondos (EFT). Usted tiene que utilizar la transferencia electrónica de fondos (EFT, por sus siglas en inglés) para depositar toda contribución federal. Por lo general, una EFT se realiza mediante el Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (Sistema electrónico de pagos de la contribución federal o EFTPS, por sus siglas en inglés). Si usted no desea utilizar el EFTPS, puede hacer arreglos para que su preparador profesional, institución financiera, servicio de nóminas u otro tercero de confianza le haga los depósitos electrónicamente de parte de usted. También puede hacer arreglos para que su institución financiera inicie una transferencia electrónica realizada el mismo día de pago de parte de usted. El EFTPS es un servicio gratuito provisto por el Departamento del Tesoro. Podría verse obligado a pagar un cargo por los servicios de un preparador profesional, institución financiera, servicio de nómina u otro tercero. Para más información sobre los depósitos de la contribución federal, vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179. Para obtener más información sobre el EFTPS o para inscribirse en el EFTPS, visite el sitio web EFTPS.gov o llame al Servicio al Cliente del EFTPS en español al 800-244-4829 o, si es usuario de equipo TDD, llame al 800-733-4829. Información adicional sobre el EFTPS está disponible en la Pub. 966(SP).   \\xa0 Para que un depósito efectuado por medio del EFTPS se considere hecho a su debido tiempo, tiene que transmitir el depósito a más tardar a las 8 p.m. horario del Este de los Estados Unidos el día anterior a la fecha de vencimiento para efectuar el depósito. Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para obtener más detalles.  \\xa0 Opción de pago el mismo día por medio de una transferencia electrónica. Si no transmite una transacción de depósito en el EFTPS para las 8 p.m. horario del Este de los Estados Unidos el día anterior a la fecha de vencimiento para efectuar un depósito, todavía puede efectuar a tiempo su depósito por medio del Federal Tax Collection Service (Servicio de recaudación de la contribución federal o FTCS, por sus siglas en inglés) para efectuar un pago electrónico el mismo día. Para utilizar el método de pago efectuado el mismo día, tendrá que hacer los trámites con su institución financiera con anticipación.

Para obtener más detalles sobre la información que necesita proveer a su institución financiera para poder efectuar un pago electrónico el mismo día, visite IRS.gov/SameDayWire y pulse sobre Español.   \\xa0 Puntualidad de los depósitos de la contribución federal. Si se requiere que un depósito se efectúe en un día que no es un día laborable, se considera que dicho depósito se hace a tiempo si se hace para el cierre de operaciones comerciales del siguiente día laborable. Un \"día laborable\" es todo día que no sea sábado, domingo o día feriado oficial. El término \"día feriado oficial\" para propósitos de efectuar los depósitos únicamente incluye los días feriados oficiales en el Distrito de Columbia. Dichos días feriados oficiales se indican en el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179.   Radicación y pago por medios electrónicos. Los negocios pueden disfrutar de los beneficios de radicar sus planillas de contribución y pagar sus contribuciones federales por medios electrónicos.

Para más detalles, vea las instrucciones para los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR y W-3PR.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Si usted radica su planilla o si paga sus contribuciones federales por medios electrónicos, se requiere tener un número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés) válido en el momento en que se radica la planilla o en que se efectúa el pago. Si no provee un EIN válido, la planilla o el pago no será tramitado. Esta acción puede resultar en multas. Visite Número de identificación patronal (EIN), más adelante, para más información.  \\xa0 Retiro electrónico de fondos (EFW). Si radica el Formulario 941-PR electrónicamente, puede radicar (e-file) y usar EFW, (retiro electrónico de fondos) para pagar el saldo adeudado en un solo paso, usando programas de computadora (software) para la preparación de planillas o por medio de un preparador profesional de contribuciones.

Dicha publicación explica los requisitos para la retención, el depósito y el pago de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Le explica sobre los formularios que tiene que darle a sus empleados, los formularios que sus empleados tienen que darle a usted y aquéllos que usted tiene que enviar al IRS. Vea la Pub. 15-A, en inglés, para obtener información especializada sobre las contribuciones sobre la nómina que complementa la información básica contenida en la Pub. 179 o visite el sitio web IRS.gov e ingrese \" employment taxes \" (contribuciones sobre la nómina) en el encasillado Search (Buscar). Dicha información está disponible en inglés. La ley federal requiere que usted, como patrono, les retenga ciertas contribuciones a los cheques de salario de sus empleados. Cada vez que paga salarios, tiene que retener —es decir, descontar de los cheques de salario de sus empleados— ciertas cantidades para pagar la contribución al Seguro Social y la contribución al Medicare. También tiene que retener la Contribución Adicional al Medicare de los salarios en exceso de $200,000 que le paga a un empleado en un año natural. De acuerdo con el sistema de la retención de contribuciones, estas mismas que se les retienen a sus empleados se acreditarán en sus cuentas del Seguro Social para pagar sus obligaciones contributivas correspondientes. La ley federal también requiere que usted pague toda obligación resultante de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare correspondientes al patrono. No se les retiene esta parte de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare a los empleados.   \\xa0 Quién tiene que radicar el Formulario 941-PR Por lo general, tiene que radicar una planilla para el primer trimestre en el cual usted paga salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare, y para cada trimestre de allí en adelante hasta que usted radique una planilla final. Use el Formulario 941-PR si el lugar principal donde desempeña sus actividades comerciales está en Puerto Rico o si tiene empleados que están sujetos a la retención de la contribución sobre los ingresos de Puerto Rico. Use el Formulario 941-PR para declarar las siguientes cantidades:    Salarios que ha pagado sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare.   Propinas que sus empleados han recibido sujetas a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare.   Las partes correspondientes al patrono y al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare.   Contribución Adicional al Medicare retenida de los empleados.   Ajustes hechos en el trimestre en curso a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare por fracciones de centavos, pagos por enfermedad, propinas y seguro de vida colectivo a término fijo.   Crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas.    \\xa0 No use el Formulario 941-PR si tiene tanto a empleados que están sujetos a la retención de la contribución federal sobre ingresos de los Estados Unidos como a empleados que no están sujetos a la retención de la contribución federal sobre ingresos de los Estados Unidos. En su lugar, tiene que radicar sólo el Formulario 941 (o Formulario 944 (SP)) e incluir todos los salarios de sus empleados en ese formulario. Tampoco, use el Formulario 941-PR para declarar las contribuciones de desempleo. Use el Formulario 940-PR, Planilla para la Declaración Federal Anual del Patrono de la Contribución Federal para el Desempleo (FUTA) para declarar las contribuciones de desempleo. Tiene que radicar una planilla cada trimestre aunque no haya tenido ninguna obligación contributiva que declarar, a no ser que radique una planilla final o le corresponda una de las Excepciones, a continuación.  \\xa0 Excepciones Reglas especiales le corresponden a ciertos patronos:    Si recibió una notificación que le informa que tiene que radicar el Formulario 944(SP), tiene que radicar el Formulario 944(SP) anualmente no radique el Formulario 941-PR trimestralmente.   Los patronos estacionales no tienen que radicar el Formulario 941-PR para los trimestres durante los cuales no han tenido una obligación contributiva debido a que no han pagado salarios. Para notificarle al IRS que no va a radicar una planilla por uno o más trimestres del año, marque el encasillado que aparece en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-PR en cada trimestre que radica dicho formulario. Por lo general, el IRS no le preguntará sobre planillas que no han sido radicadas si por lo menos una planilla en la cual se indica una obligación contributiva es radicada cada año. No obstante, tiene que marcar el encasillado en la línea 18 en cada planilla trimestral que radique. De otra manera, el IRS anticipará que radicará una planilla para cada trimestre.   Los patronos de empleados domésticos normalmente no radican el Formulario 941-PR. Vea la Pub. 179, el Anexo H-PR (Formulario 1040-PR), Contribuciones sobre el Empleo de Empleados Domésticos, sus instrucciones por separado y la Pub. 926, ésta última en inglés.

Si vende o transfiere su negocio durante el trimestre, tanto usted como el nuevo dueño tienen, cada uno, que radicar un Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre en el cual se efectuó la transferencia. Declare únicamente los salarios que usted mismo pagó. Cuando se consolidan dos empresas, la empresa que continúa en vigor tiene que radicar un Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre en el cual ocurrió la fusión y la otra empresa tiene que radicar una planilla final. Cuando la clasificación de un negocio cambia a otra, tal como un negocio de un solo dueño que se convierte en una sociedad colectiva (partnership) o en una corporación, se considera este tipo de cambio una transferencia. Si ocurre una transferencia, quizás tenga que obtener un número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés) nuevo. Vea la Pub.1635, en inglés, y el apartado 3 de la Pub. 179 para más detalles. Asegúrese de adjuntar una declaración que incluya lo siguiente:    El nombre del nuevo dueño (o el nombre nuevo de la empresa);   Si la empresa actualmente es un negocio propio, sociedad colectiva (partnership) o corporación (sociedad anónima);   La clase de cambio que se efectuó (venta o transferencia);   La fecha en la cual se efectuó el cambio; y   El nombre del individuo que lleva los archivos de la nómina y la dirección donde se guardarán tales archivos.    \\xa0   \\xa0    Si cierra su negocio...

Además, adjunte una declaración a su planilla que indique el nombre del individuo que conservará los archivos de la nómina y la dirección del lugar en donde se guardarán dichos archivos. Vea también Planilla final, más adelante. Si participó en una fusión estatutaria o consolidación, o califica para la clasificación de predecesor-sucesor debido a una adquisición, debería, por lo general, radicar el Anexo D (Schedule D) del Formulario 941, Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations (Informe de discrepancias causadas por adquisiciones, fusiones o consolidaciones), en inglés. Vea las Instrucciones para el Anexo D (Formulario 941) a fin de determinar si debe radicar el Anexo D (Formulario 941) y cuándo debe radicarlo.    \\xa0 Planilla final Si cierra su negocio o si deja de pagar salarios a sus empleados, tiene que radicar una planilla final. Para notificarle al IRS que el Formulario 941-PR para un trimestre particular es su planilla final, marque el encasillado en la línea 17 y anote la última fecha en que pagó salarios. También adjunte una declaración a su planilla que indique el nombre de la persona que se quedará con los archivos o récords correspondientes a la nómina y la dirección en donde permanecerán. Comuníquese con el Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico para obtener información sobre cuándo debe entregarles a sus empleados el Formulario 499R-2/W-2PR que corresponda al año natural en que ocurrió el cierre. También debe comunicarse con la Administración del Seguro Social (SSA, por sus siglas en inglés) para saber la fecha límite para radicar ante la SSA sus Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR finales. Si tiene empleados que son contratados inmediatamente por el patrono sucesor, vea el Revenue Procedure 2004-53 (Procedimiento Administrativo Contributivo 2004-53 o Rev. Proc. 2004-53, por su abreviatura en inglés). Puede encontrar el Rev. Proc. 2004-53 en la página 320 del Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-34 (Boletín de Rentas Internas 2004-34) en el sitio web IRS.gov/irb/2004-53_IRB#RP-2004-34.    \\xa0 ¿Cuándo tiene que radicar la planilla? Radique el Formulario 941-PR inicial para cada trimestre en el cual usted pagó por primera vez salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Vea la tabla titulada Cuándo tiene que radicar el Formulario 941-PR, más adelante. Luego tendrá que radicar para cada trimestre que le sigue —cada 3 meses— aun si no tiene contribuciones que declarar, a menos que usted sea un patrono estacional o si radica su planilla final. Vea la explicación sobre patronos estacionales bajo Excepciones y el tema Si cierra su negocio..., anteriormente. Radique el Formulario 941-PR sólo una vez por cada trimestre. Si radica por medios electrónicos, no radique un Formulario 941-PR en papel.

Si hace depósitos a su debido tiempo y paga las contribuciones trimestrales en su totalidad, puede radicar para el décimo día del segundo mes siguiente al final del trimestre. Por ejemplo, si usted hizo depósitos a su debido tiempo en su totalidad durante el primer trimestre, puede radicar el Formulario 941-PR el 10 de mayo. Si recibimos el Formulario 941-PR después de la fecha de vencimiento, lo trataremos como si fuera radicado a tiempo si el sobre que contiene el Formulario 941-PR está debidamente rotulado, tiene suficiente franqueo y el matasellos del Servicio Postal de los EE.UU. está fechado a más tardar en la fecha de vencimiento, o si se envió por medio de un servicio de entrega privado (PDS, por sus siglas en inglés) aceptado por el IRS a más tardar en la fecha de vencimiento. Si no sigue estas pautas, generalmente consideramos que el Formulario 941-PR fue radicado en la fecha en que realmente se recibió. Para más información sobre PDS, vea Adónde deberá enviar la planilla, más adelante. Si la fecha de vencimiento para radicar una planilla es un sábado, domingo o día feriado oficial, podrá radicar la planilla el próximo día laborable.   \\xa0 Cómo deberá completar el Formulario 941-PR Escriba a mano, a maquinilla o por medio de su computadora su EIN, nombre y dirección en los espacios provistos. También anote su nombre y su EIN en la parte superior de la segunda página. No use su número de Seguro Social (SSN, por sus siglas en inglés) ni su número de identificación personal del contribuyente (ITIN, por sus siglas en inglés). Por lo general, anotará el nombre comercial (legal) que usó al solicitar su EIN. Por ejemplo, si es dueño único de su negocio, anotará \"Roberto Herrera\" en la línea que dice \"Nombre\" y \"Bicicletas Roberto\" donde dice \"Nombre comercial\". Deje en blanco la línea \"Nombre comercial\" si este nombre es igual al \"Nombre\" de usted. Si utiliza un preparador remunerado para completar el Formulario 941-PR, asegúrese de que el preparador muestre su nombre comercial exactamente como apareció cuando solicitó su EIN.  Número de identificación patronal (EIN). Para asegurar que los negocios cumplan con las leyes federales de la contribución, el IRS se ocupa de controlar los pagos de contribución mediante el uso de un sistema de números para identificar a los contribuyentes. El número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés) es un número especial y singular que consta de nueve dígitos que el IRS les expide a todas las corporaciones y sociedades colectivas, así como a algunos negocios de un solo dueño. Todo negocio que tenga que obtener un EIN tiene que solicitar este número y anotarlo en toda planilla, pago o informe de contribución mientras esté en operación. Su negocio debe tener solamente un EIN. Si tiene más de un número y no está seguro del número que debe usar, escriba a la oficina del IRS donde suele radicar sus planillas de contribución (la dirección que usa cuando envía planillas \"Sin un pago\", bajo Adónde deberá enviar la planilla, más adelante), o llame al IRS al 800-829-4933.

Si usted no ha recibido su EIN antes de la fecha de vencimiento del Formulario 941-PR, escriba \" Applied For \" (Solicitado) y la fecha en que solicitó el EIN en el espacio correspondiente.  \\xa0 Si usted radica su planilla de contribución electrónicamente, un EIN válido se requiere en el momento de radicar su planilla. Si no provee un EIN válido, la planilla no será aceptada. Esto puede resultar en multas.  \\xa0 Asegúrese siempre que el EIN que aparezca en el formulario que radica sea exactamente igual al EIN que el IRS le designó a su negocio. No use su SSN o ITIN en ninguna planilla que pida un EIN. La radicación de un Formulario 941-PR con un EIN incorrecto o el uso de un EIN que pertenece a otro negocio puede resultar en multas y demoras en la tramitación de su planilla.   Si cambia su nombre comercial, dirección comercial o parte responsable... Notifíquele al IRS inmediatamente si cambia el nombre comercial, dirección comercial o parte responsable.     Escriba a la oficina del IRS donde usted radica sus planillas (utilizando la dirección \"Sin un pago\", que se encuentra bajo Adónde deberá enviar la planilla, más adelante) para notificarle al IRS sobre todo cambio de nombre comercial. Vea la Pub. 1635, en inglés, para determinar si necesita solicitar un nuevo EIN.   Complete y envíe por correo el Formulario 8822-B, en inglés, para notificarle al IRS sobre un cambio en la dirección comercial o parte responsable. No envíe el Formulario 8822-B junto con el Formulario 941-PR. Si desea ver la definición de \"parte responsable\", vea las Instrucciones para el Formulario SS-4PR.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Marque el encasillado para el trimestre Debajo de Informe para este trimestre de 2020 en la parte superior del Formulario 941-PR, marque el encasillado del trimestre para el cual radica esta planilla. Asegúrese que el trimestre en cuestión sea el mismo que aparece en todo Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), Registro de la Obligación Contributiva para los Depositantes de Itinerario Bisemanal, que usted adjunte.   \\xa0 Cómo completar y radicar el Formulario 941-PR Anote las partidas en el Formulario 941-PR tal como se indica a continuación para evitar problemas con su tramitación:    Use letra de imprenta de fuente Courier de 10 puntos (si es posible) para cada anotación que escriba a maquinilla o con computadora para completar su formulario. Los formularios en formato de documento portátil (PDF, por sus siglas en inglés) en IRS.gov tienen campos editables con especificaciones de fuentes aceptables.   Omita el signo de dólares y puntos decimales. El uso de comas es opcional. Anote las cantidades en dólares a la izquierda del punto decimal impreso y los centavos a la derecha del punto. No redondee las cantidades a números enteros. Siempre anote la cantidad para los centavos, aun cuando éstos son ceros.   Deje en blanco (menos las líneas 1 y 12) todo espacio para anotar datos que tengan un valor de cero.   Use el signo de menos al anotar cantidades negativas (si es posible). De otra manera, use paréntesis.   Anote su nombre y su EIN en todas las páginas y documentos que adjunte.   Anote su nombre, EIN, \"Formulario 941-PR\" y el período contributivo en todos los documentos que anexe.

Si las cantidades no concuerdan, es posible que el IRS o la SSA se comunique con usted. Las cantidades que se concilian son las siguientes:    Salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social.   Propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social.   Salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare.    \\xa0 Use el Anexo D (Formulario 941), en inglés, para explicar ciertas diferencias o discrepancias relacionadas con los salarios, contribuciones y pagos entre los Formularios 941-PR, Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR y los Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR, Corrección al Comprobante de Retención, debidas a adquisiciones, fusiones o consolidaciones estatutarias.

Para la dirección postal a utilizar si está usando un PDS, visite IRS.gov/PDSstreetAddresses, en inglés.  \\xa0 Las direcciones adonde debe enviar la planilla pudieron haber cambiado de las que utilizó para declarar las contribuciones sobre la nómina en años anteriores. No envíe el Formulario 941-PR ni ningún pago a la SSA.   \\xa0 Cómo hacer los depósitos  \\xa0 Usted tiene que depositar toda contribución electrónicamente por transferencia electrónica de fondos (EFT). Para obtener información, vea el tema Los depósitos de la contribución federal tienen que efectuarse por transferencia electrónica de fondos (EFT) bajo Recordatorios.  \\xa0 ¿Tiene que depositar sus contribuciones? Puede estar obligado a depositar tanto la contribución al Seguro Social como al Medicare correspondientes al patrono y al empleado.    Si el total de sus contribuciones después de considerar los ajustes y créditos (línea 12) es menos de $2,500 para el trimestre en curso o el trimestre anterior y usted no tuvo una obligación de depositar $100,000 el próximo día durante el trimestre en curso. No tiene que hacer un depósito. Para evitar una multa, tiene que pagar la cantidad en su totalidad con una planilla radicada a su debido tiempo o tiene que depositar la cantidad oportunamente. Para más información sobre cómo pagar junto con una planilla radicada a tiempo, vea las instrucciones de la línea 14, más adelante. Si no está seguro si su obligación total por pagar para el trimestre en curso será menos de $2,500 (y su obligación para el trimestre anterior no fue menos de $2,500), haga los depósitos según las reglas del itinerario mensual o bisemanal para evitar multas por no depositar (FTD).   Si el total de sus contribuciones después de considerar los ajustes y créditos (línea 12) es $2,500 o más para el trimestre en curso y el trimestre anterior. Tiene que hacer depósitos conforme a su itinerario de depósitos. Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para la información sobre los pagos efectuados de acuerdo a la regla de la exactitud de los depósitos y para las reglas sobre los depósitos de la contribución federal.    \\xa0 Usted puede reducir los depósitos durante el trimestre por la cantidad del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA que se reflejarán en su Formulario 941-X (PR), pero sólo si utiliza el proceso de reclamación y no el proceso de ajuste para reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA en el Formulario 941-X (PR) para el trimestre. El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA se considera como un crédito en el primer día del período de su planilla (es decir, 1 de enero, 1 de abril, 1 de julio o 1 de octubre). Sin embargo, debido a que el crédito ahora se reclama en el Formulario 941-X (PR) radicado después de la radicación del Formulario 941-PR, un patrono que reduzca sus depósitos requeridos en anticipación del crédito recibirá un aviso generado por el sistema reflejando un saldo adeudado y multas asociadas e intereses, si es aplicable. El saldo adeudado, así como las multas e intereses correspondientes resultantes de la reducción de los depósitos con anticipación del crédito serán reducidas cuando se aplique el crédito. Tal reducción generalmente ocurrirá sin ninguna otra acción de parte del patrono. Como alternativa, para evitar que se reciba un aviso de saldo adeudado generado por el sistema, el patrono puede efectuar sus depósitos sin considerar la reducción en la obligación debido a la anticipación del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA, y luego puede seguir los procedimientos para radicar una reclamación para un reembolso o ajuste en la planilla utilizando el Formulario 941-X (PR).   \\xa0 ¿Cuándo tiene que depositar sus contribuciones?  \\xa0    Determine si es depositante de itinerario mensual o bisemanal para el trimestre    El IRS usa dos clases de reglas de depósito para determinar cuándo los negocios tienen que depositar sus contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Esos itinerarios le informarán cuándo debe hacer un depósito después de un día de pago. Su itinerario de depósitos no se determina por la frecuencia en que le paga a sus empleados. Su itinerario de depósitos depende del total de la obligación contributiva que declaró en el Formulario 941-PR durante el período retroactivo de los 4 trimestres anteriores (desde el 1 de julio del segundo año natural anterior (penúltimo año) hasta el 30 de junio del año natural pasado). Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para más detalles. Si radicó el Formulario 944(SP) en 2018 ó 2019, su período retroactivo es el año natural 2018. Antes del comienzo de cada año natural, tiene que determinar cuál de los itinerarios de depósitos tiene que usar.    Si declaró $50,000 o menos por concepto de contribuciones durante el período retroactivo, usted es depositante de itinerario mensual.   Si declaró más de $50,000 por concepto de contribuciones durante el período retroactivo, usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Si usted es depositante de itinerario mensual y acumula $100,000 o más por concepto de contribuciones en cualquier día durante el período de depósito, entonces se convierte en depositante de itinerario bisemanal en el próximo día y por el resto del año natural y el año siguiente. Vea la Regla de depositar $100,000 el próximo día en el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para más información.     \\xa0 ¿Qué hay que saber acerca de las multas e intereses?  \\xa0 Cómo evitar el pago de multas e intereses Puede evitar el pago de multas e intereses si hace todo lo indicado a continuación:    Deposita o paga las contribuciones cuando se debe hacer.   Radica a su debido tiempo su Formulario 941-PR debidamente completado.   Declara correctamente su obligación contributiva.   Entrega cheques válidos para el pago de las contribuciones.   Entrega los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR correctos a sus empleados.   Radica el Formulario W-3PR junto a los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR ante la SSA a su debido tiempo y sin errores.    \\xa0 Se cobran multas e intereses sobre las contribuciones pagadas fuera de plazo y sobre las planillas radicadas fuera de plazo a una tasa fijada conforme a la ley. Vea los apartados 11 y 12 de la Pub. 179 para más detalles. Use el Formulario 843, en inglés, para solicitar un reembolso o reducción en los intereses o multas que le han sido tasados. No solicite la reducción de multas o intereses en los Formularios 941-PR o 941-X (PR). Si recibe una notificación de multas después de que haya radicado esta planilla, responda a la notificación con una explicación y determinaremos si cumple el criterio de lo que se considera ser causas razonables. No adjunte dicha explicación cuando radique su planilla.  \\xa0 Si las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare que se tienen que retener (es decir, contribuciones al fondo fiduciario) no se retienen, no se depositan o no se pagan al Tesoro de los Estados Unidos, se le podría imponer una multa por recuperación del fondo fiduciario. La multa es del 100% de la contribución al fondo fiduciario adeudada. Si estas contribuciones no pagadas no se le pueden cobrar inmediatamente al patrono o al negocio, la multa por recuperación del fondo fiduciario puede ser impuesta a las personas que el IRS determine que son responsables del cobro, de la contabilidad o del pago por estas contribuciones y que intencionalmente no lo hacen. Vea el apartado 11 de la Pub. 179 para más información.    \\xa0 Ajuste a la contribución sobre las propinas Si, para el día 10 del mes siguiente al mes en que recibió la declaración de propinas del empleado, no tiene suficientes fondos del empleado para retener la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare, entonces ya no tendrá que recaudarlas. Declare la cantidad de las propinas en su totalidad en las líneas 5b (Propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social), 5c (Salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al  Medicare) y, si cumple con la cantidad del límite superior, en la línea 5d (Salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al  Medicare  ). Incluya en la línea 9, por concepto de un ajuste negativo, el total de la parte no recaudada correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare.   \\xa0 ¿Dónde puede obtener formularios? Vea la Pub. 179 para obtener información sobre cómo pedir formularios del IRS por teléfono, por correo o por Internet. También puede obtener algunos de los formularios del IRS en la dirección indicada a continuación: Internal Revenue Service City View Plaza II Bldg. 48 Carr. 165 km. 1.2 Guaynabo, PR 00968-8000 \\xa0   \\xa0 Retención de la contribución federal sobre los ingresos En el caso de un empleado que es ciudadano de los Estados Unidos y que trabaja para un patrono que no sea el gobierno de los Estados Unidos o alguna de sus agencias, no hay que retener la contribución federal sobre los ingresos de los salarios pagados a dicho empleado si el patrono está obligado a retener la contribución sobre ingresos de Puerto Rico en conformidad con sus leyes o cuando es razonable creer que tal empleado será, durante todo el año natural, residente bona fide de Puerto Rico. No obstante, si un patrono tiene un empleado en Puerto Rico que es ciudadano de los Estados Unidos y de cuyos salarios no se exige la retención de la contribución sobre los ingresos de acuerdo con la ley de Puerto Rico, y si tal empleado no piensa adquirir residencia bona fide en Puerto Rico por todo el año natural, dicho patrono está obligado a retener la contribución federal sobre los ingresos de los salarios pagados al mencionado empleado. En casos como éste, el patrono debe consultar con la oficina del IRS en Guaynabo. Use el Formulario 941, en inglés, en lugar del Formulario 941-PR si tiene que retener la contribución federal sobre los ingresos de los salarios pagados a sus empleados. Puede obtener los formularios necesarios y las instrucciones pertinentes en la oficina en Guaynabo o descargándolos del sitio web del IRS en IRS.gov/Forms.

Para excepciones religiosas, vea el apartado 4 de la Pub. 15-A, en inglés.  \\xa0 Si es patrono gubernamental, los salarios que paga no están exentos automáticamente de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Sus empleados podrían estar amparados por la ley o por un acuerdo voluntario con la SSA conforme a la sección 218. Para más información, vea la Pub. 963, Federal-State Reference Guide (Guía de consulta federal y estatal), en inglés.   \\xa0 5a–5e.

Anote aquí el total de los salarios, compensación por enfermedad y beneficios marginales sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social que pagó a sus empleados durante el trimestre. Para este propósito, la compensación por enfermedad incluye los pagos hechos a sus empleados por una compañía de seguros y por los cuales usted fue notificado oportunamente por dicha compañía de seguros. Vea el apartado 6 de la Pub. 15-A, en inglés, para más información sobre la declaración de la compensación por enfermedad. Anote la cantidad antes de descontar las deducciones de nómina.

Su empleado tiene que declararle las propinas en efectivo para el día 10 del mes siguiente al mes en que recibió dichas propinas. Las propinas en efectivo incluyen propinas pagadas en efectivo, cheque, tarjeta de débito y tarjeta de crédito. El informe debe incluir propinas cargadas (por ejemplo, cargos de las tarjetas de crédito y débito) que usted le pagó a los empleados por pagos provenientes de tarjetas de crédito de los clientes, propinas que el empleado recibió directamente de los clientes y propinas que recibió de otros empleados bajo cualquier acuerdo de propinas compartidas. Los empleados que reciben propinas directamente e indirectamente tienen que declararle las propinas al patrono. No se requiere declarar las propinas para meses en que las propinas sumen menos de $20. Los empleados pueden usar el Formulario 4070-PR (disponible solamente en la Pub. 1244-PR), o cualquier declaración por escrito o informe electrónico de propinas recibidas. No incluya las propinas asignadas en esta línea. En vez de incluirlas aquí, declárelas en el Formulario 8027, en inglés.

Se le requiere que comience la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare en el período de pago en el que le paga a un empleado un salario de más de $200,000 y después continuar la retención en cada período de pago hasta el final del año natural. La Contribución Adicional al Medicare sólo le corresponde al empleado. No hay ninguna Contribución Adicional al Medicare que le corresponda a la parte del patrono. Todos los salarios que están sujetos a la contribución al Medicare están sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare si éstos se pagan en exceso del límite de $200,000. Para más información sobre qué salarios están sujetos a la contribución al Medicare, vea la tabla titulada Reglas especiales para varias clases de servicios y de pagos en el apartado 15 de la Pub.179.

Notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q): Contribución adeudada por propinas no declaradas Anote el saldo de contribución adeudado que aparece en el Notice and Demand under Section 3121(q) (Notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q)), en inglés, en la línea 5f. El IRS emite esta notificación para informarle a un patrono de la cantidad de propinas recibidas por empleados que no fueron declaradas o que fueron declaradas de menos al patrono. El patrono no es responsable de pagar la parte correspondiente del patrono de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare por las propinas no declaradas hasta que el IRS le emita una notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q) a dicho patrono. La contribución adeudada pudo haber sido determinada calculando las propinas declaradas al IRS en el Formulario 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income (Contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare sobre el ingreso de propinas no declaradas), en inglés, del empleado, u otras propinas que el IRS determinó que no fueron declaradas al patrono después de una revisión. Para obtener más información, vea el Revenue Ruling 2012-18 (Resolución administrativa contributiva 2012-18) que aparece en la página 1032 del I.R.B. 2012-26, disponible en IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18. Deposite la contribución dentro del período requerido que le corresponde a su itinerario de depósito para evitar cualquier multa. La contribución se tratará como acumulada por el patrono en la parte titulada Date of Notice and Demand (Fecha de notificación y solicitud), en inglés, la cual está impresa en la notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q). El patrono tiene que incluir esta cantidad en la línea apropiada del formulario que corresponde a la obligación contributiva federal (la Parte 2 del Formulario 941-PR para un depositante de itinerario mensual o en el Anexo B del Formulario 941-PR para un depositante de itinerario bisemanal).   \\xa0 6. Total de contribuciones antes de ajustes Sume el total de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare antes de tomar en cuenta los ajustes (línea 5e) y toda contribución adeudada de la notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q) declarada en la línea 5f. Anote el resultado en la línea 6.   \\xa0 7–9. Ajustes a la contribución Anote en las líneas 7 a 9 las cantidades de contribución que resultaron por un ajuste del trimestre en curso. Use el signo de menos (si es posible) para indicar un ajuste que disminuya las contribuciones totales anotadas en la línea 6 en vez de usar paréntesis. Esto mejora la veracidad de los programas de computadoras (software) para escanear que utiliza el IRS. Por ejemplo, declare \"-10.59\" en vez de \"(10.59)\". Sin embargo, si su programa de computadora sólo permite el uso de los paréntesis para declarar cantidades negativas, puede usarlos.  Ajustes del trimestre en curso. En ciertos casos, tendrá que ajustar las cantidades declaradas como contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare en la columna 2 de las líneas 5a a 5d para poder determinar su obligación contributiva correcta en el Formulario 941-PR para este trimestre. Vea el apartado 12 de la Pub. 179.  \\xa0 7. Ajustes por fracciones de centavos del trimestre actual. Anote los ajustes por fracciones de centavos (debido al redondeo de las cifras) que tienen que ver con la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare retenidas. La parte correspondiente al empleado de las cantidades indicadas en la columna 2 de las líneas 5a a 5d puede diferir un poco de las cantidades realmente retenidas de los pagos de sus empleados debido al redondeo de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare que ocurrió al aplicar las tasas estatutarias. Este ajuste puede ser un ajuste positivo o negativo.   \\xa0 8. Ajustes por compensación por enfermedad del trimestre actual. Anote un ajuste negativo por la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al seguro Medicare retenidas y pagadas por su tercero pagador de compensación por enfermedad con respecto a toda la compensación por enfermedad pagada por el tercero pagador. Estos salarios deben ser incluidos en la línea 5a y la línea 5c y, si cumple con la cantidad del límite superior, en la línea 5d. Si usted es el tercero pagador de compensación por enfermedad, anote un ajuste negativo de la parte correspondiente al patrono de estas contribuciones que se requiere ser pagado por el patrono.   \\xa0 9. Ajustes por propinas y por seguro de vida colectivo a término fijo del trimestre actual. Anote un ajuste negativo por:    La parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare no retenidas sobre las propinas y   La parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare no retenidas sobre las primas del seguro de vida colectivo a término fijo pagadas para sus \\tex empleados.    \\xa0    Ajustes de trimestres anteriores. Si necesita corregir un ajuste declarado en un Formulario 941-PR radicado previamente, complete y radique el Formulario 941-X (PR). El Formulario 941-X (PR) se utiliza para hacer ajustes y se radica por separado del Formulario 941-PR. Vea el apartado 12 de la Pub. 179.    \\xa0 10. Total de contribuciones después de considerar los ajustes Combine las cantidades que aparecen en las líneas 6 a 9 y anote el resultado en la línea 10.   \\xa0 11.

Ajuste de la obligación contributiva para el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas declarado en la línea 11. Depositantes de itinerario mensual y depositantes de itinerario bisemanal tienen que tomar en cuenta el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas (línea 11) al declarar sus obligaciones contributivas en la línea 16 o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR). El total de la obligación contributiva del trimestre tiene que ser igual a la cantidad declarada en la línea 12. Si no se tiene en cuenta el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas en la línea 16 o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), puede causar que declare más en la línea 16 o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) que el total de la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea 12. El crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas se aplica contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios pagados correspondiente al patrono en el primer trimestre natural comenzando después de la fecha en que el pequeño negocio calificado radicó su planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos. Para completar la línea 16 o el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), usted tiene que tomar en cuenta el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina contra la obligación de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono comenzando con el primer pago de nómina para el trimestre que incluye los pagos de salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social de sus empleados. El crédito puede ser utilizado contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono sobre salarios asociados con el primer pago de nómina, y luego contra la parte de la contribución al Seguro Social correspondiente al patrono sobre salarios asociados con pagos de nómina sucesivos en el trimestre hasta que el crédito sea utilizado. No disminuya la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea 16 o su obligación contributiva diaria en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) por debajo de cero. De acuerdo con las entradas en la línea 16  o el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina se debe tener en cuenta al hacer los depósitos de las contribuciones sobre la nómina. Si se mantiene algún crédito contributivo sobre la nómina al final del trimestre que no se ha utilizado completamente porque excede la parte correspondiente al patrono de la contribución al Seguro Social para el trimestre, el crédito en exceso puede ser transferido al trimestre siguiente y permitido como un crédito contributivo sobre la nómina para el trimestre siguiente. El crédito contributivo sobre la nómina no se puede utilizar como un crédito contra la retención de la contribución federal sobre ingresos, la contribución al Medicare o la parte del empleado de la contribución al Seguro Social. Además, el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina restante no puede ser devuelto y tomado como crédito contra salarios pagados de trimestres anteriores.  Ejemplo. Rosa Co. es un patrono con un año natural contributivo que radicó oportunamente su planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos el 15 de abril de 2020. Rosa Co. eligió tomar en el Formulario 6765 el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas. El tercer trimestre de 2020 es el primer trimestre que comienza después de que Rosa Co. radicó la planilla de contribuciones sobre los ingresos haciendo la elección del crédito contributivo sobre la nómina. Por lo tanto, el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina se aplica contra la parte de Rosa Co. en la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios pagados a los empleados en el tercer trimestre de 2020. Rosa Co. es un depositante de itinerario bisemanal. Rosa Co. completa el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) reduciendo la cantidad de la obligación contributiva anotada para el primer pago de la nómina en el tercer trimestre de 2020 que incluye los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social por el menor de (1) su parte de la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios o (2) el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina disponible. Si el crédito contributivo sobre la nómina elegido es más que la parte de Rosa Co. en la contribución al Seguro Social en el primer pago de la nómina del trimestre, el crédito contributivo en exceso sobre la nómina se trasladaría a los pagos sobre la nómina sucesivos en el tercer trimestre, hasta que sea utilizado. Si la cantidad del crédito contributivo sobre la nómina excede la parte de Rosa Co. en la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios pagados a sus empleados en el tercer trimestre, el exceso de crédito se trataría como un crédito contributivo contra su parte a la contribución al Seguro Social sobre salarios pagados en el cuarto trimestre. Si la cantidad restante del crédito contributivo sobre la nómina superó la parte de Rosa Co. en la contribución al Seguro Social sobre los salarios pagados en el cuarto trimestre, podría ser transferida y ser tratada como un crédito contributivo sobre la nómina para el primer trimestre de 2021.  \\xa0   \\xa0 Parte 3: Infórmenos sobre su negocio En la Parte 3, conteste únicamente aquellas preguntas que le correspondan a su negocio. Si alguna pregunta no le corresponde, déjela en blanco y pase a la Parte 4.  \\xa0 17. Si su negocio ha dejado de operar . . . Si su negocio ha dejado de operar o si ha dejado de pagar salarios, tiene que radicar una planilla final. Para informarle al IRS que un Formulario 941-PR es su planilla final, marque el encasillado de la línea 17 y anote la última fecha en la que pagó salarios en el espacio provisto. Para leer sobre otros requisitos de la radicación, consulte Planilla final y Si cierra su negocio..., anteriormente.   \\xa0 18. Si es patrono estacional . . . Si contrata a empleados estacionales —por ejemplo, sólo para el verano o el invierno— marque el encasillado de la línea 18. El marcar el encasillado le indica al IRS que no anticipe recibir los cuatro Formularios 941-PR de usted durante el año porque no ha pagado salarios con regularidad. Por lo general, no le solicitaremos información sobre planillas no radicadas si al menos una planilla sujeta a contribuciones es radicada cada año. Sin embargo, tiene que marcar el encasillado de la línea 18 en cada Formulario 941-PR que radique. De lo contrario, el IRS esperará que se radique una planilla para cada trimestre. Además, al completar el Formulario 941-PR, asegúrese de marcar el encasillado de la parte superior de la planilla que corresponde al trimestre en que declara salarios.    \\xa0 Parte 4: ¿Podemos comunicarnos con su tercero autorizado? Si desea autorizar a algún empleado suyo, a un preparador remunerado o a otro individuo para que éste hable sobre su Formulario 941-PR con el IRS, marque el encasillado Sí en la Parte 4. Anote el nombre, número de teléfono y los cinco dígitos del número de identificación personal (PIN, por sus siglas en inglés) del individuo específico con quien podamos hablar —no el nombre de la empresa que preparó su planilla de contribución. La persona designada puede elegir cualesquier cinco dígitos para su PIN. Al marcar el encasillado Sí, usted le autoriza al IRS para que hable con el tercero designado a fin de hacerle preguntas que nos surjan al tramitar su planilla de contribución. Además, le permite a la persona designada que haga todo lo siguiente:    Facilitarnos toda información no incluida en su planilla.

La obligación total para el trimestre tiene que ser igual a la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR. Si no reporta la cantidad declarada en la línea 11 del Formulario 941-PR, puede causar que la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR sea menos que la obligación total declarada en el Anexo B. No reduzca la obligación contributiva declarada en el Anexo B a una cantidad menor que cero.       Recordatorios  Declaración de ajustes hechos a períodos anteriores.

Si se le ha impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés), quizás pueda radicar un Anexo B enmendado. Consulte el tema Cómo Corregir la Obligación Contributiva que se ha Declarado Anteriormente, más adelante.      Instrucciones Generales    Propósito del Anexo B Estas instrucciones explican el Anexo B. Para determinar si es depositante bisemanal, visite IRS.gov y escriba \"depositante de itinerario bisemanal\" en el encasillado Search (Buscar). También consulte la Publicación 179, Guía Contributiva Federal para Patronos Puertorriqueños, o la Publicación 15, Employer\\'s Tax Guide (Guía contributiva para los patronos), en inglés. La ley federal requiere que usted, como patrono, les retenga ciertas contribuciones a los cheques de salario de sus empleados. Cada vez que paga salarios, tiene que retener —es decir, descontar de los cheques de salario de sus empleados— ciertas cantidades para pagar la contribución al Seguro Social y la contribución al Medicare. También tiene que retener la Contribución Adicional al Medicare de los salarios en exceso de $200,000 que le paga a un empleado en un año natural. De acuerdo con el sistema de la retención de contribuciones, estas mismas que se les retienen a sus empleados se acreditarán en sus cuentas del Seguro Social para pagar sus obligaciones contributivas correspondientes. La ley federal también requiere que los patronos paguen toda obligación de la parte de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare que les corresponde. No se les retiene a los empleados esta parte de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Indique su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B para cada día. Incluya las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare del patrono y del empleado. No use el Anexo B para declarar depósitos de la contribución federal. El Servicio Federal de Rentas Internas (IRS, por sus siglas en inglés) obtiene toda la información relacionada con los depósitos mediante el retiro electrónico de fondos.    El IRS usa el Anexo B para determinar si usted ha depositado a tiempo sus obligaciones contributivas federales sobre la nómina. Si no llena y radica correctamente su Anexo B junto con el Formulario 941-PR, el IRS podrá proponer una multa FTD\"promediada\". Vea Multas relacionadas con los depósitos, en el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información.     ¿Quién Tiene Que Radicar el Anexo B? Radique el Anexo B si usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal. Usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal si sus contribuciones del período retroactivo ascienden a más de $50,000 o acumula una obligación contributiva de $100,000 o más en cualquier día del año natural en curso o el previo. Vea el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información.    No complete el Anexo B si tiene una obligación contributiva menor de $2,500 durante el trimestre.     ¿Cuándo Tiene Que Radicar? El Anexo B acompaña al Formulario 941-PR, Planilla para la Declaración Federal TRIMESTRAL del Patrono. Por lo tanto, la fecha de vencimiento del Anexo B es la misma fecha de vencimiento del Formulario 941-PR correspondiente. No radique el Anexo B como documento adjunto al Formulario 944(SP), Declaración Federal ANUAL de Impuestos del Patrono o Empleador. En vez de eso, si es depositante de itinerario bisemanal que tiene que radicar un registro de la obligación contributiva con el Formulario 944(SP), use el Formulario 943A-PR, Registro de la Obligación Contributiva Federal del Patrono Agrícola, o el Formulario 945-A, Annual Record of Federal Tax Liability (Registro anual de la obligación de impuestos federales), en inglés.    Instrucciones Específicas    Cómo Completar el Anexo B    Provea la Información de su Negocio Escriba su número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés) y su nombre en la parte superior del anexo. Asegúrese de que los mismos correspondan exactamente al nombre del negocio y al EIN que el IRS le asignó y también concuerden con el nombre y el EIN indicados en el Formulario 941-PR adjunto.     Año Natural Anote el año natural que corresponde al trimestre seleccionado.     Marque el Recuadro para el Trimestre Marque en la parte superior del Anexo B, bajo Informe para este trimeste, el recuadro apropiado del trimestre para el cual radica este anexo. Asegúrese de que el trimestre marcado en la parte superior del Anexo B corresponda exactamente al trimestre marcado en su Formulario 941-PR.     Anote su Obligación Contributiva para cada Mes El Anexo B se divide en los 3 meses que constituyen un trimestre típico de un año. Cada mes tiene 31 espacios enumerados que corresponden a las fechas de un mes típico. Anote sus obligaciones contributivas en los espacios que corresponden a las fechas en las cuales pagó salarios a sus empleados, y no en la fecha en la que se hicieron los depósitos correspondientes a la nómina. Por ejemplo, si su período de nómina terminó el 31 de diciembre de 2016 y pagó los salarios correspondientes a tal período el 6 de enero de 2017, usted:   Comenzaría con el Mes 1 (porque enero es el primer mes del trimestre) y Anotaría la obligación contributiva correspondiente en la línea 6 (porque la línea 6 representa el sexto día del mes).       Asegúrese de que marcó el recuadro apropiado en la Parte 2 del Formulario 941-PR para indicar que usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal.     Obligación Total para el Trimestre Para determinar su obligación total para el trimestre, sume sus obligaciones contributivas de cada mes.            Obligación Contributiva del Mes 1     + Obligación Contributiva del Mes 2     +  Obligación Contributiva del Mes 3        Obligación Contributiva Total del Trimestre            Su obligación total para el trimestre tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR.      Ejemplo 1. El Patrono A es depositante de itinerario bisemanal que paga los salarios mensuales el último día del mes. El 24 de diciembre de 2017, el Patrono A también pagó a sus empleados las bonificaciones de fin de año (sujetas a las contribuciones sobre la nómina). Debido a que el Patrono A es depositante de itinerario bisemanal, el mismo tiene que informar sus obligaciones para las contribuciones sobre la nómina en el Anexo B. Para el cuarto trimestre (octubre, noviembre y diciembre), el Patrono A tiene que declarar su obligación contributiva de la manera siguiente:           Mes   Líneas de las fechas en las que se pagaron salarios          1 (octubre) línea 31 (día de pago, último día del mes)   2 (noviembre) línea 30 (día de pago, último día del mes)   3 (diciembre)  línea 24 (bonificaciones pagadas el 24 de diciembre de 2017)    3 (diciembre) línea 31 (día de pago, último día del mes)              Ejemplo 2. El Patrono B es un depositante de itinerario bisemanal que paga los salarios a sus empleados cada viernes alterno. El Patrono B acumuló una obligación de contribuciones sobre la nómina de $20,000 en cada una de las siguientes fechas de pago: 01/06/17, 01/20/17, 02/03/17, 02/17/17, 03/03/17, 03/17/17 y 03/31/17. Ya que el Patrono B es depositante de itinerario bisemanal, el Patrono B tiene que declarar su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B de la manera siguiente:           Mes   Líneas de las fechas en las que se pagaron salarios          1 (enero) líneas 6 y 20    2 (febrero) líneas 3 y 17    3 (marzo)  líneas 3, 17 y 31               Ejemplo 3. El Patrono C tiene un negocio nuevo y es depositante de itinerario mensual para 2017. El Patrono C paga los salarios a sus empleados todos los viernes y ha acumulado una obligación contributiva sobre la nómina de $2,000 el 01/13/17. El 01/20/17, y cada uno de los viernes subsiguientes durante 2017, el Patrono C acumuló una obligación contributiva sobre la nómina de $110,000. De acuerdo con las reglas de depósito, los patronos se convierten en depositantes de itinerario bisemanal el día después de cualquier día en el que acumulan $100,000 o más por concepto de obligación contributiva sobre la nómina durante un período de depósito. El Patrono C acumuló $112,000 el 01/20/17, el mismo se convirtió en depositante de itinerario bisemanal el día siguiente (01/21/17). Vea el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información. El Patrono C tiene que completar el Anexo B y radicarlo junto con el Formulario 941-PR como se muestra abajo.            Mes   Fechas en las cuales se pagaron los salarios   Cantidad que se debe declarar              1 (enero)  línea 13  $2,000     1 (enero)  líneas 20 y 27  $110,000     2 (febrero)  líneas 3, 10, 17 y 24  $110,000     3 (marzo)  líneas 3, 10, 17, 24 y 31  $110,000                       Cómo Corregir la Obligación Contributiva que se ha Declarado Anteriormente  Depositantes de itinerario bisemanal.  Si se le ha impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) correspondiente a un trimestre y cometió un error en el Anexo B y la corrección no cambiará el total de la obligación contributiva para el trimestre que declaró en el Anexo B, quizás pueda reducir la multa si radica un Anexo B corregido.    Ejemplo. Usted declaró $3,000 de obligación contributiva el día 1 del mes 1. Sin embargo, la obligación contributiva realmente corresponde al mes 3. Prepare un Anexo B enmendado que indique los $3,000 de obligación contributiva en el día 1 del mes 3. Además, tiene que anotar las obligaciones contributivas que había declarado anteriormente para el trimestre que no cambiaron. Escriba \"Enmendado\" en la parte superior del Anexo B. El IRS volverá a calcular la multa y le notificará de todo cambio a la multa.   Depositantes de itinerario mensual.  Los depositantes de itinerario mensual pueden radicar un Anexo B si se les ha impuesto una multa FTD correspondiente a un trimestre y cometieron un error en la parte para contribuciones mensuales del Formulario 941-PR. Cuando complete el Anexo B, debe anotar los totales mensuales porque no se requieren las anotaciones diarias.    Dónde debe radicar.  Radique su Anexo B enmendado en la dirección indicada en la notificación que recibió sobre la multa. No tiene que incluir el Anexo B original.      Formulario 941-X (PR)  Reducción en las contribuciones.  Si va a radicar un Formulario 941-X (PR) correspondiente a un trimestre, puede radicar el Anexo B enmendado junto con el Formulario 941-X (PR) si las dos condiciones siguientes le corresponden:  Tiene una reducción en las contribuciones. Le impusieron una multa FTD.    Radique su Anexo B enmendado junto con el Formulario 941-X (PR). La obligación contributiva total para el trimestre declarada en su Anexo B corregido tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de contribuciones corregida declarada en el Formulario 941-X (PR). Si su multa se reduce, el IRS incluirá la reducción de la multa junto con su reducción en las contribuciones.    Aumento en las contribuciones — Formulario941-X (PR) radicado a tiempo.  Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) a tiempo, no radique un Anexo B enmendado, a menos que se le haya impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) debido a un Anexo B que falta (que no ha sido radicado anteriormente), que está incorrecto o que está incompleto. No incluya la cantidad de aumento en la contribución declarada en el Formulario 941-X (PR) en ningún Anexo B enmendado que usted radique.    Aumento en las contribuciones — Formulario941-X (PR) radicado fuera de plazo.  Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) fuera de plazo, o sea, después de la fecha de vencimiento para el trimestre en el que usted descubrió el error, tiene que radicar un Anexo B enmendado con el Formulario 941-X (PR). De otro modo, el IRS podría tasarle una multa \"promediada\" por no depositar. El total de la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea Obligación total para el trimestre del Anexo B enmendado tiene que ser igual a la cantidad total de contribuciones (línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR (línea 10 para trimestres que terminaron antes del 1 de enero de 2017) combinado con cualquier corrección declarada en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.      El Formulario 941-X (PR) será revisado en abril de 2017. Si utiliza la revisión de abril de 2017, la contribución total declarada en la línea Obligación total para el trimestre del Anexo B tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de la contribución corregida (línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR (línea 10 para trimestres que terminaron antes del 1 de enero de 2017) combinada con toda corrección declarada en la línea 19 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.

       " '   Instructions for Schedule B (Form 941) (01/2017) Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule Depositors  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 01/2017      Instructions for Schedule B (Form 941) - Introductory Material    Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Schedule B and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/form941.     What’s New  Adjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities.  You must account for any qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities that you reported on Form 941 or Form 941-SS, line 11, when reporting your liabilities on Schedule B. The total liability for the quarter must equal Form 941 or Form 941-SS, line 12. Failure to account for the amount reported on Form 941 or Form 941-SS, line 11, may cause Form 941 or Form 941-SS, line 12, to be less than the total tax liability reported on Schedule B. Don\\'t reduce tax liability reported on Schedule B below zero.       Reminders  Reporting prior period adjustments.  Prior period adjustments are reported on Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, or Form 944-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, and aren’t taken into account when figuring the tax liability for the current quarter. When you file Schedule B with your Form 941 (or Form 941-SS), don’t change your tax liability by adjustments reported on any Form 941-X or 944-X.    Amended Schedule B.  If you have been assessed a failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalty, you may be able to file an amended Schedule B. See Correcting Previously Reported Tax Liability, later.      General Instructions    Purpose of Schedule B These instructions tell you about Schedule B. To determine if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, visit IRS.gov and type \"semiweekly depositor\" in the search box. Also see Pub. 15, Employer\\'s Tax Guide, or Pub. 80, Federal Tax Guide for Employers in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Federal law requires you, as an employer, to withhold certain taxes from your employees’ pay. Each time you pay wages, you must withhold - or take out of your employees’ pay - certain amounts for federal income tax, social security tax, and Medicare tax. You must also withhold Additional Medicare Tax from wages you pay to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. Under the withholding system, taxes withheld from your employees are credited to your employees in payment of their tax liabilities.  Federal law also requires employers to pay any liability for the employer\\'s portion of social security and Medicare taxes. This portion of social security and Medicare taxes isn’t withheld from employees. On Schedule B, list your tax liability for each day. Your liability includes:  The federal income tax you withheld from your employees\\'   pay, and Both employee and employer social security and Medicare   taxes.    Don’t use the Schedule B to show federal tax deposits. The IRS gets deposit data from electronic funds transfers.    The IRS uses Schedule B to determine if you’ve deposited your federal employment tax liabilities on time. If you don’t properly complete and file your Schedule B with Form 941 or Form 941-SS, the IRS may propose an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. See Deposit Penalties in section 11 of Pub. 15 for more information.     Who Must File?  File Schedule B if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor. You’re a semiweekly depositor if you reported more than $50,000 of employment taxes in the lookback period or accumulated a tax liability of $100,000 or more on any given day in the current or prior calendar year. See section 11 of Pub. 15 for more information.    Don’t complete Schedule B if you have a tax liability that is less than $2,500 during the quarter.     When Must You File? Schedule B is filed with Form 941, Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, or Form 941-SS, Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Therefore, the due date of Schedule B is the same as the due date for the applicable Form 941 or Form 941-SS. Don’t file Schedule B as an attachment to Form 944, Employer\\'s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return. Instead, if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor that is required to file a report of tax liability with Form 944, use Form 945-A, Annual Record of Federal Tax Liability.    Specific Instructions    Completing Schedule B    Enter Your Business Information Carefully enter your employer identification number (EIN) and name at the top of the schedule. Make sure that they exactly match the name of your business and the EIN that the IRS assigned to your business and also agree with the name and EIN shown on the attached Form 941 or Form 941-SS.     Calendar Year Enter the calendar year that applies to the quarter checked.      Check the Box for the Quarter Under Report for this Quarter at the top of Schedule B, check the appropriate box of the quarter for which you’re filing this schedule. Make sure the quarter checked on the top of the Schedule B matches the quarter checked on your Form 941 or Form 941-SS.     Enter Your Tax Liability by Month Schedule B is divided into the 3 months that make up a quarter of a year. Each month has 31 numbered spaces that correspond to the dates of a typical month. Enter your tax liabilities in the spaces that correspond to the dates you paid wages to your employees, not the date payroll deposits were made. For example, if your payroll period ended on December 31, 2016, and you paid the wages for that period on January 6, 2017, you would:  Go to Month 1 (because January is the first month of the   quarter), and Enter your tax liability on line 6 (because line 6 represents   the sixth day of the month).       Make sure you have checked the appropriate box in Part 2 of Form 941 or Form 941-SS to show that you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.      Total Liability for the Quarter To find your total liability for the quarter, add your monthly tax liabilities.            Tax Liability for Month 1       +Tax Liability for Month 2        +Tax Liability for Month 3         Total Liability for the Quarter            Your total liability for the quarter must equal line 12 on Form 941 or Form 941-SS.        Example 1. Employer A is a semiweekly schedule depositor who pays wages for each month on the last day of the month. On December 24, 2017, Employer A also paid its employees year-end bonuses (subject to employment taxes). Employer A must report employment tax liabilities on Schedule B for the 4th quarter (October, November, December), as follows.           Month   Lines for dates wages were paid    1 (October) line 31 (pay day, last day of the month)   2 (November) line 30 (pay day, last day of the month)   3 (December) line 24 (bonus paid December 24, 2017)   3 (December)  line 31 (pay day, last day of the month)          Example 2. Employer B is a semiweekly schedule depositor who pays employees every other Friday. Employer B accumulated a $20,000 employment tax liability on each of these pay dates: 01/06/17, 01/20/17, 02/03/17, 02/17/17, 03/03/17, 03/17/17, and 03/31/17. Employer B must report employment tax liabilities on Schedule B as follows.           Month   Lines for dates wages were paid    1 (January) lines 6 and 20   2 (February) lines 3 and 17   3 (March)  lines 3, 17, and 31          Example 3. Employer C is a new business and monthly schedule depositor for 2017. Employer C paid wages every Friday and accumulated a $2,000 employment tax liability on 01/13/17. On 01/20/17, and on every subsequent Friday during 2017, Employer C accumulated a $110,000 employment tax liability. Under the deposit rules, employers become semiweekly schedule depositors on the day after any day they accumulate $100,000 or more of employment tax liability in a deposit period. Employer C became a semiweekly schedule depositor on 01/21/17, because Employer C had a total accumulated employment tax liability of $112,000 on 01/20/17. For more information, see section 11 of Pub. 15 or section 8 of Pub. 80. Employer C must complete Schedule B as shown below and file it with Form 941 or 941-SS.             Month   Lines for dates wages were paid   Amount to report    1 (January) line 13 $2,000     1 (January) lines 20, 27 $110,000     2 (February) lines 3, 10, 17, and 24 $110,000     3 (March) lines 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31 $110,000             Correcting Previously Reported Tax Liability  Semiweekly schedule depositors.  If you’ve been assessed an FTD penalty for a quarter and you made an error on Schedule B and the correction won’t change the total liability for the quarter you reported on Schedule B, you may be able to reduce your penalty by filing a corrected Schedule B.    Example. You reported a liability of $3,000 on day 1 of month 1. However, the liability was actually for month 3. Prepare an amended Schedule B showing the $3,000 liability on day 1 of month 3. Also, you must enter the liabilities previously reported for the quarter that didn’t change. Write \"Amended\" at the top of Schedule B. The IRS will refigure the penalty and notify you of any change in the penalty.   Monthly schedule depositors.  You can file a Schedule B if you have been assessed an FTD penalty for a quarter and you made an error on the monthly tax liability section of Form 941. When completing Schedule B, only enter the monthly totals. The daily entries aren’t required.    Where to file.  File your amended Schedule B at the address provided in the penalty notice you received. You don’t have to submit your original Schedule B.       Form 941-X  Tax decrease.  If you’re filing Form 941-X for a quarter, you can file an amended Schedule B with Form 941-X if both of the following apply.  You have a tax decrease. You were assessed an FTD penalty.  File your amended Schedule B with Form 941-X. The total liability for the quarter reported on your corrected Schedule B must equal the corrected amount of tax reported on Form 941-X. If your penalty is decreased, the IRS will include the penalty decrease with your tax decrease.    Tax increase — Form 941-X filed timely.  If you’re filing a timely Form 941-X, don’t file an amended Schedule B, unless you were assessed an FTD penalty caused by an incorrect, incomplete, or missing Schedule B. If you’re filing an amended Schedule B, don’t include the tax increase reported on Form 941-X.    Tax increase — Form 941-X filed late.  If you owe tax and are filing a late Form 941-X, that is, after the due date of the return for the return period in which you discovered the error, you must file an amended Schedule B with Form 941-X. Otherwise, the IRS may assess an \"averaged\" FTD penalty.   The total tax reported on the \"Total liability for the quarter\" line of the amended Schedule B must match the corrected tax (Form 941, line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017), combined with any correction reported on Form 941-X, line 18) for the quarter, less any previous abatements and interest-free tax assessments.     Form 941-X will be revised in April 2017. If you are using the April 2017 revision, the total tax reported on the \"Total liability for the quarter\" line of the amended Schedule B must match the corrected tax (Form 941, line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017), combined with any correction reported on Form 941-X, line 19) for the quarter, less any previous abatements and interest-free tax assessments.

       " '   Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) (06/2011) Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 06/2011     General Instructions    Understanding Schedule D (Form 941) These instructions tell you about Schedule D (Form 941), Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations. Employers can use Schedule D (Form 941), to explain certain discrepancies (caused by acquisitions, statutory mergers, and consolidations) between Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (Copy A), and Forms 941, Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, for the totals of social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance earned income credit (EIC) payments (for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).    What Is Schedule D (Form 941)? Each year the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) compare the totals on your Forms 941 with the totals from your Forms W-2 (Copy A), to verify the following.  The wages you reported on Forms 941 match those you reported on Forms W-2 (Copy A) so that your employees\\' social security earnings records are complete for benefit purposes. You have paid the appropriate taxes.    Generally, the totals of all your Forms W-2 (Copy A) should equal the aggregate quarterly totals you reported on Forms 941. Use Schedule D (Form 941) if discrepancies exist between the totals you reported on those forms only as a result of an acquisition, statutory merger, or consolidation.    IRS uses Schedule D (Form 941) to determine if you have reported your wages and tax liabilities correctly. In many cases, the information on Schedule D (Form 941) helps the IRS resolve discrepancies without contacting you.     Who Should File Schedule D (Form 941)? You do not need to file a Schedule D (Form 941) for every merger, acquisition, or other reorganization that occurs. File Schedule D (Form 941) only for those acquisitions, statutory mergers or consolidations that create discrepancies between Forms W-2 (Copy A) and Forms 941 in the totals of:  Social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, Social security tips, Federal income tax withheld, and Advance EIC payments (for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).        Each party to an applicable transaction (see below) files its own Schedule D (Form 941).    File Schedule D (Form 941) for:    A statutory merger, A consolidation, or An acquisition for which you are using the alternate procedure under Rev. Proc. 2004-53. See Rev. Proc. 2004-53, 2004-34 I.R.B. 320, available at  www.irs.gov/irb/2004–34_IRB/ar13.html.        Do NOT file a Schedule D for:    An acquisition for which you are using the standard procedure under Rev. Proc. 2004-53, or An acquisition that is not a statutory merger or consolidation and that does not qualify under the predecessor-successor rules. See Acquisitions that Qualify Under Predecessor-Successor Rules, on page 2, for a complete discussion of the predecessor-successor rules.        Types of Mergers and Acquisitions Mergers, acquisitions, and other reorganizations generally fall into one of three categories for purposes of reporting employment taxes.  Statutory mergers and consolidations. Acquisitions that qualify under the predecessor-successor rules (see Acquisitions that Qualify Under Predecessor-Successor Rules on page 2). Other acquisitions that are not statutory mergers or consolidations and that do not qualify under the predecessor-successor rules (see Acquisitions that Qualify Under the Predecessor-Successor Rules on  page 2).        Statutory Mergers and Consolidations If you are the surviving corporation after a statutory merger or consolidation, you should file Schedule D (Form 941) to provide:  The date of the statutory merger or consolidation; The name, trade name (doing business as or d/b/a), address, and employer identification number (EIN) of the acquired corporation; and An explanation of any discrepancies between Forms W-2 (Copy A) and Forms 941 in the totals of social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance EIC payments (only for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).    If you are the acquired corporation after a statutory merger or consolidation and you are filing a final Form 941, you should file Schedule D (Form 941) to provide:  The date of the statutory merger or consolidation; The name, trade name (doing business as or d/b/a), address, and EIN of the surviving corporation; and An explanation of any discrepancies between Forms W-2 (Copy A) and Forms 941 in the totals of social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance EIC payments (only for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).    Rev. Rul. 62-60, 1962-1 C.B. 186, provides that, for employment tax purposes, the \"resultant\" corporation (now called a \"surviving\" corporation) resulting from a statutory merger or consolidation is the same employer and taxpayer as the \"absorbed\" corporation (now called an \"acquired\" corporation). The predecessor-successor rules described in Rev. Proc. 2004-53 do not apply to these transactions. However, Rev. Proc. 2004-53 provides guidance for using Schedule D (Form 941) by a surviving corporation or an acquired corporation to report information after a statutory merger or consolidation only where there is a discrepancy. If the surviving corporation completes and files Schedule D (Form 941) to explain discrepancies between the totals on Forms W-2 (Copy A) and the totals on Forms 941, filing Schedule D (Form 941) will also provide notice of a statutory merger or consolidation under Rev. Rul. 62-60.     Acquisitions that Qualify Under the Predecessor-Successor Rules Acquisitions that qualify under the predecessor-successor rules are acquisitions in which a successor employer:  Acquires substantially all the property used in a trade or business of another employer (predecessor) or in a separate unit of a trade or business of a predecessor, and In connection with and directly after the acquisition (but during the same calendar year) employs individuals who immediately before the acquisition were employed in the trade or business of the predecessor.    These acquisitions satisfy the conditions for predecessor-successor status set forth in section 3121(a)(1) and Regulations section 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b). Rev. Proc. 2004-53 contains the rules that apply to employment tax reporting in a predecessor-successor situation. Two procedures can be used in an acquisition that qualifies as a predecessor-successor situation.   Standard procedure—Do not file Schedule D (Form 941). No discrepancies should exist between the totals of the Forms W-2 (Copy A) and the totals of the Forms 941 as a result of the acquisition.  Alternate procedure—Each party in the transaction should file Schedule D (Form 941). Forms W-2 (Copy A) filed by the successor may include amounts reported on Forms 941 filed by the predecessor.        Other Acquisitions If you completed other acquisitions that are not statutory mergers or consolidations and that do not qualify under the predecessor-successor rules, no discrepancies should exist as a result of the acquisition. Rev. Rul. 62-60 and Rev. Proc. 2004-53 do not apply to such transactions. Do not file Schedule D (Form 941) for such transactions.      When Should You File? If your business is continuing to operate, you should file Schedule D (Form 941) with your Form 941 no later than the due date of your Form 941 for the first quarter of the year after the calendar year of the transaction. If your business is not continuing to operate, you should file Schedule D (Form 941) with your final Form 941. For example, if the transaction occurred in the third quarter of 2010 and your business is continuing to operate, you would file Schedule D (Form 941) with your Form 941 no later than the due date for the first quarter of 2011. However, if your business is not continuing to operate during 2010, you would file Schedule D (Form 941) with your final Form 941 no later than the due date for the third quarter of 2010.     How Should You File? Schedule D (Form 941) was designed to be filed electronically with your electronic submission of Form 941. Electronic filing of Schedule D (Form 941) enables IRS to process information on the form more efficiently and accurately. However, you may file Schedule D (Form 941) on paper if necessary. When filing on paper, do not attach Schedule D (Form 941) to your Form 941. Instead, file Schedule D (Form 941) separately using the following address.  IRS Philadelphia Campus Mail Stop 4-G08 151 2970 Market Street Philadelphia, PA 19104   Do not use this address to file Form 941. See Where Should You File? in the Instructions for Form 941 for the filing address of Form 941.     Specific Instructions    Completing Schedule D (Form 941)    Your Business Information Carefully fill in your employer identification number (EIN), name, trade name (doing business as or d/b/a), and complete address at the top of the schedule.    Always be sure the EIN on the Schedule D (Form 941) you file exactly matches the EIN the IRS assigned to your business.     Tax Year of Discrepancies In the box at the top of the schedule, write the tax year (not the quarter) in which the discrepancies occurred. Write the tax year using four digits. For example, if the transaction occurred on March 22, 2011, write \"2011\" in the box. Make sure you fill in the correct tax year so you can reconcile the information appropriately. The tax year must be the same as the calendar year you write in Part 1, line 2.    Be sure to fill in your EIN, business name, other party\\'s EIN, and the tax year of the discrepancies on the top of page 2 as well.     Type of Submission Check the appropriate box to show whether this form is the \"Original\" Schedule D (Form 941) for a specific transaction or corrects (mark \"Corrected\") a Schedule D (Form 941) you previously submitted.      Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) - Notices    Part 1: Answer these background questions     Check the appropriate box to explain the type of transaction for which you are submitting Schedule D (Form 941). See Types of Mergers and Acquisitions on page 1 for details. File Schedule D (Form 941) after either:  A statutory merger or consolidation (Check whether you are an acquired corporation or a surviving corporation.), or An acquisition for which you are using the alternate procedure under Rev. Proc. 2004-53. (Check whether you are a predecessor or a successor.)   Fill in the effective date of the transaction in the box. Make sure you write the month, day, and year in this format: MM/DD/YYYY. The year must be the same as the calendar year you write in the box at the top of the schedule. Fill in the contact information about the OTHER PARTY in the transaction by including the other party\\'s EIN, name, trade name (doing business as or d/b/a), complete address, and phone number. Verify the other party\\'s EIN to make sure it is correct.        Part 2: Tell us about the discrepancies with your returns  Lines 4–8. Gather your information about the social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance earned income credit (EIC) payments (for tax years ending before January 1, 2011) you reported. When entering money amounts from your Forms 941 and W-2 (Copy A) on lines 4–14, you may round to the nearest dollar. Do not show dollar signs but do use commas as appropriate. Show an amount (even if it is zero) for each column of a line. In Column A, fill in the amount you reported to the IRS for the tax year for each of the items. Add the totals from all Forms 941, as corrected by any Forms 941-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, and write your answers on the appropriate lines. In Column B, fill in the amount you reported to SSA for each of the items. Add the totals from all Forms W-2 (Copy A), as corrected by any Forms W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement (Copy A), and write your answers on the appropriate lines. Calculate the differences between the entries in the columns:               Column A        –   Column B            Column C                 Enter any negative result in parentheses, if possible. For example, if line 6, Column A is \"-0-\" and line 6, Column B is \"6,000,\" write \"(6,000)\" on line 6, Column C.    If no Forms W-2 (Copy A) were filed by you, write \"-0-\" in Column B, \"Amount you reported to SSA for the tax year.\"           If you are filing for one transaction only, stop here. If you are filing for more than one transaction, go to Part 3.     Part 3: Fill this part out ONLY if you are filing more than one Schedule D (Form 941) for any calendar year If you are filing only one Schedule D (Form 941) for the calendar year, leave this part blank. When more than one statutory merger, consolidation, or acquisition occurs during a calendar year, file a separate Schedule D (Form 941) for each transaction. Complete Part 3 for each transaction. For instance, if you have 11 different transactions in a calendar year, you need to file 11 different Schedules D (Form 941). Part 2 would be the same for each schedule. Part 3 would show one of the 11 transactions. For example, the amount entered in Part 2 on line 4 for Column C should equal the total of all 11 entries in Part 3 on line 10 for Column C.  Line 9.  Show the number of schedules you are filing for the year and identify which schedule this is. For example, if you had three different transactions in a calendar year and you are filing a Schedule D (Form 941) to describe the second transaction, fill in \"2\" and \"3\" so the sentence reads: \"This is schedule 2 of 3. \"                 Lines 10–14.  For purposes of Part 3, Columns A and B, the term \"employees affected by the transaction reported on this Schedule D\" means those employees who received wages that were reported on Forms 941 filed by one employer but whose wages were reported on Form W-2 (Copy A) filed by another employer as a result of this particular transaction. Report the totals for social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance earned income credit (EIC) payments (for tax years ending before January 1, 2011).    In Column A, fill in the amount you reported to the IRS for the tax year for employees affected by the transaction reported on this Schedule D (Form 941) for each of the items. Add the totals from all your Forms 941, as corrected by any Forms 941-X, and write your answers on the appropriate lines. In Column B, fill in the amount you reported to SSA for the tax year for employees affected by the transaction reported on this Schedule D (Form 941) for each of the items. Add the totals from all Forms W-2 (Copy A), as corrected by any Forms W-2c (Copy A), and write your answers on the appropriate lines. Calculate the differences between the entries in the columns:               Column A        –   Column B            Column C                 Enter any negative result in parentheses, if possible. For example, if line 12, Column A is \"-0-\" and line 12, Column B is \"6,000,\" write \"(6,000)\" on line 12, Column C.    If no Forms W-2 (Copy A) were filed by you, write \"-0-\" in Column B, \"Amount you reported to SSA for the tax year.\"              Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) - Notices    Part 1: Answer these background questions     Check the appropriate box to explain the type of transaction for which you are submitting Schedule D (Form 941).

       " '   Instructions for Form 941-SS (01/2020)  Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return—American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 01/2020        Instructions for Form 941-SS - Introductory Material       Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 941-SS and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form941SS.   \\xa0 What\\'s New  Social security and Medicare tax for 2020. The social security tax rate is 6.2% each for the employee and employer, unchanged from 2019. The social security wage base limit is $137,700. The Medicare tax rate is 1.45% each for the employee and employer, unchanged from 2019. There is no wage base limit for Medicare tax. Social security and Medicare taxes apply to the wages of household workers you pay $2,200 or more in cash wages in 2020. Social security and Medicare taxes apply to election workers who are paid $1,900 or more in cash or an equivalent form of compensation in 2020.    \\xa0 Reminders  Qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities. For tax years beginning after 2015, a qualified small business may elect to claim up to $250,000 of its credit for increasing research activities as a payroll tax credit against the employer share of social security tax. The payroll tax credit must be elected on an original income tax return that is timely filed (including extensions). The portion of the credit used against the employer share of social security tax is allowed in the first calendar quarter beginning after the date that the qualified small business filed its income tax return. The election and determination of the credit amount that will be used against the employer share of social security tax are made on Form 6765, Credit for Increasing Research Activities. The amount from Form 6765, line 44, must then be reported on Form 8974, Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities. Form 8974 is used to determine the amount of the credit that can be used in the current quarter. The amount from Form 8974, line 12, is reported on Form 941-SS, line 11. If you’re claiming the research payroll tax credit on your Form 941-SS, you must attach Form 8974 to that Form 941-SS. For more information about the payroll tax credit, see Notice 2017-23, 2017-16 I.R.B. 1100, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-16_IRB#NOT-2017-23 and IRS.gov/ResearchPayrollTC. Also see Adjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities reported on line 11, later.   Certification program for professional employer organizations (PEOs). The Stephen Beck, Jr., ABLE Act of 2014 required the IRS to establish a voluntary certification program for PEOs. PEOs handle various payroll administration and tax reporting responsibilities for their business clients and are typically paid a fee based on payroll costs. To become and remain certified under the certification program, certified professional employer organizations (CPEOs) must meet various requirements described in sections 3511 and 7705 and related published guidance. Certification as a CPEO may affect the employment tax liabilities of both the CPEO and its customers. A CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer of any individual who performs services for a customer of the CPEO and is covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between the CPEO and the customer (CPEO contract), but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System. For more information or to apply to become a CPEO, go to IRS.gov/CPEO. CPEOs generally must file Form 941-SS and Schedule R (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers, electronically. For more information about a CPEO’s requirement to file electronically, see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.   Outsourcing payroll duties. Generally, as an employer, you\\'re responsible to ensure that tax returns are filed and deposits and payments are made, even if you contract with a third party to perform these acts. You remain responsible if the third party fails to perform any required action. Before you choose to outsource any of your payroll and related tax duties (that is, withholding, reporting, and paying over social security, Medicare, FUTA, and income taxes) to a third-party payer, such as a payroll service provider or reporting agent, go to IRS.gov/OutsourcingPayrollDuties. If a CPEO pays wages and other compensation to an individual performing services for you, and the services are covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between you and the CPEO (CPEO contract), then the CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer, but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. However, with respect to certain employees covered by a CPEO contract, you may also be treated as an employer of the employees and, consequently, may also be liable for federal employment taxes imposed on wages and other compensation paid by the CPEO to such employees. For more information on the different types of third-party payer arrangements, see section 16 in Pub. 15.   Aggregate Form 941-SS filers. Agents and CPEOs must complete Schedule R (Form 941) when filing an aggregate Form 941-SS. Aggregate Forms 941-SS are filed by agents approved by the IRS under section 3504. To request approval to act as an agent for an employer, the agent files Form 2678 with the IRS unless you’re a state or local government agency acting as an agent under the special procedures provided in Rev. Proc. 2013-39, 2013-52 I.R.B. 830, available at IRS.gov/irb/2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39. Aggregate Forms 941-SS are also filed by CPEOs approved by the IRS under section 7705. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System at IRS.gov/CPEO. CPEOs file Form 8973, Certified Professional Employer Organization/Customer Reporting Agreement, to notify the IRS that they started or ended a service contract with a customer. CPEOs generally must file Form 941-SS and Schedule R (Form 941) electronically. For more information about a CPEO’s requirement to file electronically, see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.   \\xa0 If both an employer and a section 3504 authorized agent paid wages to an employee during a quarter, or if both an employer and a CPEO paid wages to an employee during a quarter, both the employer and the section 3504 authorized agent (or the CPEO, if applicable) should file Form 941 or Form 941-SS, as appropriate, reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the applicable quarter and issue Forms W-2, W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, or W-2VI, as appropriate, reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the year.  Work opportunity tax credit for qualified tax-exempt organizations hiring qualified veterans. Qualified tax-exempt organizations that hire eligible unemployed veterans may be able to claim the work opportunity tax credit against their payroll tax liability using Form 5884-C. For more information, go to IRS.gov/WOTC.   COBRA premium assistance credit. Effective for tax periods beginning after 2013, the credit for COBRA premium assistance payments can\\'t be claimed on Form 941-SS. Instead, after filing your Form 941-SS, file Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit. Filing a Form 941-X before filing a Form 941-SS for the quarter may result in errors or delays in processing your Form 941-X. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 941-X.  \\xa0 If you’re entitled to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit, but aren\\'t otherwise required to file Form 941-SS, file a Form 941-SS with -0- entered on line 14 before filing a Form 941-X to claim the credit.    Correcting a previously filed Form 941-SS. If you discover an error on a previously filed Form 941-SS, make the correction using Form 941-X. Form 941-X is filed separately from Form 941-SS. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 941-X, section 9 of Pub. 80, or go to IRS.gov/CorrectingEmploymentTaxes.   Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT). You must use EFT to make all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). If you don\\'t want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your behalf. Also, you may arrange for your financial institution to initiate a same-day wire payment on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of the Treasury. Services provided by your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other third party may have a fee. For more information on making federal tax deposits, see section 8 of Pub. 80. To get more information about EFTPS or to enroll in EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov or call one of the following numbers.    800-555-4477 (toll free; for use by U.S. Virgin Islands only).   800-733-4829 (TDD).   800-244-4829 (Spanish).   303-967-5916 (toll call).    \\xa0 Additional information about EFTPS is available in Pub. 966.  \\xa0 For an EFTPS deposit to be on time, you must submit the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date the deposit is due. See section 8 of Pub. 80 for details.  \\xa0 Same-day wire payment option. If you fail to submit a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Collection Service (FTCS) to make a same-day wire payment. To use the same-day wire payment method, you will need to make arrangements with your financial institution ahead of time. Please check with your financial institution regarding availability, deadlines, and costs. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for payments made this way. To learn more about the information you will need to give your financial institution to make a same-day wire payment, go to IRS.gov/SameDayWire.   \\xa0 Timeliness of federal tax deposits. If a deposit is required to be made on a day that isn\\'t a business day, the deposit is considered timely if it is made by the close of the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The term \"legal holiday\" for deposit purposes includes only those legal holidays in the District of Columbia. Legal holidays in the District of Columbia are provided in section 8 of Pub. 80.    Electronic filing and payment. Businesses can enjoy the benefits of filing and paying their federal taxes electronically. Whether you rely on a tax professional or handle your own taxes, the IRS offers you convenient programs to make filing and paying easier. Spend less time worrying about taxes and more time running your business. Use e-file and EFTPS to your benefit.    For e-file, go to IRS.gov/EmploymentEfile for additional information. A fee may be charged to file electronically.   For EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov or call one of the numbers provided under Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), earlier.    For electronic filing of Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, and W-2VI, go to SSA.gov/employer. You may be required to file Forms W-2 electronically. For details, see the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3.       \\xa0  \\xa0 If you’re filing your tax return or paying your federal taxes electronically, a valid employer identification number (EIN) is required at the time the return is filed or the payment is made. If a valid EIN isn\\'t provided, the return or payment won\\'t be processed. This may result in penalties. See Employer identification number (EIN), later, for information about applying for an EIN.  \\xa0 Electronic funds withdrawal (EFW). If you file Form 941-SS electronically, you can e-file and use EFW to pay the balance due in a single step using tax preparation software or through a tax professional. However, don\\'t use EFW to make federal tax deposits. For more information on paying your taxes using EFW, go to IRS.gov/EFW.    Credit or debit card payments. You can pay the balance due shown on Form 941-SS by credit or debit card. Your payment will be processed by a payment processor who will charge a processing fee. Don\\'t use a credit or debit card to make federal tax deposits. For more information on paying your taxes with a credit or debit card, go to IRS.gov/PayByCard.   Online payment agreement. You may be eligible to apply for an installment agreement online if you can’t pay the full amount of tax you owe when you file your return. For more information, see What if you can\\'t pay in full, later.   Paid preparers. If you use a paid preparer to complete Form 941-SS, the paid preparer must complete and sign the paid preparer\\'s section of the form.   Where can you get telephone help? For answers to your questions about completing Form 941-SS or tax deposit rules, call the IRS at one of the numbers listed below.    800-829-4933 (toll free; for use by U.S. Virgin Islands only) or 800-829-4059 (TDD/TTY for persons who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability) Monday–Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. local time.    \\xa0    267-941-1000 (toll call) Monday–Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern time.    \\xa0   Photographs of missing children. The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in instructions on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.       General Instructions:    \\xa0 Purpose of Form 941-SS Use Form 941-SS to report social security and Medicare taxes for workers in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Pub. 80 explains the requirements for withholding, depositing, and paying social security and Medicare taxes. It explains the forms you must give your employees, those your employees must give you, and those you must send to the IRS. See Pub. 15-A, Employer\\'s Supplemental Tax Guide, for specialized employment tax information supplementing the basic information provided in Pub. 80. Federal law requires you, as an employer, to withhold certain taxes from your employees\\' pay. Each time you pay wages, you must withhold—or take out of your employees\\' pay—certain amounts for social security tax and Medicare tax. You must also withhold Additional Medicare Tax from wages you pay to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. Under the withholding system, taxes withheld from your employees are credited to your employees in payment of their tax liabilities. Federal law also requires you to pay any liability for the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes. This share of social security and Medicare taxes isn\\'t withheld from employees.   \\xa0 Who Must File Form 941-SS? Generally, you must file a return for the first quarter in which you pay wages subject to social security and Medicare taxes, and for each quarter thereafter until you file a final return. Use Form 941-SS if your principal place of business is in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, or if you have employees who are subject to income tax withholding for these jurisdictions. Use Form 941-SS to report the following amounts.    Wages/tips subject to social security and Medicare taxes.   Both the employer and the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes.   Additional Medicare Tax withheld from employees.   Current quarter\\'s adjustments to social security and Medicare taxes for fractions of cents, sick pay, tips, and group-term life insurance.   Qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities.    \\xa0 Don\\'t use Form 941-SS if you have both employees who are subject to U.S. income tax withholding and employees who aren\\'t subject to U.S. income tax withholding. Instead, you must file only Form 941 (or Form 944) and include all of your employees\\' wages on that form. Don\\'t use Form 941-SS to report backup withholding or income tax withholding on nonpayroll payments such as pensions, annuities, and gambling winnings. Report these types of withholding on Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax. Also, don\\'t use Form 941-SS to report unemployment taxes. Report unemployment taxes (U.S. Virgin Islands employers only) on Form 940, Employer\\'s Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return. After you file your first Form 941-SS, you must file a return each quarter, even if you have no tax liability to report, unless you filed a final return or one of the exceptions listed next applies.  \\xa0 Exceptions Special rules apply to some employers.    If you received notification to file Form 944, you must file Form 944 annually; don\\'t file Form 941-SS quarterly.   Seasonal employers don\\'t have to file a Form 941-SS for quarters in which they have no tax liability because they have paid no wages. To tell the IRS that you won\\'t file a return for one or more quarters during the year, check the box on line 18 every quarter you file Form 941-SS. The IRS generally won\\'t inquire about unfiled returns if at least one taxable return is filed each year. However, you must check the box on line 18 on every quarterly return you file. Otherwise, the IRS will expect a return to be filed for each quarter.   Employers of household employees don\\'t usually file Form 941-SS. See Pub. 80, Pub. 926, and Schedule H (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for more information.   Employers of farm employees don\\'t file Form 941-SS for wages paid for agricultural labor. See Form 943 and Pub. 51 for more information.    \\xa0  \\xa0 If none of the above exceptions applies and you haven\\'t filed a final return, you must file Form 941-SS each quarter even if you didn\\'t pay wages during the quarter. Use IRS e-file, if possible.   \\xa0 Requesting To File Forms 941-SS Instead of Form 944, or Requesting To File Form 944 Instead of Forms 941-SS  Requesting to file Forms 941-SS instead of Form 944. Employers in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that would otherwise be required to file Form 944, Employer\\'s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return, may contact the IRS to request to file quarterly Forms 941-SS instead of annual Form 944. To request to file quarterly Forms 941-SS to report your social security and Medicare taxes for the 2020 calendar year, you must either call the IRS at 800-829-4933 (U.S. Virgin Islands only) or 267-941-1000 (toll call) between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020, or send a written request postmarked between January 1, 2020, and March 16, 2020. After you contact the IRS, the IRS will send you a written notice that your filing requirement has been changed to Forms 941-SS. You must receive written notice from the IRS to file Forms 941-SS instead of Form 944 before you may file these forms. If you don\\'t receive this notice, you must file Form 944 for calendar year 2020.   Requesting to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941-SS. If you’re required to file Forms 941-SS but believe your employment taxes for 2020 will be $1,000 or less, you may request to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941-SS by calling the IRS at 800-829-4933 (U.S. Virgin Islands only) or 267-941-1000 (toll call) between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020, or sending a written request postmarked between January 1, 2020, and March 16, 2020. After you contact the IRS, the IRS will send you a written notice that your filing requirement has been changed to Form 944. You must receive written notice from the IRS to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941-SS before you may file this form. If you don\\'t receive this notice, you must file Forms 941-SS for calendar year 2020.   Where to send written requests. Written requests should be sent to:  Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Ogden, UT 84201-0038 \\xa0 For more information about these procedures, see Rev. Proc. 2009-51, 2009-45 I.R.B. 625, available at IRS.gov/irb/2009-45_IRB#RP-2009-51.    \\xa0 What if You Reorganize or Close Your Business?  \\xa0    If You Sell or Transfer Your Business . . .    If you sell or transfer your business during the quarter, you and the new owner must each file a Form 941-SS for the quarter in which the transfer occurred. Report only the wages you paid. When two businesses merge, the continuing firm must file a return for the quarter in which the change took place and the other firm should file a final return. Changing from one form of business to another—such as from a sole proprietorship to a partnership or corporation—is considered a transfer. If a transfer occurs, you may need a new EIN. See Pub. 1635 and section 1 of Pub. 80 for more information. Attach a statement to your return with:    The new owner\\'s name (or the new name of the business);   Whether the business is now a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation;   The kind of change that occurred (a sale or transfer);   The date of the change; and   The name of the person keeping the payroll records and the address where those records will be kept.    \\xa0   \\xa0    If Your Business Has Closed . . .    If you go out of business or stop paying wages to your employees, you must file a final return. To tell the IRS that Form 941-SS for a particular quarter is your final return, check the box on line 17 and enter the final date you paid wages. Also attach a statement to your return showing the name of the person keeping the payroll records and the address where those records will be kept. See Terminating a business in the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for information about earlier dates for the expedited furnishing and filing of the following Wage and Tax Statements when a final Form 941-SS is filed.    W-2AS, American Samoa.   W-2CM, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.   W-2GU, Guam.   W-2VI, U.S. Virgin Islands.    \\xa0 If you participated in a statutory merger or consolidation, or qualify for predecessor-successor status due to an acquisition, you should generally file Schedule D (Form 941), Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations. See the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) to determine whether you should file Schedule D (Form 941) and when you should file it.     \\xa0 When Must You File? File your initial Form 941-SS for the quarter in which you first paid wages that are subject to social security and Medicare taxes. See the table below titled When To File Form 941-SS. Then you must file for every quarter after that—every 3 months—even if you have no taxes to report, unless you’re a seasonal employer or are filing your final return. See Seasonal employers and If Your Business Has Closed, earlier. File Form 941-SS only once for each quarter. If you filed electronically, don\\'t file a paper Form 941-SS. For more information about filing Form 941-SS electronically, see Electronic filing and payment, earlier.  When To File Form 941-SS          Your Form 941-SS is due by the last day of the month that follows the end of the quarter.   The Quarter Includes . . . Quarter Ends Form 941-SS \\t\\t\\tIs Due   1. January, February, March March 31 April 30   2. April, May, June June 30 July 31   3. July, August, September September 30 October 31   4. October, November, December December 31 January 31      \\xa0 For example, you generally must report wages you pay during the first quarter—which is January through March—by April 30. If you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the quarter, you may file by the 10th day of the second month that follows the end of the quarter. For example, you may file Form 941-SS by May 10 if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the first quarter. If we receive Form 941-SS after the due date, we will treat Form 941-SS as filed on time if the envelope containing Form 941-SS is properly addressed, contains sufficient postage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the due date, or sent by an IRS-designated private delivery service (PDS) on or before the due date. If you don\\'t follow these guidelines, we generally will consider Form 941-SS filed when it is actually received. For more information about PDSs, see Where Should You File, later. If any due date for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file your return on the next business day.   \\xa0 How Should You Complete Form 941-SS? Type or print your EIN, name, and address in the spaces provided. Also enter your name and EIN on the top of page 2. Don\\'t use your social security number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Generally, enter the business (legal) name you used when you applied for your EIN. For example, if you’re a sole proprietor, enter \"Haleigh Smith\" on the \"Name\" line and \"Haleigh\\'s Cycles\" on the \"Trade name\" line. Leave the \"Trade name\" line blank if it is the same as your \"Name.\" If you use a tax preparer to fill out Form 941-SS, make sure the preparer shows your business name exactly as it appeared when you applied for your EIN.  Employer identification number (EIN). To make sure that businesses comply with federal tax laws, the IRS monitors tax filings and payments by using a numerical system to identify taxpayers. A unique nine-digit EIN is assigned to all corporations, partnerships, and some sole proprietors. Businesses needing an EIN must apply for a number and use it throughout the life of the business on all tax returns, payments, and reports. Your business should have only one EIN. If you have more than one and aren\\'t sure which one to use, write to the IRS office where you file your returns (using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, later) or call the IRS at 800-829-4933 (toll free; for use by U.S. Virgin Islands only) or 267-941-1099 (toll call). If you don\\'t have an EIN, you may apply for one online by visiting IRS.gov/EIN. You may also apply for an EIN by faxing or mailing Form SS-4 to the IRS. If the principal business was created outside of the United States or U.S. territories, you may also apply for an EIN by calling 267-941-1099 (toll call). If you haven\\'t received your EIN by the due date of Form 941-SS, write \"Applied For\" and the date you applied in this entry space.  \\xa0 If you’re filing your tax return electronically, a valid EIN is required at the time the return is filed. If a valid EIN isn\\'t provided, the return won\\'t be accepted. This may result in penalties.  \\xa0 Always be sure the EIN on the form you file exactly matches the EIN the IRS assigned to your business. Don\\'t use your SSN or ITIN on forms that ask for an EIN. Filing a Form 941-SS with an incorrect EIN or using another business\\'s EIN may result in penalties and delays in processing your return.   If you change your business name, business address, or responsible party . . . Notify the IRS immediately if you change your business name, business address, or responsible party.     Write to the IRS office where you file your returns (using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, later) to notify the IRS of any business name change. See Pub. 1635 to see if you need to apply for a new EIN.   Complete and mail Form 8822-B to notify the IRS of a business address or responsible party change. Don\\'t mail Form 8822-B with your Form 941-SS. For a definition of \"responsible party,\" see the Instructions for Form SS-4.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Check the Box for the Quarter Under \"Report for this Quarter of 2020\" at the top of Form 941-SS, check the appropriate box of the quarter for which you\\'re filing. Make sure the quarter checked is the same as shown on any attached Schedule B (Form 941), Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule Depositors.   \\xa0 Completing and Filing Form 941-SS Make entries on Form 941-SS as follows to enable accurate processing.    Use 10-point Courier font (if possible) for all entries if you’re typing or using a computer to complete your form. Portable Document Format (PDF) forms on IRS.gov have fillable fields with acceptable font specifications.   Don\\'t enter dollar signs and decimal points. Commas are optional. Enter dollars to the left of the preprinted decimal point and cents to the right of it. Don’t round entries to whole dollars. Always show an amount for cents, even if it is zero.   Leave blank any data field (except lines 1 and 12) with a value of zero.   Enter negative amounts using a minus sign (if possible). Otherwise, use parentheses.   Enter your name and EIN on all pages and attachments.   Staple multiple sheets in the upper left corner when filing.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Reconciling Forms 941-SS and W-3SS The IRS matches amounts reported on your four quarterly Forms 941-SS with Form W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, or W-2VI amounts totaled on your yearly Form W-3SS, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements. If the amounts don\\'t agree, you may be contacted by the IRS or the Social Security Administration (SSA). The following amounts are reconciled. \\xa0    Social security wages.   Social security tips.   Medicare wages and tips.    \\xa0 Use Schedule D (Form 941) to explain certain wage, tax, and payment discrepancies between Forms 941-SS and Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, W-2VI, W-3SS, and W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, that were caused by acquisitions, statutory mergers, or consolidations. For more information, see the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941). Also see Rev. Proc. 2004-53 for more information. You can find Rev. Proc. 2004-53 on page 320 of I.R.B. 2004-34 at IRS.gov/irb/2004-34_IRB#RP-2004-53.    \\xa0 Where Should You File? You\\'re encouraged to file Form 941-SS electronically. Go to IRS.gov/EmploymentEfile for more information on electronic filing.

Go to IRS.gov/PDS for the current list of PDSs. For the IRS mailing address to use if you\\'re using a PDS, go to IRS.gov/PDSstreetAddresses. Select the address on the webpage that is given for the Ogden Submission Processing Center.  \\xa0 Your filing address may have changed from that used to file your employment tax return in prior years. Don\\'t send Form 941-SS or any payments to the SSA.   \\xa0 Depositing Your Taxes  \\xa0 You must deposit all depository taxes electronically by EFT. For more information, see Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) under Reminders, earlier.  \\xa0 Must You Deposit Your Taxes? You may have to deposit both the employer and employee social security taxes and Medicare taxes.    If your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) are less than $2,500 for the current quarter or the prior quarter, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. You don\\'t have to make a deposit. To avoid a penalty, you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely. For more information on paying with a timely filed return, see the instructions for line 14, later. If you’re not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $2,500 (and your liability for the prior quarter wasn\\'t less than $2,500), make deposits using the semiweekly or monthly rules so you won\\'t be subject to failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalties.   If your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) are $2,500 or more for the current quarter and the prior quarter. You must make deposits according to your deposit schedule. See section 8 of Pub. 80 for information about payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule and for rules about federal tax deposits.    \\xa0 You may reduce your deposits during the quarter by the amount of the COBRA premium assistance credit that will be reflected on your Form 941-X, but only if you use the claim process and not the adjustment process to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit on your Form 941-X for the quarter. The COBRA premium assistance credit is treated as a credit on the first day of the return period (that is, January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). However, because the credit is now claimed on Form 941-X filed after submission of the Form 941-SS, an employer that reduces its required deposits in anticipation of the credit will receive a system-generated notice reflecting a balance due and associated penalties and interest, if applicable. The balance due, including any related penalties and interest, resulting from the reduction in deposits in anticipation of the credit will be abated when the credit is applied. Such abatement will generally occur without any further action from the employer. Alternatively, to prevent triggering a system-generated balance due notice, the employer can make its deposits without a reduction in anticipation of the COBRA premium assistance credit and follow the ordinary procedures for filing a claim for refund or adjusted return using Form 941-X.   \\xa0 When Must You Deposit Your Taxes?  \\xa0    Determine if You’re a Monthly or Semiweekly Schedule Depositor for the Quarter    The IRS uses two different sets of deposit rules to determine when businesses must deposit their social security and Medicare taxes. These schedules tell you when a deposit is due after you have a payday. Your deposit schedule isn\\'t determined by how often you pay your employees. Your deposit schedule depends on the total tax liability you reported on Form 941-SS during the previous 4-quarter lookback period (July 1 of the second preceding calendar year through June 30 of the preceding calendar year). See section 8 of Pub. 80 for details. If you filed Form 944 in either 2018 or 2019, your lookback period is the 2018 calendar year. Before the beginning of each calendar year, determine which type of deposit schedule you must use.    If you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor.   If you reported more than $50,000 of taxes during the lookback period, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.    \\xa0  \\xa0 If you’re a monthly schedule depositor and accumulate a $100,000 tax liability on any day during the deposit period, you become a semiweekly schedule depositor on the next day and remain so for at least the rest of the calendar year and for the following calendar year. See $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule in section 8 of Pub. 80 for more information.     \\xa0 What About Penalties and Interest?  \\xa0 Avoiding Penalties and Interest You can avoid paying penalties and interest if you do all of the following.    Deposit or pay your taxes when they are due.   File your fully completed Form 941-SS on time.   Report your tax liability accurately.   Submit valid checks for tax payments.   Furnish accurate Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, or W-2VI to employees.   File Form W-3SS and Copy A of Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, or W-2VI with the SSA on time and accurately.    \\xa0 Penalties and interest are charged on taxes paid late and returns filed late at a rate set by law. See section 8 of Pub. 80 for details. Use Form 843 to request abatement of assessed penalties or interest. Don\\'t request abatement of assessed penalties or interest on Form 941-SS or Form 941-X. If you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don\\'t attach an explanation when you file your return.  \\xa0 If federal income, social security, and Medicare taxes that must be withheld (that is, trust fund taxes) aren\\'t withheld or aren\\'t deposited or paid to the United States Treasury, the trust fund recovery penalty may apply. The penalty is 100% of the unpaid trust fund tax. If these unpaid taxes can\\'t be immediately collected from the employer or business, the trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to be responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. For more information, see section 8 of Pub. 80.   \\xa0 Adjustment of Tax on Tips If, by the 10th of the month after the month you received an employee\\'s report on tips, you don\\'t have enough employee funds available to withhold the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes, you no longer have to collect it. Report the entire amount of these tips on line 5b (Taxable social security tips), line 5c (Taxable Medicare wages and tips), and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 5d (Taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding). Include as a negative adjustment on line 9 the total uncollected employee share of the social security and Medicare taxes.    \\xa0 Where Can You Obtain Forms?

If No Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation Are Subject to Social Security or Medicare Tax . . . If no wages, tips, and compensation are subject to social security or Medicare tax, check the box on line 4. If this question doesn\\'t apply to you, leave the box blank. For more information about exempt wages, see section 12 of Pub. 80. For religious exemptions, see section 4 of Pub. 15-A.  \\xa0 If you’re a government employer, wages you pay aren\\'t automatically exempt from social security and Medicare taxes. Your employees may be covered by law or by a voluntary Section 218 Agreement with the SSA. For more information, see Pub. 963, Federal-State Reference Guide.   \\xa0 5a–5e. Taxable Social Security and Medicare Wages and Tips  \\xa0 5a. Taxable social security wages. Enter the total wages, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits subject to social security taxes you paid to your employees during the quarter. For this purpose, sick pay includes payments made by an insurance company to your employees for which you received timely notice from the insurance company. See section 6 in Pub. 15-A for more information about sick pay reporting. Enter the amount before payroll deductions. Don\\'t include tips on this line. For information on types of wages subject to social security taxes, see section 4 of Pub. 80. For 2020, the rate of social security tax on taxable wages is 6.2% (0.062) each for the employer and employee or 12.4% (0.124) for both. Stop paying social security tax on and entering an employee\\'s wages on line 5a when the employee\\'s taxable wages (including tips) reach $137,700 for the year. However, continue to withhold Medicare taxes for the whole year on wages and tips even when the social security wage base of $137,700 has been reached. \\xa0           line 5a (column 1)   x 0.124 \\xa0   line 5a (column 2)     \\xa0   \\xa0 5b. Taxable social security tips. Enter all tips your employees reported to you during the quarter until the total of the tips and wages for an employee reach $137,700 for the year. Include all tips your employees reported to you even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 6.2%. You will reduce your total taxes by the amount of any uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on tips later on line 9; see Current quarter\\'s adjustments for tips and group-term life insurance, later. Don\\'t include service charges on line 5b. For details about the difference between tips and service charges, see Rev. Rul. 2012-18, 2012-26 I.R.B. 1032, available at IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18. Your employee must report cash tips to you by the 10th day of the month after the month the tips are received. Cash tips include tips paid by cash, check, debit card, and credit card. The report should include charged tips (for example, credit and debit card charges) you paid over to the employee for charge customers, tips the employee received directly from customers, and tips received from other employees under any tip-sharing arrangement. Both directly and indirectly tipped employees must report tips to you. No report is required for months when tips are less than $20. Employees may use Form 4070 (available only in Pub. 1244) or submit a written statement or electronic tip record. Don\\'t include allocated tips on this line. Instead, report them on Form 8027. Allocated tips aren\\'t reportable on Form 941-SS and aren\\'t subject to withholding of social security or Medicare taxes. \\xa0           line 5b (column 1)   x 0.124 \\xa0   line 5b (column 2)     \\xa0   \\xa0 5c. Taxable Medicare wages and tips. Enter all wages, tips, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits that are subject to Medicare tax. Unlike social security wages, there is no limit on the amount of wages subject to Medicare tax. The rate of Medicare tax is 1.45% (0.0145) each for the employer and employee or 2.9% (0.029) for both. Include all tips your employees reported during the quarter, even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 1.45% (0.0145). \\xa0           line 5c (column 1)   x 0.029 \\xa0   line 5c (column 2)     \\xa0 For more information, see sections 4, 5, and 7 of Pub. 80.   \\xa0 5d. Taxable wages & tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding. Enter all wages, tips, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits that are subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding. You’re required to begin withholding Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which you pay wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. Additional Medicare Tax is only imposed on the employee. There is no employer share of Additional Medicare Tax. All wages that are subject to Medicare tax are subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding if paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold. For more information on what wages are subject to Medicare tax, see the chart, Special Rules for Various Types of Employment and Payments, in section 12 of Pub. 80. For more information on Additional Medicare Tax, go to IRS.gov/ADMT. Once wages and tips exceed the $200,000 withholding threshold, include all tips your employees reported during the quarter, even if you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 0.9% (0.009). \\xa0           line 5d (column 1)   x 0.009 \\xa0   line 5d (column 2)     \\xa0   \\xa0 5e. Total social security and Medicare taxes. Add the column 2 amounts on lines 5a–5d. Enter the result on line 5e.    \\xa0 5f. Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand—Tax Due on Unreported Tips Enter the tax due from your Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand on line 5f. The IRS issues a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand to advise an employer of the amount of tips received by employees who failed to report or underreported tips to the employer. An employer isn\\'t liable for the employer share of the social security and Medicare taxes on unreported tips until notice and demand for the taxes is made to the employer by the IRS in a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand. The tax due may have been determined from tips reported to the IRS on employees\\' Forms 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income, or other tips that weren\\'t reported to their employer as determined by the IRS during an examination. For additional information, see Rev. Rul. 2012-18, 2012-26 I.R.B. 1032, available at IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18. Deposit the tax within the time period required under your deposit schedule to avoid any possible deposit penalty. The tax is treated as accumulated by the employer on the \"Date of Notice and Demand\" as printed on the Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand. The employer must include this amount on the appropriate line of the record of federal tax liability (Part 2 of Form 941-SS for a monthly schedule depositor or Schedule B (Form 941) for a semiweekly schedule depositor).   \\xa0 6. Total Taxes Before Adjustments Add the total social security and Medicare taxes before adjustments (line 5e) and any tax due under a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand (line 5f). Enter the result on line 6.   \\xa0 7–9. Tax Adjustments Enter tax amounts on lines 7–9 that result from current quarter adjustments. Use a minus sign (if possible) to show an adjustment that decreases the total taxes shown on line 6, instead of parentheses. Doing so enhances the accuracy of our scanning software. For example, enter \"-10.59\" instead of \"(10.59).\" However, if your software only allows for parentheses in entering negative amounts, you may use them.  Current quarter\\'s adjustments. In certain cases, you must adjust the amounts you entered as social security and Medicare taxes in column 2 of lines 5a–5d to figure your correct tax liability for this quarter\\'s Form 941-SS. See section 9 of Pub. 80.   \\xa0 7. Current quarter\\'s adjustment for fractions of cents. Enter adjustments for fractions of cents (due to rounding) relating to the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes withheld. The employee share of amounts shown in column 2 of lines 5a–5d may differ slightly from amounts actually withheld from employees\\' pay due to the rounding of social security and Medicare taxes based on statutory rates. This adjustment may be a positive or negative amount.   \\xa0 8. Current quarter\\'s adjustment for sick pay. Enter a negative adjustment for the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes that were withheld and deposited by your third-party sick pay payer with regard to sick pay paid by the third party. These wages should be included on line 5a, line 5c, and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 5d. If you’re the third-party sick pay payer, enter a negative adjustment for any employer share of these taxes required to be paid by the employer.   \\xa0 9. Current quarter\\'s adjustments for tips and group-term life insurance. Enter a negative adjustment for:    Any uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on tips, and   The uncollected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on group-term life insurance premiums paid for former employees.    \\xa0   Prior quarter\\'s adjustments. If you need to correct any adjustment reported on a previously filed Form 941-SS, complete and file Form 941-X. Form 941-X is an adjusted return or claim for refund and is filed separately from Form 941-SS. See section 9 of Pub. 80.    \\xa0 10. Total Taxes After Adjustments Combine the amounts shown on lines 6–9 and enter the result on line 10.   \\xa0 11. Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities Enter the amount of the credit from Form 8974, line 12.  \\xa0 If you enter an amount on line 11, you must attach Form 8974.   \\xa0 12. Total Taxes After Adjustments and Credits Subtract line 11 from line 10 and enter the result on line 12. \\xa0    If line 12 is less than $2,500 or line 12 on the prior quarterly return was less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. You may pay the amount with Form 941-SS or you may deposit the amount. To avoid a penalty, you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely. For more information on paying with a timely filed return, see the instructions for line 14, later.   If line 12 is $2,500 or more and line 12 on the prior quarterly return was $2,500 or more, or if you incurred a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. You must make deposits according to your deposit schedule. The amount shown on line 12 must equal the \"Total liability for quarter\" shown on line 16 or the \"Total liability for the quarter\" shown on Schedule B (Form 941).    \\xa0 For more information and rules about federal tax deposits, see Depositing Your Taxes, earlier, and section 8 of Pub. 80.  \\xa0 If you’re a semiweekly depositor, you must complete Schedule B (Form 941). If you fail to complete and submit Schedule B (Form 941), the IRS may assert deposit penalties based on available information.   \\xa0 13. Total Deposits for This Quarter Enter your deposits for this quarter, including any overpayment from a prior quarter that you applied to this return. Also include in the amount shown any overpayment that you applied from filing Form 941-X or Form 944-X, Adjusted Employer\\'s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, in the current quarter.   \\xa0 14. Balance Due If line 12 is more than line 13, enter the difference on line 14. Otherwise, see Overpayment, later. Never make an entry on both lines 14 and 15. You don\\'t have to pay if line 14 is under $1. Generally, you should have a balance due only if your total taxes after adjustments and credits (line 12) for the current quarter or prior quarter are less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter. However, see section 8 of Pub. 80 for information about payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule. If you were required to make federal tax deposits, pay the amount shown on line 14 by EFT. If you weren\\'t required to make federal tax deposits (see Must You Deposit Your Taxes, earlier) or you’re a monthly schedule depositor making a payment under the accuracy of deposits rule, you may pay the amount shown on line 14 by EFT, credit card, debit card, check, money order, or EFW. For more information on electronic payment options, go to IRS.gov/Payments. If you pay by EFT, credit card, or debit card, file your return using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, earlier, and don\\'t file Form 941-V(SS), Payment Voucher. If you pay by check or money order, make it payable to \"United States Treasury.\" Enter your EIN, \"Form 941-SS,\" and the tax period (\"1st Quarter 2020,\" \"2nd Quarter 2020,\" \"3rd Quarter 2020,\" or \"4th Quarter 2020\") on your check or money order. Complete Form 941-V(SS) and enclose it with Form 941-SS. If line 12 is $2,500 or more on both your prior and current quarter Form 941-SS, and you’ve deposited all taxes when due, the balance due on line 14 should be zero, unless you’ve reduced your deposits in anticipation of filing a Form 941-X to claim COBRA premium assistance credits. See Depositing Your Taxes, earlier.  \\xa0 If you’re required to make deposits and instead pay the taxes with Form 941-SS, you may be subject to a penalty. See Must You Deposit Your Taxes, earlier.   \\xa0 What if you can\\'t pay in full? If you can\\'t pay the full amount of tax you owe, you can apply for an installment agreement online. You can apply for an installment agreement online if:    You can\\'t pay the full amount shown on line 14,   The total amount you owe is $25,000 or less, and   You can pay the liability in full in 24 months.    \\xa0 To apply using the Online Payment Agreement Application, visit the IRS website at IRS.gov/OPA. Under an installment agreement, you can pay what you owe in monthly installments. There are certain conditions you must meet to enter into and maintain an installment agreement, such as paying the liability within 24 months, and making all required deposits and timely filing tax returns during the length of the agreement. If your installment agreement is accepted, you will be charged a fee and you will be subject to penalties and interest on the amount of tax not paid by the due date of the return.   \\xa0 15. Overpayment If line 13 is more than line 12, enter the difference on line 15. Never make an entry on both lines 14 and 15. If you deposited more than the correct amount for the quarter, you can choose to have the IRS either refund the overpayment or apply it to your next return. Check only one box on line 15. If you don\\'t check either box or if you check both boxes, generally we will apply the overpayment to your next return. Regardless of any boxes you check or don’t check on line 15, we may apply your overpayment to any past due tax account that is shown in our records under your EIN. If line 15 is under $1, we will send a refund or apply it to your next return only if you ask us in writing to do so.   \\xa0 Complete Both Pages You must complete both pages of Form 941-SS and sign on page 2. Failure to do so may delay processing of your return.    \\xa0 Part 2: Tell Us About Your Deposit Schedule and Tax Liability for This Quarter  \\xa0 16. Tax Liability for the Quarter Check one of the boxes on line 16. Follow the instructions for each box to determine if you need to enter your monthly tax liability on Form 941-SS or your daily tax liability on Schedule B (Form 941).  De minimis exception. If line 12 is less than $2,500 or line 12 on the prior quarterly return was less than $2,500, and you didn\\'t incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter, check the first box on line 16 and go to Part 3.  \\xa0 If you meet the de minimis exception based on the prior quarter and line 12 for the current quarter is $100,000 or more, you must provide a record of your federal tax liability. If you’re a monthly schedule depositor, complete the deposit schedule on line 16. If you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, attach Schedule B (Form 941).   Monthly schedule depositor. If you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule discussed in section 8 of Pub. 80 applies. Check the second box on line 16 and enter your tax liability for each month in the quarter. Add the amounts for each month. Enter the result in the \"Total liability for quarter\" box. Note that your total tax liability for the quarter must equal your total taxes shown on line 12. If it doesn\\'t, your tax deposits and payments may not be counted as timely. Don\\'t change your tax liability on line 16 by adjustments reported on any Forms 941-X. You’re a monthly schedule depositor for the calendar year if the amount of your Form 941-SS taxes reported for the lookback period is $50,000 or less. The lookback period is the 4 consecutive quarters ending on June 30 of the prior year. For 2020, the lookback period begins July 1, 2018, and ends June 30, 2019. For details on the deposit rules, see section 8 of Pub. 80. If you filed Form 944 in 2018 or 2019, your lookback period is the 2018 calendar year.  \\xa0 The amounts entered on line 16 are a summary of your monthly tax liability, not a summary of deposits you made. If you don\\'t properly enter your liabilities when required or if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor and report your liabilities on line 16 instead of on Schedule B (Form 941), you may be assessed an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. See Deposit Penalties in section 8 of Pub. 80 for more information.   \\xa0 Reporting adjustments from lines 7–9 on line 16. If your net adjustment during a month is negative and it exceeds your total tax liability for the month, don\\'t enter a negative amount for the month. Instead, enter \"-0-\" for the month and carry over the unused portion of the adjustment to the next month.   Semiweekly schedule depositor. If you reported more than $50,000 of taxes for the lookback period, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor. Check the third box on line 16. You must complete Schedule B (Form 941) and submit it with your Form 941-SS. Don\\'t file Schedule B (Form 941) with your Form 941-SS if you’re a monthly schedule depositor. Don\\'t change your tax liability on Schedule B (Form 941) by adjustments reported on any Forms 941-X.   Adjusting tax liability for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities reported on line 11. Monthly schedule depositors and semiweekly schedule depositors must account for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities (line 11) when reporting their tax liabilities on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941). The total tax liability for the quarter must equal the amount reported on line 12. Failure to account for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941) may cause line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941) to be more than the total tax liability reported on line 12. The qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities applies to the employer share of social security tax on wages paid in the quarter that begins after the income tax return electing the credit has been filed. In completing line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941), you take into account the payroll tax credit against the liability for the employer share of social security tax starting with the first payroll payment of the quarter that includes payments of wages subject to social security tax to your employees. The credit may be taken to the extent of the employer share of social security tax on wages associated with the first payroll payment, and then to the extent of the employer share of social security tax associated with succeeding payroll payments in the quarter until the credit is used. Don\\'t reduce your monthly tax liability reported on line 16 or your daily tax liability reported on Schedule B (Form 941) below zero. Consistent with the entries on line 16 or Schedule B (Form 941), the payroll tax credit should be taken into account in making deposits of employment tax. If any payroll tax credit is remaining at the end of the quarter that has not been used completely because it exceeds the employer share of social security tax for the quarter, the excess credit may be carried forward to the succeeding quarter and allowed as a payroll tax credit for the succeeding quarter. The payroll tax credit may not be taken as a credit against income tax withholding, Medicare tax, or the employee share of social security tax. Also, the remaining payroll tax credit may not be carried back and taken as a credit against wages paid from preceding quarters.    Example. Rose Co. is an employer with a calendar tax year that filed its timely income tax return on April 15, 2020. Rose Co. elected to take the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities on Form 6765. The third quarter of 2020 is the first quarter that begins after Rose Co. filed the income tax return making the payroll tax credit election. Therefore, the payroll tax credit applies against Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid to employees in the third quarter of 2020. Rose Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor. Rose Co. completes Schedule B (Form 941) by reducing the amount of liability entered for the first payroll payment in the third quarter of 2020 that includes wages subject to social security tax by the lesser of (1) its share of social security tax on the wages, or (2) the available payroll tax credit. If the payroll tax credit elected is more than Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on the first payroll payment of the quarter, the excess payroll tax credit would be carried forward to succeeding payroll payments in the third quarter until it is used. If the amount of the payroll tax credit exceeds Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid to its employees in the third quarter, the excess credit would be treated as a payroll tax credit against its share of social security tax on wages paid in the fourth quarter. If the amount of the payroll tax credit remaining exceeded Rose Co.\\'s share of social security tax on wages paid in the fourth quarter, it could be carried forward and treated as a payroll tax credit for the first quarter of 2021.     \\xa0 Part 3: Tell Us About Your Business In Part 3, answer only those questions that apply to your business. If the questions don\\'t apply, leave them blank and go to Part 4.  \\xa0 17. If Your Business Has Closed . . . If you go out of business or stop paying wages, you must file a final return. To tell the IRS that a particular Form 941-SS is your final return, check the box on line 17 and enter the final date you paid wages in the space provided. For additional filing requirements, see If Your Business Has Closed, earlier.   \\xa0 18. If You’re a Seasonal Employer . . . If you hire employees seasonally—such as for summer or winter only—check the box on line 18. Checking the box tells the IRS not to expect four Forms 941-SS from you throughout the year because you haven\\'t paid wages regularly. Generally, we won\\'t ask about unfiled returns if at least one taxable return is filed each year. However, you must check the box on line 18 on every Form 941-SS you file. Otherwise, the IRS will expect a return to be filed for each quarter. Also, when you complete Form 941-SS, be sure to check the box on the top of the form that corresponds to the quarter reported.    \\xa0 Part 4: May We Speak With Your Third-Party Designee? If you want to allow an employee, a paid tax preparer, or another person to discuss your Form 941-SS with the IRS, check the \"Yes\" box in Part 4. Enter the name, phone number, and the five-digit personal identification number (PIN) of the specific person to speak with—not the name of the firm that prepared your tax return. The designee may choose any five numbers as his or her PIN. By checking \"Yes,\" you authorize the IRS to talk to the person you named (your designee) about any questions we may have while we process your return. You also authorize your designee to do all of the following.    Give us any information that is missing from your return.   Call us for information about processing your return.   Respond to certain IRS notices that you’ve shared with your designee about math errors and return preparation. The IRS won\\'t send notices to your designee.    \\xa0 You’re not authorizing your designee to bind you to anything (including additional tax liability) or to otherwise represent you before the IRS. If you want to expand your designee\\'s authorization, see Pub. 947. The authorization will automatically expire 1 year from the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing your Form 941-SS. If you or your designee wants to terminate the authorization, write to the IRS office for your location using the Without a payment address under Where Should You File, earlier.   \\xa0 Part 5: Sign Here (Approved Roles) Complete all information and sign Form 941-SS. The following persons are authorized to sign the return for each type of business entity.    Sole proprietorship—The individual who owns the business.   Corporation (including a limited liability company (LLC) treated as a corporation)—The president, vice president, or other principal officer duly authorized to sign.   Partnership  (including an LLC treated as a partnership)  or unincorporated organization—A responsible and duly authorized partner, member, or officer having knowledge of its affairs.   Single-member LLC treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes—The owner of the LLC or a principal officer duly authorized to sign.

Proc. 2005-39, 2005-28 I.R.B. 82, available at IRS.gov/irb/2005-28_IRB#RP-2005-39.   \\xa0 Paid Preparer Use Only A paid preparer must sign Form 941-SS and provide the information in the Paid Preparer Use Only section of Part 5 if the preparer was paid to prepare Form 941-SS and isn\\'t an employee of the filing entity. Paid preparers must sign paper returns with a manual signature. The preparer must give you a copy of the return in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS. If you’re a paid preparer, enter your preparer tax identification number (PTIN) in the space provided. Include your complete address. If you work for a firm, enter the firm\\'s name and the EIN of the firm. You can apply for a PTIN online or by filing Form W-12. For more information about applying for a PTIN online, go to IRS.gov/PTIN. You can\\'t use your PTIN in place of the EIN of the tax preparation firm. Generally, don\\'t complete this section if you’re filing the return as a reporting agent and have a valid Form 8655 on file with the IRS. However, a reporting agent must complete this section if the reporting agent offered legal advice, for example, advising the client on determining whether its workers are employees or independent contractors for federal tax purposes.    \\xa0 How To Get Forms, Instructions, and Publications From the IRS  \\xa0 You can view, download, or print most of the forms, instructions, and publications you may need at IRS.gov/Forms.

       " '   Instructions for Form 941-X (04/2017) Adjusted Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 04/2017     General Instructions: Understanding Form 941-X    What Is the Purpose of Form 941-X?    For tax periods beginning after December 31, 2013, Forms 941 and 941-SS will no longer be used to claim the credit for COBRA premium assistance payments. Instead, use Form 941-X. For more information, see the instructions for lines 20a and 20b, later. Use Form 941-X to correct errors on a Form 941 that you previously filed. Use Form 941-X to correct:   Wages, tips, and other compensation; Income tax withheld from wages, tips, and other compensation; Taxable social security wages; Taxable social security tips; Taxable Medicare wages and tips; Taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding;  Qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities; and Credits for COBRA premium assistance payments.    Use Form 843, Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement, to request a refund or abatement of assessed interest or penalties. Don’t request a refund or abatement of assessed interest or penalties on Form 941 or Form 941-X.    References to Form 941 on Form 941-X and in these instructions also apply to Form 941-SS, Employer\\'s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return—American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, unless otherwise noted. We use the terms \"correct\" and \"corrections\" on Form 941-X and in these instructions to include interest-free adjustments under sections 6205 and 6413 and claims for refund and abatement under sections 6402, 6414, and 6404. See Rev. Rul. 2009-39 for examples of how the interest-free adjustment and claim for refund rules apply in 10 different situations. You can find Rev. Rul. 2009-39, 2009-52, I.R.B. 951 at IRS.gov/irb/2009-52_IRB/ar14.html. When you discover an error on a previously filed Form 941, you must:  Correct that error using Form 941-X, File a separate Form 941-X for each Form 941 that you’re correcting, and File Form 941-X separately. Don’t file Form 941-X with Form 941.    If you didn’t file a Form 941 for one or more quarters, don’t use Form 941-X. Instead, file Form 941 for each of those quarters. See also When Should You File Form 941-X? below. However, if you didn’t file Forms 941 because you improperly treated workers as independent contractors or nonemployees and are now reclassifying them as employees, see the instructions for line 23, later. Report the correction of underreported and overreported amounts for the same tax period on a single Form 941-X, unless you’re requesting a refund or abatement. If you’re requesting a refund or abatement and are correcting both underreported and overreported amounts, file one Form 941-X correcting the underreported amounts only and a second Form 941-X correcting the overreported amounts. You’ll use the adjustment process if you underreported employment taxes and are making a payment, or if you overreported employment taxes and will be applying the credit to Form 941 for the period during which you file Form 941-X. However, see the Caution under Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X, later, if you’re correcting overreported amounts during the last 90 days of a period of limitations. You’ll use the claim process if you overreported employment taxes and are requesting a refund or abatement of the overreported amount. Follow the chart on the back of Form 941-X for help in choosing whether to use the adjustment process or the claim process. Be sure to give us a detailed explanation on line 24 for each correction that you show on Form 941-X. Continue to report current quarter fractions of cents, third-party sick pay, tips, and group-term life insurance on Form 941, lines 7–9. You have additional requirements to complete when filing Form 941-X, such as certifying that you filed (or will file) all applicable Forms W-2 and Forms W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statements, with the Social Security Administration (SSA). For corrections of overreported federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax, you must make any certifications that apply to your situation.    Don’t use Form 941-X to correct Form CT-1, 943, 944, or 945. Instead, use the \"X\" form that corresponds to those forms (Form CT-1 X, 943-X, 944-X, or 945-X).     Where Can You Get Help?

For overreported amounts, you may choose to either make an interest-free adjustment or file a claim for refund or abatement. If you’re correcting overreported amounts, see Overreported tax—adjustment process or Overreported tax—claim process, later. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file Form 941-X on the next business day. If we receive Form 941-X after the due date, we will treat Form 941-X as filed on time if the envelope containing Form 941-X is properly addressed, contains sufficient postage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the due date, or sent by an IRS-designated private delivery service on or before the due date. If you don’t follow these guidelines, we will consider Form 941-X filed when it is actually received. See Pub. 15 or Pub. 80 for more information on legal holidays and IRS-designated private delivery services.    Underreported tax.  If you’re correcting underreported tax, you must file Form 941-X by the due date of the return for the return period in which you discovered the error and pay the amount you owe by the time you file. Doing so will generally ensure that your correction is interest free and not subject to failure-to-pay or failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalties. See What About Penalties and Interest, later. For details on how to make a payment, see the instructions for line 21, later. If Form 941-X is filed late (after the due date of the return for the return period in which you discovered the error), you must attach an amended Schedule B (Form 941) to Form 941-X. Otherwise, the IRS may assess an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. The total tax reported on the \"Total liability for the quarter\" line of Schedule B (Form 941) must match the corrected tax (Form 941, line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017), combined with any correction entered on Form 941-X, line 19) for the quarter, less any previous abatements and interest-free tax assessments.          If you discover an error in   Form 941-X is due                  1. January, February, March       April 30     2. April, May, June       July 31     3. July, August, September       October 31     4. October, November, December       January 31                 The dates shown in the table above apply only to corrections of underreported amounts. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file Form 941-X on the next business day.      Example—You owe tax. On April 10, 2017, you discovered that you underreported $10,000 of social security and Medicare wages on your 2016 first quarter Form 941. File Form 941-X and pay the amount you owe by July 31, 2017, because you discovered the error in the second quarter of 2017, and July 31, 2017, is the due date for that quarter. If you file Form 941-X before July 31, 2017, pay the amount you owe by the time you file.       Overreported tax—adjustment process.  If you overreported tax on Form 941 and choose to apply the credit to Form 941 or Form 944, file an adjusted return on Form 941-X soon after you discover the error but more than 90 days before the period of limitations on the credit or refund for Form 941 expires. See Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X? below.      If you reduced your deposits during the quarter by the amount of the COBRA premium assistance credit that will be reflected on your Form 941-X, don’t use the adjustment process to claim the COBRA premium assistance credit. Use the claim process. See the instructions for lines 20a and 20b, later.  Overreported tax—claim process.  If you overreported tax on Form 941, you may choose to file a claim for refund or abatement on Form 941-X any time before the period of limitations on credit or refund expires on Form 941. If you also need to correct any underreported amounts, you must file another Form 941-X reporting only corrections to the underreported amounts. See Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X? next.      You may not file a refund claim to correct federal income tax or Additional Medicare Tax actually withheld from employees.     Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X? Generally, you may correct overreported taxes on a previously filed Form 941 if you file Form 941-X within 3 years of the date Form 941 was filed or 2 years from the date you paid the tax reported on Form 941, whichever is later. You may correct underreported taxes on a previously filed Form 941 if you file Form 941-X within 3 years of the date the Form 941 was filed. We call each of these time frames a \"period of limitations.\" For purposes of the period of limitations, Forms 941 for a calendar year are considered filed on April 15 of the succeeding year if filed before that date.  Example. You filed your 2013 fourth quarter Form 941 on January 27, 2014, and payments were timely made. The IRS treats the return as if it were filed on April 15, 2014. On January 20, 2017, you discovered that you overreported social security and Medicare wages on that form by $350. To correct the error you must file Form 941-X by April 18, 2017, which is the end of the period of limitations for Form 941, and use the claim process.       If you file Form 941-X to correct overreported amounts in the last 90 days of a period of limitations, you must use the claim process. You can’t use the adjustment process. If you’re also correcting underreported amounts, you must file another Form 941-X to correct the underreported amounts using the adjustment process and pay any tax due.     Where Should You File Form 941-X? Send your completed Form 941-X to the address shown next.       IF you’re in THEN use this address    Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin  Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service   Cincinnati, OH 45999-0005   Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming  Department of the Treasury   Internal Revenue Service   Ogden, UT 84201-0005   No legal residence or principal place of business in any state  Internal Revenue Service   P.O.

Use a Separate Form 941-X for Each Quarter You’re Correcting Use a separate Form 941-X for each Form 941 that you’re correcting. For example, if you found errors on your Forms 941 for the third and fourth quarters of 2016, file one Form 941-X to correct the 2016 third quarter Form 941. File a second Form 941-X to correct the 2016 fourth quarter Form 941.     EIN, Name, and Address Enter your EIN, name, and address in the spaces provided. Also enter your name and EIN on the top of pages 2 and 3, and on any attachments. If your address has changed since you filed your Form 941, enter the corrected information and the IRS will update your address of record. Be sure to write your name, EIN,\" Form 941-X,\" the calendar quarter you’re correcting (for example, \"Quarter 2\"), and the calendar year of the quarter you’re correcting on the top of any attachments.     Return You’re Correcting In the box at the top of page 1, check the type of return (Form 941 or Form 941-SS) you’re correcting. Check the appropriate box for the one quarter you’re correcting. Enter the calendar year of the Form 941 you’re correcting. Enter the quarter and calendar year on pages 2 and 3. Be sure to write your name, EIN, \"Form 941-X,\" the quarter you’re correcting (for example, \"Quarter 2\"), and the calendar year of the quarter you’re correcting on the top of any attachments.     Enter the Date You Discovered Errors You must enter the date you discovered errors. You discover an error when you have enough information to be able to correct it. If you’re reporting several errors that you discovered at different times, enter the earliest date you discovered them here. Report any subsequent dates and related errors on line 24.     Must You Make an Entry on Each Line? You must provide all of the information requested at the top of page 1. You must check one box (but not both) in Part 1. In Part 2, you must check the box on line 3 and any applicable boxes on lines 4 and 5. In Part 3, if any line doesn’t apply, leave it blank. Complete Parts 4 and 5 as instructed.     How Should You Report Negative Amounts? Form 941-X uses negative numbers to show reductions in tax (credits) and positive numbers to show additional tax (amounts you owe).  When reporting a negative amount in columns 3 and 4, use a minus sign instead of parentheses. For example, enter \"-10.59\" instead of \"(10.59).\" However, if you’re completing the return on your computer and your software only allows you to use parentheses to report negative amounts, you may use them.     How Should You Make Entries on Form 941-X? You can help the IRS process Form 941-X timely and accurately if you follow these guidelines.   Type or print your entries. Use Courier font (if possible) for all typed or computer-generated entries. Omit dollar signs. You may use commas and decimal points, if desired. Enter dollar amounts to the left of any preprinted decimal point and cents to the right of it. Always show an amount for cents. Don’t round entries to whole dollars. Complete all three pages and sign Form 941-X on page 3. Staple multiple sheets in the upper-left corner.        What About Penalties and Interest? Generally, your correction of an underreported amount won’t be subject to a failure-to-pay penalty, FTD penalty, or interest if you:  File on time (by the due date of the quarter in which you discover the error),  Pay the amount shown on line 21 by the time you file Form 941-X, Enter the date you discovered the error, and Explain in detail the grounds and facts relied on to support the correction.    No correction will be eligible for interest-free treatment if any of the following apply.  The amounts underreported relate to an issue that was raised in an examination of a prior period. You knowingly underreported your employment tax liability. You received a notice and demand for payment. You received a notice of determination under section 7436.    If you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet the reasonable-cause criteria. Don’t attach an explanation when you file your return.      Overview of the Process To correct a previously filed Form 941, use Form 941-X to file either an adjusted employment tax return or a claim for refund or abatement. The adjustment process and the claim process are outlined below.    If you underreported the tax. If you underreported the tax on a previously filed Form 941, check the box on line 1 and pay any additional amount you owe by the time you file Form 941-X. For details on how to make a payment, see the instructions for line 21, later.   Example—You underreported employment taxes. On June 19, 2017, you discover an error that results in additional tax on your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941. File Form 941-X by July 31, 2017, and pay the amount you owe by the time you file. See When Should You File Form 941-X, earlier. Don’t attach Form 941-X to your 2017 second quarter Form 941.     If you overreported the tax. If you overreported the tax on a previously filed Form 941, you may choose one of the following options.   Use the adjustment process. Check the box on line 1 to apply any credit (negative amount) from line 21 to Form 941 for the quarter during which you file Form 941-X.  Use the claim process. Check the box on line 2 to file a claim on Form 941-X requesting a refund or abatement of the amount shown on line 21.       To ensure that the IRS has enough time to process a credit for an overreporting adjustment in the quarter during which you file Form 941-X, you’re encouraged to file Form 941-X correcting the overreported amount in the first two months of a quarter. For example, if you discover an overreported amount in March, June, September, or December, you may want to file Form 941-X in the first two months of the next quarter. However, there must be 90 days remaining on the period of limitations when you file Form 941-X. See the Caution under Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X, earlier. This should ensure that the IRS will have enough time to process Form 941-X so the credit will be posted before you file Form 941, thus avoiding an erroneous balance due notice from the IRS. See the example below.       Example—You want your overreported tax applied as a credit to Form 941. On June 19, 2017, you discover you overreported your tax on your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941 and want to choose the adjustment process. To allow the IRS enough time to process the credit, you file Form 941-X on July 3, 2017, and take the credit on your third quarter 2017 Form 941.       If you currently file Form 944 and you’re making a correction to a previously filed Form 941 that will be claimed as a credit on Form 944, file Form 941-X before December in any year before the expiration of the period of limitations for the previously filed Form 941. In the year that the period of limitations for the previously filed Form 941 expires, file Form 941-X at least 90 days before the expiration date.     Specific Instructions:    Part 1: Select ONLY One Process Because Form 941-X may be used to file either an adjusted employment tax return or a claim for refund or abatement, you must check one box on either line 1 or line 2. Don’t check both boxes.    1. Adjusted Employment Tax Return Check the box on line 1 if you’re correcting underreported amounts or overreported amounts and you would like to use the adjustment process to correct the errors. If you’re correcting both underreported amounts and overreported amounts on this form, you must check this box. If you check this box, any negative amount shown on line 21 will be applied as a credit (tax deposit) to your Form 941 or Form 944 for the period in which you’re filing this form. See Example—You want your overreported tax applied as a credit to Form 941 above.  If you owe tax.   Pay the amount shown on line 21 by the time you file Form 941-X. Generally, you won’t be charged interest if you file on time, pay on time, enter the date you discovered the error, and explain the correction on line 24.    If you have a credit.  You overreported employment taxes (you have a negative amount on line 21) and want the IRS to apply the credit to Form 941 or Form 944 for the period during which you filed Form 941-X. The IRS will apply your credit on the first day of the Form 941 or Form 944 period during which you filed Form 941-X. However, the credit you show on Form 941-X, line 21, may not be fully available on your Form 941 or Form 944 if the IRS corrects it during processing or you owe other taxes, penalties, or interest. The IRS will notify you if your claimed credit changes or if the amount available as a credit on Form 941 or Form 944 was reduced because of unpaid taxes, penalties, or interest.     Don’t check the box on line 1 if you’re either: (a) correcting overreported amounts and the period of limitations on credit or refund for Form 941 will expire within 90 days of the date you file Form 941-X, or (b) claiming a credit for COBRA premium assistance payments and you reduced your deposits in anticipation of the credit. Instead, in either case, check the box on line 2 to file a Form 941-X under the claim process. See Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X, earlier. Also see the instructions for lines 20a and 20b, later.       2. Claim  Check the box on line 2 to use the claim process if you’re correcting overreported amounts only and you’re claiming a refund or abatement for the negative amount (credit) shown on line 21. Don’t check this box if you’re correcting any underreported amounts on this form. You must check the box on line 2 if you have a credit and the period of limitations on credit or refund for Form 941 will expire within 90 days of the date you file Form 941-X. See Is There a Deadline for Filing Form 941-X, earlier. The IRS usually processes claims shortly after they are filed. The IRS will notify you if your claim is denied, accepted as filed, or selected to be examined. See Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, for more information. Unless the IRS corrects Form 941-X during processing or you owe other taxes, penalties, or interest, the IRS will refund the amount shown on line 21, plus any interest that applies.      You may not file a refund claim to correct federal income tax or Additional Medicare Tax actually withheld from employees.    Part 2: Complete the Certifications You must complete all certifications that apply by checking the appropriate boxes. If all of your corrections relate to underreported amounts, complete line 3 only; skip lines 4 and 5 and go to Part 3. If your corrections relate to overreported amounts, you have a duty to ensure that your employees\\' rights to recover overpaid employee social security and Medicare taxes that you withheld are protected. The certifications on lines 4 and 5 address the requirement to:  Repay or reimburse your employees for the overcollection of employee social security and Medicare taxes, or Obtain consents from your employees to file a claim on their behalf. See Rev. Proc. 2017-28 for guidance on the requirements for both a request for employee consent and for the employee consent.       3. Filing Forms W-2 or Forms W-2c Check the box on line 3 to certify that you filed or will file Forms W-2 or Forms W-2c with the SSA, as required, showing your employees\\' correct wage and tax amounts. See the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for detailed information about filing requirements. References to Form W-2 on Form 941-X and in these instructions also apply to Forms W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, and W-2VI unless otherwise noted. You must check the box on line 3 to certify that you filed Forms W-2 or Forms W-2c even if your corrections on Form 941-X don’t change amounts shown on those forms. For example, if your only correction to Form 941 involves misstated tax adjustments (see the instructions for line 13, later), check the box on line 3 to certify that you already filed all required Forms W-2 and W-2c with the SSA.     4. Certifying Overreporting Adjustments If you overreported federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax and checked the box on line 1, check the appropriate box on line 4. You may need to check more than one box. If you obtained written statements from some employees but you couldn’t locate employees or secure the statements of the remaining employees, check all applicable boxes. Provide a summary on line 24 of the amount of the corrections both for the employees who provided written statements and for those who didn’t.  4a.  Check the box on line 4a if your overreported amount includes each affected employee share of overcollected taxes. You’re certifying that you repaid or reimbursed the employee share of current and prior year taxes and you received written statements from the employees stating that they didn’t and won’t receive a refund or credit for the prior year taxes. You’re certifying that you adjusted federal income tax or Additional Medicare Tax withheld from employees for the current calendar year only. Don’t send these statements to the IRS. Keep them for your records. Generally, all employment tax records must be kept for at least 4 years. Copies must be submitted to the IRS if requested.    4b.  Check the box on line 4b to certify that your overreported amount is only for the employer share of taxes on those employees who you were unable to find or those who didn’t give you a statement described on line 4a.    4c.  Check the box on line 4c to certify that your overreported amount is only for federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax that you didn’t withhold from your employees.       5. Certifying Claims If you’re filing a claim for refund or abatement of overreported federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax and checked the box on line 2, check the appropriate box on line 5. You may need to check more than one box. If you obtained written statements or consents from some employees but you couldn’t locate employees or secure the statements or consents of the remaining employees, check all applicable boxes. Provide a summary on line 24 of the amount of the corrections for both the employees who provided statements or consents and for those who didn’t.    You can’t file a refund claim to correct federal income tax or Additional Medicare Tax actually withheld from employees in a prior year. If you request their consent to file a claim for social security tax or Medicare tax, you must tell your employees that you can’t claim a refund of any Additional Medicare Tax on their behalf. See Rev. Proc. 2017-28 for sample language to use in your request.  5a.  Check the box on line 5a if your overreported tax includes each affected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes. You’re certifying that you repaid or reimbursed to the employees their share of social security and Medicare taxes. For refunds of employee social security and Medicare taxes overcollected in prior years, you’re certifying that you received written statements from those employees stating that they didn’t and won’t receive a refund or credit for the prior year taxes. Don’t send these statements to the IRS. Keep them for your records. Generally, all employment tax records must be kept for at least 4 years. Copies must be submitted to the IRS if requested.    5b.  Check the box on line 5b if your overreported tax includes each affected employee share of social security and Medicare taxes and you haven’t yet repaid or reimbursed the employee share of taxes. You’re certifying that you received consent from each affected employee to file a claim on the employee share of those taxes and you received written statements from those employees stating that they didn’t and won’t receive a refund or credit for the prior year taxes.  An employee consent must:  Contain the name, address, and social security number (or truncated taxpayer identification number, when appropriate) of the employee; Contain the name, address, and EIN of the employer; Contain the tax period(s), type of tax, and the amount of tax for which the consent is provided; Affirmatively state that the employee authorizes the employer to claim a refund for the overpayment of the employee share of tax; For amounts collected in a prior year, include the employee’s written statement certifying that the employee hasn’t made any previous claims (or the claims were rejected) and won’t make any future claims for refund or credit of the amount of the overcollection; Identify the basis of the claim; and Be dated and contain the employee’s signature under penalties of perjury. The penalties of perjury statement should be located immediately above the required signature.    Don’t send these statements and consents to the IRS. Keep them for your records. Generally, all employment tax records must be kept for at least 4 years. Copies must be submitted to the IRS if requested.   In certain situations, you may not have repaid or reimbursed your employees or obtained their consents prior to filing a claim, such as in cases where the period of limitations on credit or refund is about to expire. In those situations, file Form 941-X, but don’t check a box on line 5. Tell us on line 24 that you haven’t repaid or reimbursed employees or obtained consents at the time you file the claim. However, you must repay or reimburse your employees and certify that you’ve done so before the IRS can allow the claim.  5c.  Check the box on line 5c to certify that your overreported tax is only for the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes. This applies when affected employees didn’t give you consent to file a claim for refund for the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes, they couldn’t be found, or they didn’t give you a statement described on line 5b.    5d.  Check the box on line 5d to certify that your overreported amount is only for federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax that you didn’t withhold from your employees.        Part 3: Enter the Corrections for This Quarter    What Amounts Should You Report in Part 3? On lines 6–11, columns 1 and 2, show amounts for all of your employees, not just for those employees whose amounts you’re correcting. If a correction that you report in column 4 includes both underreported and overreported amounts (see the instructions for line 22, later), give us details for each error on line 24. Because special circumstances apply for lines 12–18, 20a, and 20b, read the instructions for each line carefully before entering amounts in the columns.     If you previously adjusted or amended Form 941 by using Form 941-X or because of an IRS examination change, show amounts in column 2 that include those previously reported corrections.      6. Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation If you’re correcting the wages, tips, and other compensation you reported on Form 941, line 2, enter the total corrected amount for all employees in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2. This line doesn’t apply to Form 941-SS. If you or the IRS previously corrected the amount reported on Form 941, line 2, enter in column 2 the amount after any previous corrections.           line 6 (column 1)       - line 6 (column 2)        line 6 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.       Example —Wages, tips, and other compensation increased. You reported $9,000 as total wages, tips, and other compensation on line 2 of your 2017 first quarter Form 941. In May of 2017, you discovered that you had overlooked $1,000 in tips for one of your part-time employees. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 10,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 2) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 1,000.00          Example —Wages, tips, and other compensation decreased. You reported $9,000 as wages, tips, and other compensation on line 2 of your 2017 first quarter Form 941. In May of 2017, you discovered that you included $2,000 in wages for one of your employees twice. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 7,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 2) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) -2,000.00          Example—Auto allowance; wages, tips, and other compensation increased. You paid one of your employees a $500 monthly auto allowance from October through December 2016, and didn’t treat the payments as taxable wages. In February 2017, you realized that the payments were wages because they weren’t reimbursements of deductible business expenses that were substantiated and paid under an accountable plan. You correct the error by treating the auto allowance as wages subject to income, social security, and Medicare taxes. Report the additional $1,500 of wages on lines 6, 8, and 10.     The amount on line 6, column 1, should be used on your Forms W-2 or Forms W-2c. This amount should also be used for any business expense deduction on your income tax return (or amended return) for wages paid.     7. Federal Income Tax Withheld from Wages, Tips, and Other Compensation If you’re correcting the federal income tax withheld from wages, tips, and other compensation you reported on Form 941, line 3, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2. This line doesn’t apply to Form 941-SS.           line 7 (column 1)       - line 7 (column 2)        line 7 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.    Copy the amount in column 3 to column 4. Include any minus sign shown in column 3.    Generally, you may correct federal income tax withholding errors only if you discovered the errors in the same calendar year you paid the wages. In addition, for an overcollection, you may correct federal income tax withholding only if you also repaid or reimbursed the employees in the same year. For prior years, you may only correct administrative errors to federal income tax withholding (that is, errors in which the amount reported on Form 941, line 3, doesn’t agree with the amount you withheld from an employee’s wages) and errors for which section 3509 rates apply. Only transposition or math errors involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount withheld are \"administrative errors\". See section 13 of Pub. 15 for more information about corrections during the calendar year and about administrative errors. See section 2 of Pub. 15 for more information about section 3509. If section 3509 rates apply, see the instructions for line 15, later.    You can’t file a Form 941-X to correct federal income tax withholding for prior years for nonadministrative errors. In other words, you can’t correct federal income tax actually withheld from an employee in a prior year if you discover that you didn’t withhold the right amount. For example, you can’t correct federal income tax withheld in a prior year because you used the wrong income tax withholding table in Pub. 15 or you didn’t treat a payment correctly as taxable or nontaxable. Similarly, if you paid federal income tax in a prior year on behalf of your employee, rather than deducting it from the employee’s pay (which resulted in additional wages subject to tax), and in a subsequent year you determine that you incorrectly calculated the amount of tax, you can’t correct the federal income tax withholding.  Example—Failure to withhold federal income tax when required. You were required to withhold $400 of federal income tax from an employee\\'s bonus that was paid in December of 2016 but you withheld nothing. You discovered the error on March 16, 2017. You can’t file Form 941-X to correct federal income tax withheld reported on your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941 because the error involves a previous year and the amount previously reported for the employee represents the actual amount withheld from the employee during 2016.   Example—Administrative error reporting federal income tax. You had three employees. In the fourth quarter of 2016, you withheld $1,000 of federal income tax from Xavier Black, $2,000 from Sophie Rose, and $6,000 from Leo Wood. The total amount of federal income tax you withheld was $9,000. You mistakenly reported $6,000 on line 3 of your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941. You discovered the error on March 13, 2017. This is an example of an administrative error that may be corrected in a later calendar year because the amount actually withheld from the employees\\' wages differs from the amount reported on Form 941. Use Form 941-X to correct the error. Enter $9,000 in column 1 and $6,000 in column 2. Subtract the amount in column 2 from the amount in column 1.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 9,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 3) - 6,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 3,000.00      Report the $3,000 as a tax correction in column 4. Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.   Example—Nonadministrative error reporting income tax due to repayment of wages paid in prior year. You paid Jack Brown $4,000 of wages for 2 months of work in September 2016. You withheld $400 of federal income tax at the time you paid Jack. These amounts were reported on your 2016 third quarter Form 941. Jack left employment in October 2016 (after only 1 month of service). After the end of the year, Jack repaid $2,000 to you. You can’t file Form 941-X to reduce the federal income tax withheld because you actually withheld the federal income tax from wages. You also can’t file Form 941-X to reduce wages because the wages were income to Jack for the prior year. These amounts were correctly reported on Form 941.      8. Taxable Social Security Wages If you’re correcting the taxable social security wages you reported on Form 941, line 5a, column 1, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.          line 8 (column 1)       - line 8 (column 2)       line 8 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.124 and enter that result in column 4.          line 8 (column 3)       x 0.124       line 8 (column 4)   If the amount in column 3 used a minus sign, also use a minus sign in column 4.        Note. If you’re correcting only the employer share of tax on a decrease to social security wages, use 0.062 (6.2%) when multiplying the amount shown in column 3. If you’re correcting both shares of tax for some employees and only the employer share for other employees, enter the properly calculated amount in column 4. Be sure to show your calculations on line 24.   Example—Social security wages decreased. Following Example—Wages, tips, and other compensation decreased in the instructions for line 6, the wages that you counted twice were also taxable social security wages. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 7,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5a, column 1) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) -2,000.00        Use the difference in column 3 to determine your tax correction.         Column 3 (difference) -2,000.00     Tax rate (12.4%)  x 0.124     Column 4 (tax correction)   -248.00         Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.     9. Taxable Social Security Tips If you’re correcting the taxable social security tips you reported on Form 941, line 5b, column 1, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.           line 9 (column 1)       - line 9 (column 2)       line 9 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.124 and report that result in column 4.          line 9 (column 3)       x 0.124       line 9 (column 4)   If the amount in column 3 used a minus sign, also use a minus sign in column 4.        Note. If you’re correcting only the employer share of tax on a decrease to social security tips, use 0.062 (6.2%) when multiplying the amount shown in column 3. If you’re correcting both shares of tax for some employees and only the employer share for other employees, report the properly calculated amount in column 4. Be sure to show your calculations on line 24.   Example—Social security tips increased. Following the Example—Wages, tips, and other compensation increased in the instructions for line 6, the tips that you overlooked were also taxable social security tips. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 10,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5b, column 1) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 1,000.00        Use the difference in column 3 to determine your tax correction.         Column 3 (difference) 1,000.00     Tax rate (12.4%)  x 0.124     Column 4 (tax correction)  124.00         Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.     10. Taxable Medicare Wages and Tips If you’re correcting the taxable Medicare wages and tips you reported on Form 941, line 5c, column 1, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.           line 10 (column 1)         - line 10 (column 2)          line 10 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.029 (2.9% tax rate) and enter that result in column 4.           line 10 (column 3)         x 0.029         line 10 (column 4)   If the amount in column 3 used a minus sign, also use a minus sign in column 4.        Note. If you’re correcting only the employer share of tax on a decrease to Medicare wages and tips, use 0.0145 (1.45%) when multiplying the amount in column 3. If you’re correcting both shares of tax for some employees and only the employer share for other employees, enter the properly calculated amount in column 4. Be sure to explain your calculations on line 24.   Example—Medicare wages and tips decreased. Following Example—Wages, tips, and other compensation decreased in the instructions for line 6, the wages that you counted twice were also taxable Medicare wages and tips. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) 7,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5c, column 1) - 9,000.00     Column 3 (difference) -2,000.00        Use the difference in column 3 to determine your tax correction.         Column 3 (difference)  -2,000.00     Tax rate (2.9%) x 0.029     Column 4 (tax correction)  -58.00        Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.      11. Taxable Wages and Tips Subject to Additional Medicare Tax Withholding Generally, you may correct errors to Additional Medicare Tax withholding only if you discovered the errors in the same calendar year the wages and tips were paid to employees. However, you may correct errors to Additional Medicare Tax withholding for prior years if the amount reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 2, doesn’t agree with the amount you actually withheld, including any amount you paid on behalf of your employee rather than deducting it from the employee’s pay (which resulted in additional wages subject to tax). This type of error is an administrative error. You may also correct errors to Additional Medicare Tax withholding for prior years if section 3509 rates apply. If section 3509 rates apply, see the instructions for line 18. If a prior year error was a nonadministrative error, you may correct only the wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding that were originally reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 1, or previously corrected on Form 941-X. You can’t correct the tax reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 2.  Errors discovered in the same calendar year or prior year administrative errors.  If you’re correcting the taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding that you reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 1, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.             line 11 (column 1)         - line 11 (column 2)          line 11 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate) and enter that result in column 4.           line 11 (column 3)         x 0.009         line 11 (column 4)   If the amount in column 3 used a minus sign, also use a minus sign in column 4.           Example—Prior year administrative error (incorrectly reported amount of Additional Medicare Tax actually withheld). Xavier Black\\'s wages exceeded the $200,000 withholding threshold for Additional Medicare Tax in November 2016. The total wages paid to Xavier for 2016 were $230,000. You withheld $270 ($30,000 x 0.009) from the Xavier\\'s wages. However, on your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941 you mistakenly reported $3,000 on line 5d, column 1, and Additional Medicare Tax withheld of $27 on line 5d, column 2. You discover the error on March 16, 2017. This is an example of an administrative error that may be corrected in a later calendar year because the amount actually withheld differs from the amount reported on your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941. Use Form 941-X, line 11, to correct the error as shown below.           Column 1 (corrected amount) 30,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5d, column 1) - 3,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 27,000.00        Use the difference in column 3 to determine your tax correction.         Column 3 (difference)  27,000.00     Tax rate (0.9%)  x 0.009     Column 4 (tax correction)     243.00        Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.   Prior year nonadministrative errors.  You may correct only the taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding that you reported on Form 941, line 5d, column 1. Enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.             line 11 (column 1)         - line 11 (column 2)          line 11 (column 3)   If the amount in column 2 is larger than the amount in column 1, use a minus sign in column 3.      Don’t multiply the amount in column 3 by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate). Leave column 4 blank and explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.      Example—Prior year nonadministrative error (failure to withhold Additional Medicare Tax when required). Sophie Rose’s wages exceeded the $200,000 withholding threshold for Additional Medicare Tax in December 2016. The total wages paid to Sophie for 2016 were $220,000. You were required to withhold $180 ($20,000 x 0.009) but you withheld nothing and didn’t report an amount on line 5d of your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941. You discover the error on March 16, 2017. File Form 941-X to correct wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding for your 2016 fourth quarter Form 941, but you may not correct the Additional Medicare Tax withheld (column 4) because the error involves a previous year and the amount previously reported for Sophie represents the actual amount withheld from Sophie during 2016.   Combination of prior year administrative and nonadministrative errors.  If you’re reporting both administrative errors and nonadministrative errors for the same quarter of a prior year, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2. However, multiply only the amount of wages and tips reported in column 3 that are related to administrative errors by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate). Don’t multiply any wages and tips reported in column 3 that are related to nonadministrative errors by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate). Use line 24 to explain in detail your corrections. The explanation must include the reasons for the corrections and a breakdown of the amount reported in column 3 into the amounts related to administrative errors and nonadministrative errors.      Example—Combination of prior year administrative and nonadministrative errors. Xavier Black’s wages exceeded the $200,000 withholding threshold for Additional Medicare Tax in November 2016. The total wages paid to Xavier for 2016 were $230,000. You withheld $270 ($30,000 x 0.009) from Xavier\\'s wages. However, on your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941 you mistakenly reported $3,000 on line 5d, column 1, and Additional Medicare Tax withheld of $27 on line 5d, column 2. The difference in wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax related to this administrative error is $27,000 ($30,000 - $3,000). Sophie Rose‘s wages exceeded the $200,000 withholding threshold for Additional Medicare Tax in December 2016. The total wages paid to Sophie for 2016 were $220,000. You were required to withhold $180 ($20,000 x 0.009) but you withheld nothing and didn’t report Sophie\\'s $20,000 in wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding on line 5d of your fourth quarter 2016 Form 941. You discover both errors on March 16, 2017. Use Form 941-X, line 11, to correct the errors as shown below.           Column 1 (corrected amount) 50,000.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 5d, column 1) - 3,000.00     Column 3 (difference) 47,000.00        Determine the portion of wages and tips reported in column 3 that is related to the administrative error ($47,000 - $20,000 (nonadministrative error) = $27,000 (administrative error)). Multiply this portion of column 3 by 0.009 (0.9% tax rate) to determine your tax correction.           Difference related to administrative error  27,000.00     Tax rate (0.9%) x 0.009     Column 4 (tax correction)  243.00        Be sure to explain the reasons for these corrections on line 24. You must also report that $20,000 of the amount shown in column 3 was related to the correction of a prior year nonadministrative error and $27,000 of the amount shown in column 3 was related to the correction of an administrative error.      12. Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand—Tax on Unreported Tips Enter any corrections, including amounts reported on Form 941, line 5f, to the tax due from a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand on line 12. The IRS issues a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand to advise an employer of the amount of tips received by employees who failed to report or underreported tips to the employer. An employer isn’t liable for the employer share of the social security and Medicare taxes on unreported tips until a Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand for the taxes is made to the employer by the IRS.     13. Tax Adjustments Use line 13 to correct any adjustments reported on Form 941, lines 7–9. Enter in column 1 the total corrected amount for Form 941, lines 7–9. Enter in column 2 the total originally reported or previously corrected amounts from Form 941, lines 7–9. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2.          line 13 (column 1)       -line 13 (column 2)        line 13 (column 3)             You may need to report negative numbers in any column. Make sure that the difference you enter in column 3 accurately represents the change to adjustments originally reported or previously corrected on Form 941, lines 7–9. Copy the amount in column 3 to column 4. Include any minus sign shown in column 3. On line 24, describe what you misreported on Form 941. Tell us if your adjustment is for fractions of cents, third-party sick pay, tips, or group-term life insurance.  Example—Current quarter\\'s third-party sick pay underreported. You reported $6,900 (shown as \"-6,900.00\") as a third-party sick pay adjustment (reduction to tax) on line 8 of your 2016 second quarter Form 941. You didn’t report any amounts on lines 7 and 9. Your third-party sick pay adjustment should’ve been $9,600 (shown as \"-9,600.00\") because your third-party sick pay payer withheld that amount of social security and Medicare taxes from your employees. You discovered the error in April of 2017. To correct the error, figure the difference on Form 941-X as shown.         Column 1 (corrected amount) -9,600.00     Column 2 (Form 941, line 8) - (6,900.00)     Column 3 (difference) -2,700.00        Here is how you would enter the numbers on Form 941-X.         Column 1 Column 2  Column 3   (corrected amount) (Form 941, line 8) (difference)    -9,600.00 -6,900.00 -2,700.00      Report \"-2,700.00\" as your correction in column 4.  In this example, you’re claiming a credit for $2,700 in overreported tax for your 2016 second quarter Form 941. Always enter the same amount in column 4 (including any minus sign) that you enter in column 3. Be sure to explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.      14. Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities If you’re correcting the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities that you reported on Form 941, line 11, enter the total corrected amount in column 1. In column 2, enter the amount you originally reported or as previously corrected. In column 3, enter the difference between columns 1 and 2. Copy the amount in column 3 to column 4. However, to properly show the amount as a credit or balance due item, enter a positive number in column 3 as a negative number in column 4 or a negative number in column 3 as a positive number in column 4. You must attach a corrected Form 8974 and explain the reasons for this correction on line 24.     15–18. Special Additions to Wages for Federal Income Tax, Social Security Taxes, Medicare Taxes, and Additional Medicare Tax Section 3509 provides special rates for the employee share of income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, and Additional Medicare Tax withholding when workers are reclassified as employees in certain circumstances. The applicable rate depends on whether you filed required information returns. An employer can’t recover any tax paid under this provision from the employees. The full employer share of social security tax and Medicare tax is due for all reclassifications.   Note. Section 3509 rates aren’t available if you intentionally disregarded the requirements to withhold taxes from the employee, or if you withheld income tax but didn’t withhold social security and Medicare taxes. Section 3509 rates are also not available for certain statutory employees.  On lines 15–18 enter only corrections to wages resulting from reclassifying certain workers as employees when section 3509 rates are used to calculate the taxes. If the employer issued the required information returns, use the section 3509 rates as follows.  For social security taxes, use the employer rate of 6.2% plus 20% of the employee rate of 6.2%, for a total rate of 7.44% of wages. For Medicare taxes, use the employer rate of 1.45% plus 20% of the employee rate of 1.45%, for a total rate of 1.74% of wages. For Additional Medicare Tax; 0.18% (20% of the employee rate of 0.9%) of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. For income tax withholding, the rate is 1.5% of wages.    If the employer didn’t issue the required information returns, use the section 3509 rates as follows.  For social security taxes, use the employer rate of 6.2% plus 40% of the employee rate of 6.2%, for a total rate of 8.68% of wages. For Medicare taxes, use the employer rate of 1.45% plus 40% of the employee rate of 1.45%, for a total rate of 2.03% of wages. For Additional Medicare Tax; 0.36% (40% of the employee rate of 0.9%) of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. For income tax withholding, the rate is 3.0% of wages.    Unlike other lines on Form 941-X, enter in column 1 only the corrected wages for workers being reclassified, not the amount paid to all employees. Enter in column 2 previously reported wages (if any) to reclassified employees. To get the amount for column 4, use the applicable section 3509 rates. If you filed the required information returns for some employees but didn’t file them for other employees, be sure to use the applicable rates for each employee when calculating the amounts in column 4 and show your calculations on line 24. The tax correction in column 4 will be a positive number if you increased the amount of wages you previously reported. See the instructions for line 23, later, for more information.     19. Subtotal Combine the amounts from column 4 on lines 7–18.  Example. You entered \"1,400.00\" in column 4 on line 7, \"-500.00\" in column 4 on line 8, and \"-100.00\" in column 4 on line 10. Combine these amounts and enter \"800.00\" in column 4 on line 19.         Line 7 1,400.00     Line 8 -500.00     Line 10  -100.00     Line 19 800.00             20a. Claiming or Correcting the COBRA Premium Assistance Credit    The COBRA premium assistance credit was available to an employer for premiums paid on behalf of employees who were involuntarily terminated from employment between September 1, 2008 and May 31, 2010. The COBRA premium assistance credit isn’t available for individuals who were involuntarily terminated after May 31, 2010. Therefore, only in rare circumstances, such as instances where COBRA eligibility was delayed as a result of employer provided health insurance coverage following termination, will the credit be available. Enter 65% of the total COBRA premium assistance payments for all assistance-eligible individuals in column 1. Report the premium assistance payments on this line only after the assistance-eligible individual\\'s 35% share of the premium has been paid. For COBRA coverage provided under a self-insured plan, COBRA premium assistance is treated as having been made for each assistance-eligible individual who paid 35% of the COBRA premium. Don’t include the assistance-eligible individual\\'s 35% of the premium in the amount entered on this line. For tax periods ending before January 1, 2014, enter any COBRA premium assistance payments previously claimed on Form 941 or 941-SS, line 12a, in column 2. For tax periods beginning after December 31, 2013, enter -0- in column 2, unless you’re correcting a COBRA premium assistance payment previously reported on a Form 941-X. If you or the IRS previously corrected the amount reported, the amount entered in column 2 should take into account all previous corrections. Enter the difference between column 1 and 2 in column 3. Copy the amount in column 3 to column 4. However, to properly show the amount as a credit or balance due item, enter a positive number in column 3 as a negative number in column 4 or a negative number in column 3 as a positive number in column 4.    The COBRA premium assistance credit is treated as a credit on the first day of the return period (that is, January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). However, because the credit is now claimed on Form 941-X filed after submission of the Form 941, an employer that reduces its required deposits in anticipation of the credit will receive a system-generated notice reflecting a balance due and associated penalties and interest, if applicable. The balance due, including any related penalties and interest, resulting from the reduction in deposits in anticipation of the credit will be abated when the credit is applied. Such abatement will generally occur without any further action from the employer. Alternatively, to prevent triggering a system-generated balance due notice, the employer can make its deposits without a reduction in anticipation of the COBRA premium assistance credit and follow these instructions for claiming the COBRA premium assistance credit. For more information on the COBRA premium subsidy, visit IRS.gov and enter \"COBRA\" in the search box.     20b. Number of Individuals Provided COBRA Premium Assistance on line 20a Enter the total number of assistance-eligible individuals provided COBRA premium assistance in column 1. Count each assistance-eligible individual who paid a reduced COBRA premium in the quarter as one individual, whether or not the reduced premium was for insurance that covered more than one assistance-eligible individual. For example, if the reduced COBRA premium was for coverage for a former employee, spouse, and two children, you would include one individual in the number entered on line 20b for the premium assistance entered on line 20a. Further, each individual is reported only once per quarter. For example, an assistance-eligible individual who made monthly premium payments during the quarter would only be reported as one individual on line 20b for that quarter. For tax periods ending before January 1, 2014, enter the number of assistance-eligible individuals provided COBRA premium assistance previously reported on Form 941 or 941-SS, line 12b, in column 2. For tax periods beginning after December 31, 2013, enter -0- in column 2, unless you’re correcting a previously filed Form 941-X. If you or the IRS previously corrected the number of individuals reported, the number entered in column 2 should take into account all previous corrections.     21. Total Combine the amounts on lines 19 and 20a of column 4 and enter the result on line 21.  Your credit.  If the amount entered on line 21 is less than zero, for example, \"-115.00,\" you have a credit because you overreported your federal employment taxes.  If you checked the box on line 1, include this amount on Form 941, line 13 (\"Total deposits\" line), for the quarter during which you filed Form 941-X or Form 944 \"Total deposits\" line, for the year during which you filed Form 941-X. Don’t make any changes to your record of federal tax liability reported on Form 941, line 16, or Schedule B (Form 941), if your Form 941-X is filed timely. The amounts reported on the record should reflect your actual tax liability for the period. If you checked the box on line 2, you’re filing a claim for refund or abatement of the amount shown.    If your credit is less than $1, we will send a refund or apply it only if you ask us in writing to do so.    Amount you owe.  If the amount on line 21 is a positive number, you must pay the amount you owe by the time you file Form 941-X. You may not use any credit that you show on another Form 941-X to pay the amount you owe, even if you filed for the amount you owe and the credit at the same time. If you owe tax and are filing a timely Form 941-X, don’t file an amended Schedule B (Form 941) unless you were assessed an FTD penalty caused by an incorrect, incomplete, or missing Schedule B (Form 941). Don’t include the tax increase reported on Form 941-X on any amended Schedule B (Form 941) you file. If you owe tax and are filing a late Form 941-X, that is, after the due date for Form 941 for the quarter in which you discovered the error, you must file an amended Schedule B (Form 941) with the Form 941-X. Otherwise, the IRS may assess an \"averaged\" FTD penalty. The total tax reported on the \"Total liability for the quarter\" line of Schedule B (Form 941) must match the corrected tax (Form 941, line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017), combined with any correction reported on Form 941-X, line 19) for the quarter, less any previous abatements and interest-free tax assessments.    Payment methods. You may pay the amount you owe on line 21 electronically using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), by credit or debit card, or by a check or money order.  The preferred method of payment is EFTPS. For more information, visit EFTPS.gov, call EFTPS Customer Service at 1-800-555-4477 or 1-800-733-4829 (TDD), or see Pub. 966. To pay by credit or debit card, visit the IRS website at  IRS.gov/payments. If you pay by check or money order, make it payable to \"United States Treasury.\" On your check or money order, be sure to write your EIN, \"Form 941-X,\" the calendar quarter you corrected (for example, \"Quarter 2\"), and the calendar year of the quarter you corrected.     You don’t have to pay if the amount you owe is less than $1.      Previously assessed FTD penalty.  If line 21 reflects overreported tax and the IRS previously assessed an FTD penalty, you may be able to reduce the penalty. For more information, see the Instructions for Schedule B (Form 941).       Part 4: Explain Your Corrections for This Quarter    22. Correction of Both Underreported and Overreported Amounts Check the box on line 22 if any corrections you entered on lines 7-20a, column 3, reflect both underreported and overreported amounts.  Example. If you had an increase to social security wages of $15,000 for Xavier Black and a decrease to social security wages of $5,000 for Sophie Rose, you would enter $10,000 on line 8, column 3. That $10,000 represents the net change from corrections. On line 24, you must explain the reason for both the $15,000 increase and the $5,000 decrease.      23. Did You Reclassify Any Workers? Check the box on line 23 if you reclassified any workers to be independent contractors or nonemployees. Also check this box if the IRS (or you) determined that workers you treated as independent contractors or nonemployees should be classified as employees. On line 24, give us a detailed reason why any worker was reclassified and, if you used section 3509 rates on lines 15–18, for any worker reclassified as an employee, explain why section 3509 rates apply and what rates you used.  Return not filed because you didn’t treat any workers as employees.  If you didn’t previously file Form 941 because you mistakenly treated all workers as independent contractors or as nonemployees, file a Form 941 for each delinquent quarter. On each Form 941 for which you’re entitled to use section 3509 rates, complete the following steps.  Write                                \"Misclassified Employees\"                             in bold letters across the top margin of page 1. Enter a zero on line 12 (line 10 for quarters ending before January 1, 2017). Complete the signature area. Attach a completed Form 941-X (see instructions next).    On each Form 941-X complete the following steps.  Complete the top of Form 941-X, including the date you discovered the error. Enter the wage amounts on lines 15–18, column 1. Enter zeros on lines 15–18, column 2. Complete columns 3 and 4 as instructed in Part 3. Provide a detailed statement on line 24. Complete the signature area.       If you can’t use section 3509 rates (for example, because the workers you treated as nonemployees were certain statutory employees), file a Form 941 for each delinquent quarter. Write \"                      Misclassified Employees                   \" in bold letters across the top margin of page 1 of each Form 941. Complete Form 941 using the Instructions for Form 941. Attach a Form 941-X to each Form 941. Complete the top of Form 941-X, including the date you discovered the error, and provide a detailed explanation on line 24.       24. Explain Your Corrections Treasury regulations require you to explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to support each correction. On line 24, describe in detail each correction you entered in column 4 on lines 7-18 and 20a. Also use line 24 to describe corrections made on lines 6 and 20b. If you need more space, attach additional sheets, but be sure to write your name, EIN, \"Form 941-X,\" the quarter you’re correcting (for example, \"Quarter 2\"), and the calendar year of the quarter you’re correcting on the top of each sheet. You must describe the events that caused the underreported or overreported amounts. Explanations such as \"social security and Medicare wages were overstated\" or \"administrative/payroll errors were discovered\" or \"taxes were not withheld\" are insufficient and may delay processing your Form 941-X because the IRS may need to ask for a more complete explanation.  Provide the following information in your explanation for each correction.  Form 941-X line number(s) affected. Date you discovered the error. Difference (amount of the error). Cause of the error.  You may report the information in paragraph form. The following paragraph is an example.                 \"The $1,000 difference shown in column 3 on lines 6, 8, and 10 was discovered on May 15, 2017, during an internal payroll audit. We discovered that we included $1,000 of wages for one of our employees twice. This correction removes the reported wages that were never paid.\"               For corrections shown on lines 15–18, column 3, explain why the correction was necessary and attach any notice you received from the IRS.

Qué Hay de Nuevo  Consentimiento del empleado para apoyar una reclamación de reembolso.  El Aviso 2015-15, en inglés, proporciona orientación a los patronos sobre los requisitos a seguir para la utilización de los consentimientos de los empleados para apoyar el derecho a reclamar un reembolso de la contribución al Seguro Social y de la contribución al Medicare recaudadas en exceso. El aviso y el procedimiento contributivo propuesto aclaran los requisitos básicos para una solicitud de consentimiento y el consentimiento del empleado en sí, y permite que un consentimiento se pida, se proporcione y se retenga en un formato electrónico como forma alternativa a un formato en papel. El aviso también solicita comentarios y contiene orientación sobre lo que constituye \"esfuerzos razonables\", en caso de que un consentimiento no se obtenga para permitir que el patrono reclame el reembolso de la parte correspondiente al patrono de la contribución al Seguro Social y de la contribución al Medicare recaudadas en exceso. Para obtener más información, consulte el Aviso 2015-15, que se encuentra en la  página 687 del Internal Revenue Bulletin (Boletín de Rentas Internas) 2015-9, disponible en inglés, en www.irs.gov/irb/2015-9_IRB/ar07.html.

El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA no está disponible para las personas que fueron cesadas involuntariamente después del 31 de mayo de 2010. Por lo tanto, sólo en circunstancias fuera de lo común el crédito está disponible, tal como los casos en que la elegibilidad de COBRA se haya retrasado a consecuencia de la cobertura de seguro de salud provista por el patrono después del cese.

Instrucciones Generales:Información para entender el Formulario 941-X (PR)     ¿Cuál es el propósito del Formulario 941-X (PR)?    Para los períodos contributivos que comienzan después del 31 de diciembre de 2013, el Formulario 941-PR no se puede utilizar para reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA.

Cuando descubra un error en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente, usted tiene que:  Corregir el error por medio del Formulario 941-X (PR), Radicar un Formulario 941-X (PR) por separado por cada Formulario 941-PR que está corrigiendo y Radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) por separado. No radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) junto con el Formulario 941-PR.    Si no radicó un Formulario 941-PR para uno o más trimestres, no use el Formulario 941-X (PR). En vez, radique el Formulario 941-PR por cada uno de esos trimestres. Consulte también el tema titulado ¿Cuándo debe radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, más adelante. Sin embargo, si no radicó el Formulario 941-PR debido a que trató (clasificó) incorrectamente a empleados como si fueran contratistas independientes o trabajadores que no son empleados (nonemployees) y ahora los reclasifica como empleados, consulte las instrucciones para la línea 22, más adelante.

Usted usará el proceso de ajuste si declaró contribuciones sobre la nómina insuficientes (de menos) y está haciendo un pago, o si declaró en exceso dichas contribuciones y estará aplicando el crédito al período del Formulario 941-PR durante el cual radica el Formulario 941-X (PR). No obstante, vea la Precaución, bajo el tema titulado ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, más adelante, si está corrigiendo cantidades declaradas en exceso durante los últimos 90 días del plazo de prescripción. Usará el proceso de reclamación si declaró contribuciones sobre la nómina en exceso y está solicitando el reembolso o la reducción de la cantidad declarada en exceso. Consulte la tabla en el dorso del Formulario 941-X (PR) para obtener información que le ayudará a determinar si debe utilizar el proceso de ajuste o el proceso de reclamación.

Radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) cuando descubra un error en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente. Sin embargo, si los únicos errores del Formulario 941-PR están relacionados con el número de empleados que recibieron salarios o con las obligaciones contributivas federales declaradas en la Parte 2 del Formulario 941-PR o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR), Registro de la Obligación Contributiva para los Depositantes de Itinerario Bisemanal, no radique el Formulario 941-X (PR).

Fechas de vencimiento.  La fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) depende de cuándo se descubrió el error y si se declararon las contribuciones de menos o en exceso. Si declaró contribuciones de menos, consulte el tema Contribución declarada de menos, más adelante. Para las contribuciones declaradas en exceso, puede optar por hacer un ajuste libre de intereses o por radicar una reclamación de reembolso o de reducción de contribuciones. Si está corrigiendo cantidades declaradas en exceso, consulte el tema Contribución declarada en exceso —proceso de ajuste, o el tema Contribución declarada en exceso —proceso de reclamación, a continuación. Si la fecha de vencimiento es un sábado, domingo o día feriado legal, puede radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) el próximo día laborable. Si recibimos el Formulario 941-X (PR) después de la fecha de vencimiento, se tratará dicho formulario como si hubiera sido radicado a tiempo si el sobre que contiene el Formulario 941-X (PR) está debidamente rotulado, tiene suficiente franqueo y el matasellos del Servicio Postal de los Estados Unidos está fechado a más tardar en la fecha de vencimiento, o si se envió por medio de un servicio de entrega privado aceptado por el IRS a más tardar en la fecha de vencimiento. Si no sigue estas pautas, consideramos que el Formulario 941-X (PR) fue radicado en la fecha en que realmente se recibió. Consulte la Pub. 179 (Circular PR) para obtener más información acerca de los días feriados oficiales y los servicios de entrega privados aceptados por el IRS.    Contribución declarada de menos.

Por lo general, si hace esto asegurará que su corrección sea libre de intereses y que no esté sujeta a multas por no pagar o no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés). Consulte el tema ¿Y las multas e intereses?, más adelante. Para más detalles sobre cómo efectuar un pago, vea las instrucciones de la línea 20, más adelante. Si se radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) tarde (después de la fecha de vencimiento de la planilla para el período de la planilla en el cual usted descubrió el error), tiene que adjuntar un Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) enmendado al Formulario 941-X (PR). De lo contrario, el IRS le podrá imponer una multa \"promediada\" por no depositar (FTD). El total de la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea \"                   Obligación total para el trimestre                \" del Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) tiene que ser igual a la cantidad total de contribuciones (línea 10 del Formulario 941-PR combinado con cualquier corrección declarada en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.              Si descubre el error en   El Formulario  941-X (PR) vence el                  1. enero, febrero, marzo       30 de abril     2. abril, mayo, junio       31 de julio     3. julio, agosto, septiembre       31 de octubre      4. octubre, noviembre, diciembre       31 de enero                  Las fechas indicadas en esta tabla corresponden sólo a las correcciones hechas debido a cantidades declaradas de menos. Si la fecha de vencimiento es un sábado, domingo o día feriado legal, puede radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) el próximo día laborable.      Ejemplo: Usted adeuda contribuciones. El 11 de febrero de 2015 descubre que declaró $10,000 de menos por concepto de salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014. Radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) y pague la cantidad que adeuda para el 30 de abril de 2015, porque descubrió el error en el primer trimestre de 2015 y el 30 de abril de 2015 es la fecha de vencimiento para ese trimestre. Si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) antes del 30 de abril de 2015, pague la cantidad que adeuda en el momento en que radica dicho formulario.   Contribución declarada en exceso —proceso de ajuste.  Si declaró contribuciones en exceso en el Formulario 941-PR y optó por aplicar el crédito al Formulario 941-PR o 944(SP), radique una planilla ajustada utilizando el Formulario 941-X (PR) tan pronto descubra el error, pero más de 90 días antes de que venza el plazo de prescripción para el crédito o reembolso del Formulario 941-PR. Consulte el tema titulado ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, más adelante.      Si usted redujo sus depósitos durante el trimestre por la cantidad del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA que se reflejará en su Formulario 941-X (PR), no use el proceso de ajuste para reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA. Use el proceso de reclamación. Vea las instrucciones para las  líneas 19a y 19b, más adelante.  Contribución declarada en exceso —proceso de reclamación.  Si declaró contribuciones en exceso en el Formulario 941-PR, puede optar por radicar una reclamación de reembolso o reducción de contribución en el Formulario 941-X (PR) en cualquier momento antes de que venza el período de prescripción para el crédito o reembolso del Formulario 941-PR. Si también necesita corregir cantidad alguna declarada de menos, tiene que radicar otro Formulario 941-X (PR) donde declara sólo las correcciones hechas por cantidades declaradas de menos. Consulte el tema ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, a continuación.      Usted no puede radicar una reclamación de reembolso para corregir la Contribución Adicional al Medicare retenida realmente de los empleados.     ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)? Por lo general, puede corregir las contribuciones declaradas en exceso en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) dentro de un plazo de 3 años a partir de la fecha en que radicó el Formulario 941-PR o 2 años a partir de la fecha en que pagó la contribución declarada en el Formulario 941-PR, lo que ocurra más tarde. Puede corregir contribuciones declaradas de menos en un Formulario 941-PR radicado anteriormente si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) dentro de 3 años de la fecha en que el Formulario 941-PR fue radicado. A cada uno de estos plazos se le llama \"plazo de prescripción\". Para propósitos del plazo de prescripción, los Formularios 941-PR que usted radicó para el año natural se consideran radicados el 15 de abril del próximo año natural si se radican antes de esa fecha.  Ejemplo. Usted radicó el Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2012 el 27 de enero de 2013 y los pagos fueron hechos a tiempo. El IRS tramita su planilla como si hubiera sido radicada el 15 de abril de 2013. El 22 de enero de 2016, usted descubre que declaró $350 en exceso por concepto de salarios sujetos a las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare en ese formulario. Para corregir el error, tiene que radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) a más tardar el 18 de abril de 2016, fecha en que finaliza el plazo de prescripción para el Formulario 941-PR, y usar el proceso de reclamación.     Si radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir cantidades declaradas en exceso en los últimos 90 días del plazo de prescripción, tiene que usar el proceso de reclamación. No puede usar el proceso de ajuste. Si también corrige cantidades declaradas de menos, tiene que radicar otro Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir las cantidades declaradas de menos utilizando el proceso de ajuste y tiene que pagar toda contribución adeudada.     ¿Adónde deberá enviar el Formulario 941-X (PR)? Complete y envíe su Formulario 941-X (PR) a la dirección que se le indica a continuación:       SI envía el  Formulario 941-X (PR) ENTONCES use esta  dirección    Desde Puerto Rico. . . .   Internal Revenue Service  P.O. Box 409101  Ogden, UT 84409     Dirección especial para la radicación por parte de organizaciones exentas; entidades gubernamentales federales, estatales y locales; entidades de gobiernos tribales indios sin consideración de su ubicación. . . .   Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service  Ogden, UT 84201-0005           ¿Cómo se debe completar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?    Use un Formulario 941-X (PR) por separado para cada trimestre que corrija Use un Formulario 941-X (PR) por separado para cada Formulario 941-PR que corrija. Por ejemplo, si encontró errores en sus Formularios 941-PR del tercer y cuarto trimestre de 2014, radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir el Formulario 941-PR del tercer trimestre de 2014. Radique un segundo Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir el Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014.     Número de identificación patronal, nombre y dirección Anote su número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés), nombre y dirección en los espacios provistos. También anote su nombre y su EIN en la parte superior de las páginas 2 y 3, y en todo documento adjunto. Si su dirección ha cambiado desde que radicó el Formulario 941-PR, anote la información corregida y el IRS actualizará su dirección en sus registros. Asegúrese de escribir su nombre, EIN, \"Formulario 941-X (PR)\", el trimestre natural que está corrigiendo (por ejemplo, \"2do Trimestre\") y el año natural del trimestre que está corrigiendo en la parte superior de todo documento que adjunte.     Planilla que está corrigiendo Marque la casilla para el Formulario 941-PR que aparece en el encasillado en la parte superior derecha de la página 1 del Formulario 941-X (PR). Luego marque la casilla para indicar el trimestre (sólo uno) que está corrigiendo. Anote el año natural que le corresponde al Formulario 941-PR que está corrigiendo. Anote el trimestre y el año natural en las páginas 2 y 3. Asegúrese de escribir su nombre, EIN, \"Formulario 941-X (PR)\", el trimestre que está corrigiendo (por ejemplo, \"2do Trimestre\") y el año natural del trimestre que está corrigiendo en la parte superior de todo documento que adjunte.     Anote la fecha en que descubrió los errores Usted tiene que anotar la fecha en que descubrió los errores. Usted descubre un error cuando tiene suficiente información para poder corregirlo. Si está declarando varios errores que descubrió en momentos distintos, anote la fecha más temprana en que los descubrió. Declare en la línea 23 las fechas subsiguientes y los errores correspondientes.     ¿Tiene que hacer una anotación en cada línea? Tiene que facilitar toda la información solicitada en la parte superior de la página 1. Tiene que marcar una casilla (pero no ambas) en la Parte 1. En la Parte 2, tiene que marcar la casilla en la línea 3 y toda casilla que le corresponda en las líneas 4 y 5. En la Parte 3, si no le corresponde alguna línea, déjela en blanco. Complete las Partes 4 y 5 tal como se le indica.     ¿Cómo debe declarar una cantidad negativa? El Formulario 941-X (PR) usa cifras negativas para indicar las reducciones en contribuciones (créditos) y cifras positivas para indicar contribuciones adicionales (cantidades que usted adeuda). Al declarar una cantidad negativa en las columnas 3 y 4, use un signo de menos en vez de usar paréntesis. Por ejemplo, anote \"-10.59\" en vez de \"(10.59)\". Sin embargo, si está completando la planilla en su computadora y el software sólo le permite usar paréntesis para declarar cantidades negativas, puede usarlos.     ¿Cómo se deben hacer anotaciones en el Formulario 941-X (PR)? Usted puede ayudar al IRS a tramitar el Formulario 941-X (PR) con mayor diligencia y exactitud si sigue las siguientes pautas:  Escriba a maquinilla o en letra de molde. Use la fuente Courier (si es posible) para toda anotación hecha a maquinilla o por computadora. Omita los signos de dólar. Puede usar comas y puntos decimales, si así lo prefiere. Anote las cantidades en dólares a la izquierda del punto decimal que aparece impreso y la cantidad de centavos a la derecha de dicho punto. Siempre anote la cantidad de centavos. No redondee las cifras (cantidades) a dólares enteros. Complete las tres páginas y firme el Formulario 941-X (PR) en la página 3. Engrape las páginas en conjunto en la esquina superior izquierda.        ¿Y las multas e intereses? Por lo general, la corrección que hace debido a una cantidad declarada de menos no estará sujeta a una multa por no pagar, multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) o intereses si usted:  Radica a tiempo (para la fecha de vencimiento del trimestre en que descubrió el error), Paga la cantidad indicada en la línea 20  en el momento que radica el Formulario 941-X (PR), Anota la fecha en que descubrió el error y Explica en detalle las razones y los hechos en que se basa para hacer la corrección.    Ninguna corrección cumplirá con los requisitos del trato libre de intereses si alguno de los siguientes aplica:  Las cantidades declaradas de menos están relacionadas con un tema que surgió durante una revisión de un período anterior. Usted a sabiendas declaró de menos su obligación contributiva sobre la nómina. Recibió una notificación y solicitud de pago. Recibió una carta titulada, Notice of Determination of Worker Classification (Determinación de la clasificación de un trabajador), en inglés.    Si recibe una notificación sobre una multa después que radica esta declaración, responda a la notificación con una explicación y determinaremos si cumple los requisitos de lo que se consideran causas razonables. No adjunte dicha explicación cuando radique su declaración.      Reseña del proceso El proceso para un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente o para radicar una reclamación de reembolso se explica en términos generales a continuación.    Si declaró la contribución de menos. Si declaró la contribución de menos en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente, marque la casilla en la línea 1 y pague toda cantidad adicional que adeuda en el momento en que radica el Formulario 941-X (PR). Para más detalles sobre cómo efectuar un pago, vea las instrucciones para la línea 20, más adelante.   Ejemplo: Usted declaró contribuciones sobre la nómina de menos. El 19 de junio de 2015, descubrió un error que resulta en contribuciones adicionales en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014. Radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) para el 31 de julio de 2015 y pague la cantidad que adeuda en el momento en que radique. Consulte el tema ¿Cuándo debe radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, anteriormente. No adjunte el Formulario 941-X (PR) a su Formulario 941-PR del segundo trimestre de 2015.     Si declaró contribuciones en exceso. Si declaró contribuciones en exceso en un Formulario 941-PR que radicó anteriormente, puede optar por una de las siguientes opciones:   Usar el proceso de ajuste. Marque la casilla en la línea 1 para que se le aplique todo crédito (cantidad negativa) de la línea 20 al Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre en que radica el Formulario 941-X (PR).  Usar el proceso de reclamación. Marque la casilla en la línea 2 para radicar una reclamación en el Formulario  941-X (PR) solicitando el reembolso o reducción de la cantidad indicada en la línea 20.       Para asegurar que el IRS tenga el tiempo suficiente para tramitar un crédito por un ajuste hecho por declarar en exceso en el trimestre en el cual radica el Formulario 941-X (PR), se le recomienda radicar en los 2 primeros meses del trimestre un Formulario 941-X (PR) que corrige la cantidad declarada en exceso. Por ejemplo, si descubre una cantidad declarada en exceso en marzo, junio, septiembre o diciembre, quizás quiera radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) en los 2 primeros meses del siguiente trimestre. No obstante, tienen que quedar 90 días en el plazo de prescripción cuando radique el Formulario 941-X (PR).  Vea la Precaución, bajo el tema titulado ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, anteriormente. Esto debería asegurar que el IRS tenga suficiente tiempo para tramitar el Formulario 941-X (PR) de manera que el crédito sea registrado antes de que usted radique el Formulario 941-PR a fin de evitar que el IRS le envíe erróneamente una notificación de saldo adeudado. Lea el ejemplo a continuación.   Ejemplo: Usted quiere que se le aplique la contribución pagada en exceso como crédito en el Formulario 941-PR. El 19 de junio de 2015, descubre que declaró contribuciones en exceso en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014 y quiere optar por el proceso de ajuste. Para permitir que el IRS tenga el tiempo suficiente para tramitar el crédito, radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) el 1 de julio de 2015 y tome el crédito en su Formulario 941-PR para el tercer trimestre de 2015.       Si en la actualidad radica el Formulario 944(SP) en vez del Formulario 941-PR y reclamará un crédito en el Formulario 944(SP), radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) antes de diciembre en cualquier año antes del vencimiento del plazo de prescripción en el Formulario 941-PR. En el año de vencimiento del plazo de prescripción para el Formulario 941-PR, radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) por lo menos 90 días antes de que venza el plazo de prescripción.     Instrucciones Específicas:    Parte 1: Escoja SÓLO un proceso Debido a que el Formulario 941-X (PR) puede ser usado para radicar una planilla de contribución ajustada o una reclamación de reembolso de las contribuciones, usted tiene que marcar una de las casillas en la línea 1 o en la línea 2. No marque ambas casillas.    1. Planilla ajustada de la contribución sobre la nómina Marque la casilla en la línea 1 si está corrigiendo cantidades declaradas de menos o cantidades declaradas en exceso y le gustaría usar el proceso de ajuste para corregir los errores. Si corrige ambas cantidades (las cantidades declaradas de menos y las cantidades declaradas en exceso) en este formulario, tiene que marcar esta casilla. Si marca esta casilla, toda cantidad negativa indicada en la línea 20 se aplicará como crédito (depósito contributivo) en su Formulario 941-PR o Formulario 944(SP) para el período en el cual usted está radicando este formulario. Consulte Ejemplo: Usted quiere que se le aplique la contribución pagada en exceso como crédito en el Formulario 941-PR, anteriormente.  Si adeuda contribuciones.  Pague la cantidad indicada en la línea 20 en el momento en que radica el Formulario 941-X (PR). Por lo general, no se le cobrarán intereses si radica a tiempo, paga a tiempo, anota la fecha en que descubrió los errores y explica las correcciones en la línea 23.    Si tiene un crédito.  Usted declaró contribuciones sobre la nómina en exceso (tiene una cantidad negativa en la línea 20) y quiere que el IRS le aplique el crédito en el Formulario 941-PR o en el Formulario 944(SP) para el período durante el cual usted radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR). El IRS le aplicará el crédito en el primer día del período del Formulario 941-PR o del Formulario 944(SP) en el que radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR). Sin embargo, el crédito que indica en la línea 20 del Formulario 941-X (PR) quizás no esté completamente disponible en su Formulario 941-PR o Formulario 944(SP) si el IRS lo corrige durante la tramitación o si usted adeuda otras contribuciones, multas o intereses. El IRS le notificará si su crédito reclamado cambia o si la cantidad disponible por concepto de crédito en el Formulario 941-PR o Formulario 944(SP) fue reducida debido a contribuciones, multas o intereses no pagados.      No marque la casilla en la línea 1 si está: (a) corrigiendo cantidades declaradas en exceso y el plazo de prescripción para el crédito y reembolso del Formulario 941-PR vencerá dentro de 90 días de la fecha en que radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR), o (b) reclamando un crédito por pagos de asistencia para las primas de COBRA y redujo sus depósitos en anticipación del crédito. En vez de esto, y en ambos casos, marque la casilla en la línea 2 para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR) siguiendo el proceso de reclamación. Consulte la sección ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, anteriormente. Además, vea las instrucciones para las líneas  19a  y  19b , más adelante.     2. Reclamación Marque la casilla en la línea 2 para usar el proceso de reclamación si corrige sólo cantidades declaradas en exceso y está reclamando un reembolso o reducción de la cantidad negativa (crédito) indicada en la línea 20. No marque esta casilla si corrige cantidad alguna declarada de menos en este formulario. Tiene que marcar la casilla en la línea 2 si tiene un crédito y el plazo de prescripción para hacer cambios al Formulario 941-PR vence dentro de 90 días de la fecha en que radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR). Consulte la sección ¿Existe una fecha de vencimiento para radicar el Formulario 941-X (PR)?, anteriormente. El IRS normalmente tramita las reclamaciones poco después de que sean radicadas. El IRS le notificará si su reclamación es denegada, si es aceptada tal como se radicó o si se escoge para ser revisada. Consulte la Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund (Revisión de planillas, sus derechos de apelación y las reclamaciones de reembolso), en inglés, para saber más información sobre este tema. A menos que el IRS corrija el Formulario 941-X (PR) durante la tramitación de dicho formulario o usted adeude otras contribuciones, multas o intereses, el IRS le reembolsará la cantidad indicada en la línea 20 más todos los intereses que le correspondan.     Usted no puede radicar una reclamación de reembolso para corregir la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que en realidad fue retenida de los empleados.     Parte 2: Complete las certificaciones Tiene que completar todas las certificaciones que le corresponden marcando las casillas apropiadas. Si todas sus correcciones conciernen a cantidades declaradas de menos, complete sólo la línea 3; omita las líneas 4 y 5 y siga a la Parte 3. Si sus correcciones conciernen a cantidades declaradas en exceso, usted tiene el deber de asegurar que se protejan los derechos de sus empleados de recuperar las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare pagadas en exceso que usted retuvo. Las certificaciones en las líneas 4 y 5 están dirigidas a los requisitos para:  Pagarles o reintegrarles a sus empleados la recaudación en exceso de la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare u Obtener la autorización de sus empleados para que usted radique una reclamación en nombre de ellos. Vea el  Aviso 2015-15, disponible en inglés, para obtener una orientación sobre autorizaciones.       3. Radicación de los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR o Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR Marque la casilla en la línea 3 para certificar que radicó o radicará los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR o Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR, con el Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico y con la Administración del Seguro Social (SSA, por sus siglas en inglés), tal como se requiera, que indiquen las cantidades correctas de salarios y contribuciones de sus empleados. Consulte las instrucciones para el Formulario 499R-2/W-2PR y las Instrucciones para el Formulario W-3PR para obtener información detallada sobre los requisitos de radicación. Tiene que marcar la casilla en la línea 3 para certificar que ha radicado los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR o Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR aun si sus correcciones en el Formulario 941-X (PR) no cambian las cantidades indicadas en dichos formularios. Por ejemplo, si su única corrección al Formulario 941-PR tiene que ver con ajustes contributivos declarados incorrectamente (consulte las instrucciones para la línea 13, más adelante), marque la casilla en la línea 3 para certificar que ya ha radicado todos los Formularios 499R-2/W-2PR y Formularios 499R-2c/W-2cPR requeridos con el Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico y con la SSA.     4. Certificación de los ajustes hechos por declarar en exceso Si declaró las contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare o la Contribución Adicional al Medicare en exceso y marcó la casilla en la línea 1, marque la casilla correspondiente en la línea 4. Quizás necesite marcar más de una casilla. Si obtuvo declaraciones por escrito de algunos empleados pero no pudo encontrar a sus empleados u obtener declaraciones de los empleados que quedaban, marque todas las casillas que le correspondan. Provea un resumen en la línea 23 de la cantidad de las correcciones de ambos: para los empleados que le dieron declaraciones por escrito y para los empleados que no lo hicieron.  4a.  Marque la casilla en la línea 4a si la cantidad que declaró en exceso incluye la parte correspondiente al empleado afectado de las contribuciones recaudadas en exceso.

Está certificando que usted ajustó la Contribución Adicional al Medicare retenida de empleados en el año natural en curso solamente.  No envíe estas declaraciones al IRS. Consérvelas en sus archivos. Por lo general, todos los registros relacionados con las contribuciones sobre la nómina se tienen que conservar al menos 4 años.    4b.  Marque la casilla en la línea 4b para certificar que su cantidad declarada en exceso es sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono de las contribuciones por aquellos empleados a quienes no pudo encontrar o por aquellos que no le dieron a usted una declaración descrita en la línea 4a.    4c.  Marque la casilla en la línea 4c para certificar que la cantidad declarada en exceso es sólo por contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare o por la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que no le retuvo a sus empleados.       5. Certificación de las reclamaciones Si está radicando una reclamación por reembolso o reducción (descuento) de las contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare o de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare y marcó la casilla en la línea 2, marque la casilla correspondiente en la línea 5.

No envíe estas declaraciones y autorizaciones al IRS. Consérvelas en sus archivos. Por lo general, todos los registros relacionados con las contribuciones sobre la nómina se tienen que conservar al menos 4 años.   En ciertas situaciones, quizás no le haya pagado (devuelto) o reembolsado dichas contribuciones a sus empleados o no haya obtenido su autorización antes de radicar una reclamación, como en casos en que el plazo de prescripción sobre un crédito o reembolso está a punto de vencer. En dichas situaciones, radique el Formulario 941-X (PR) pero no marque una casilla en la línea 5. En la línea 23, declare que no les ha pagado (devuelto) ni reembolsado a los empleados ni ha obtenido sus autorizaciones en el momento en que radica su reclamación.

Indique en las columnas 1 y 2 de las líneas 8 a 11 las cantidades para todos sus empleados, no sólo para aquellos empleados cuyas cantidades está corrigiendo. Si la corrección que declara en la columna 4 incluye cantidades declaradas de menos y cantidades declaradas en exceso (consulte las instrucciones para la línea 21, más adelante), provea detalles para cada error en la línea 23. Debido a que circunstancias especiales les corresponden a las líneas 12 a 17 y las líneas 19a y 19b, lea las instrucciones para cada línea con sumo cuidado antes de anotar cantidades en las columnas.    Si previamente ajustó o enmendó el Formulario 941-PR por medio del Formulario 941-X (PR) o debido a un cambio como resultado de una revisión hecha por el IRS, indique cantidades en la columna 2 que incluyan esas correcciones declaradas previamente.     8. Salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social    La tasa para los años 2011 y 2012 de la contribución al Seguro Social que le corresponde al empleado era 4.2%. Si está corrigiendo los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social que declaró en la columna 1 de la línea 5a del Formulario 941-PR, anote la cantidad corregida total en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o la cantidad según se corrigió anteriormente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.

Línea 8 (columna 3)                x .124    (Use .104 para correcciones de una planilla de 2011 ó 2012).     Línea 8 (columna 4)    Si la cantidad en la columna 3 tenía un signo de menos, también use un signo de menos en la columna 4.        Nota: Si corrige sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono de las contribuciones sobre una disminución de salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social, use .062 (6.2%) cuando multiplique la cantidad indicada en la columna 3. Si corrige ambas partes de las contribuciones para algunos empleados y sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono para otros empleados, anote la cantidad calculada en la columna 4. Asegúrese de mostrar sus cálculos en la línea 23.     Ejemplo: Disminución de los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social. Usted declaró $9,000 por concepto del total de salarios, propinas y otra remuneración en el Formulario 941-PR del primer trimestre de 2015. En mayo de 2015, se da cuenta que en dos ocasiones incluyó $2,000 en salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social para el mismo empleado. Para corregir el error, calcule la diferencia en el Formulario 941-X (PR) de la siguiente manera:         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 7,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5a, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  9,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)    -2,000.00        Use la diferencia en la columna 3 para determinar su corrección contributiva:         Columna 3 (diferencia) -2,000.00     Tasa contributiva (12.4%)    × .124      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)     -248.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.     Nota: Si el ejemplo anterior era para una corrección a una planilla de 2011 ó 2012, la cantidad en la columna 3 se multiplicaría por .104.         9. Propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social    La tasa para los años 2011 y 2012 de la contribución al Seguro Social que le corresponde al empleado era 4.2%. Si está corrigiendo las propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social que declaró en la columna 1 de la línea 5b del Formulario 941-PR, anote el total de la cantidad corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que usted declaró originalmente o la cantidad tal como la corrigió anteriormente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 9 (columna 1)       -Línea 9 (columna 2)        Línea 9 (columna 3)  Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.      Multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .124 (use .104 para correcciones de una planilla de 2011 ó 2012) y declare el resultado en la columna 4.          Línea 9 (columna 3)                x .124    (Use .104 para correcciones de una planilla de 2011 ó 2012).     Línea 9 (columna 4)    Si la cantidad en la columna 3 tenía un signo de menos, también use un signo de menos en la columna 4.        Nota: Si está corrigiendo sólo la parte de las contribuciones correspondiente al patrono debido a la disminución en propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social, use .062 (6.2%) cuando multiplica la cantidad indicada en la columna 3. Si está corrigiendo ambas partes de las contribuciones para algunos empleados y sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono para otros empleados, declare la cantidad debidamente calculada en la columna 4. Asegúrese de mostrar sus cálculos en la línea 23.   Ejemplo: Aumento en propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social. Usted declaró $9,000 por concepto del total de salarios, propinas y otra remuneración en el Formulario 941-PR del primer trimestre de 2015. En mayo de 2015, se da cuenta que se le olvidó declarar $1,000 en propinas sujetas a la contribución al Seguro Social de uno de sus empleados que trabaja a tiempo parcial. Para corregir el error, calcule la diferencia en el Formulario 941-X (PR) tal como se le indica a continuación:         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 10,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5b, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  9,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)    1,000.00        Use la diferencia en la columna 3 para determinar su corrección contributiva:         Columna 3 (diferencia) 1,000.00     Tasa contributiva (12.4%)    × .124      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)     124.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.    Nota: Si el ejemplo anterior era para una corrección a una planilla de 2011 ó 2012, la cantidad en la columna 3 se multiplicaría por .104.      10. Salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare              Si está corrigiendo los salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare que declaró en la columna 1 de la línea 5c del Formulario 941-PR, anote el total de la cantidad corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o la cantidad tal como la corrigió anteriormente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 10 (columna 1)       -Línea 10 (columna 2)        Línea 10 (columna 3)  Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.      Multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .029 (tasa contributiva de 2.9%) y anote el resultado en la columna 4.          Línea 10 (columna 3)                x .029          Línea 10 (columna 4)    Si la cantidad en la columna 3 tenía un signo de menos, también use un signo de menos en la columna 4.        Nota: Si corrige sólo la parte correspondiente al patrono de las contribuciones en una disminución de los salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare, use .0145 (1.45%) cuando multiplica la cantidad en la columna 3. Si corrige ambas partes de la contribución para algunos empleados y sólo la parte correspondiente al empleado para otros empleados, anote la cantidad debidamente calculada en la columna 4. Asegúrese de explicar los cálculos en la línea 23.   Ejemplo: Disminución de los salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare. Usted declaró $9,000 por concepto del total de salarios, propinas y otra remuneración en el Formulario 941-PR del primer trimestre de 2015. En mayo de 2015, se da cuenta que en dos ocasiones incluyó $2,000 en salarios y propinas sujetos a la contribución al Medicare para el mismo empleado. Para corregir el error, calcule la diferencia en el Formulario 941-X (PR) de la siguiente manera:         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 7,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5c, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  9,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)   -2,000.00        Use la diferencia en la columna 3 para determinar su corrección contributiva:         Columna 3 (diferencia) -2,000.00     Tasa contributiva (2.9%)    × .029      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)     -58.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.      11. Salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al                    Medicare                              Por lo general, puede corregir errores a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare sólo si usted encontró los errores en el mismo año natural en el cual los salarios y propinas fueron pagados a los empleados. Sin embargo, puede corregir errores a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare para años anteriores si la cantidad declarada en la  línea 5d de la columna 2 del Formulario 941-PR no concuerda con la cantidad que en realidad retuvo. Esta clase de error es un error administrativo. También, puede corregir errores a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare para años anteriores si las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 aplican. Si las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 aplican, vea las instrucciones para la línea  17, más adelante. Si un error de un año anterior fue un error no administrativo, puede corregir sólo los salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que declaró originalmente en la  línea 5d de la columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR o corregidos previamente en el Formulario 941-X (PR). No puede corregir la contribución declarada en la  línea 5d de la columna 2 del Formulario 941-PR.  Errores descubiertos en el mismo año natural o errores administrativos de años anteriores.  Si está corrigiendo los salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que declaró en la  línea 5d de la columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR, anote la cantidad total corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o que corrigió previamente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 11 (columna 1)       -Línea 11 (columna 2)        Línea 11 (columna 3)  Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.        Multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%) y anote el resultado en la columna 4.          Línea 11 (columna 3)                x .009          Línea 11 (columna 4)    Si la cantidad en la columna 3 tenía un signo de menos, también use un signo de menos en la columna 4.       Ejemplo: Error administrativo de un año anterior (cantidad declarada incorrectamente de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare realmente retenida). En noviembre de 2014, el salario del Empleado A excedió del límite de $200,000 para la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Para el año 2014, el total de salarios pagados al Empleado A fue $230,000. Usted retuvo $270 ($30,000 x .009) de los salarios del empleado. Sin embargo, en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014, usted declaró erróneamente $3,000 en la línea 5d de la columna 1 y la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare de $27 en la línea 5d de la columna 2. Usted descubrió el error el 16 de marzo de 2015. Esto es un ejemplo de un error administrativo que puede corregir en un año natural más tarde debido a que la cantidad que realmente se retuvo es diferente a la cantidad que declaró en su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre del año 2014. Use la línea  11 del Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir el error, como se indica a continuación.         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 30,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5d, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  3,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)   27,000.00        Use la diferencia en la columna 3 para determinar su corrección contributiva.         Columna 3 (diferencia) 27,000.00     Tasa contributiva (0.9%)    × .009      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)   243.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea  23 las razones por las que hizo estas correcciones.   Errores no administrativos de años anteriores.  Usted puede corregir sólo los salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare que declaró en la  línea 5d de la columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR. Anote el total de la cantidad corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o que corrigió previamente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 11 (columna 1)       -Línea 11 (columna 2)        Línea 11 (columna 3)  Si la cantidad en la columna 2 es mayor que la cantidad de la columna 1, use un signo de menos en la columna 3.       No multiplique la cantidad en la columna 3 por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%). Deje la columna 4 en blanco y explique en la  línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.    Ejemplo: Error no administrativo de un año anterior (incumplimiento del requisito de retener la Contribución Adicional al Medicare). En diciembre de 2014, el salario del Empleado B excedió del límite superior de $200,000 para propósitos de la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Para el año 2014, el total de salarios pagados al Empleado B fue $220,000. Usted estaba obligado a retener $180 ($20,000 x .009), pero no lo retuvo ni tampoco declaró cantidad alguna en la línea 5d de su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014. Descubrió el error el 16 de marzo de 2015. Presente el Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir los salarios y propinas sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare para su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014, pero no puede corregir la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare (columna 4) porque el error tiene que ver con un año anterior y la cantidad previamente declarada para el empleado representa la cantidad actual retenida del empleado durante 2014.   Combinación de errores administrativos y errores no administrativos de un año anterior.  Si está declarando ambas clases de errores (administrativos y no administrativos) para el mismo trimestre de un año previo, anote el total de la cantidad corregida en la columna 1. En la columna 2, anote la cantidad que declaró originalmente o que corrigió previamente. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2. Sin embargo, multiplique sólo la cantidad de salarios y propinas declarada en la columna 3 que está relacionada con errores administrativos por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%). No multiplique los salarios y propinas declarados en la columna 3 que están relacionados con errores no administrativos por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%). Use la línea  23 para explicar en detalle sus correcciones. La explicación tiene que incluir las razones para las correcciones y un desglose del cálculo sobre la cantidad declarada en la columna 3 y cuáles cantidades están relacionadas con errores administrativos y errores no administrativos.    Ejemplo: Combinación de errores administrativos y errores no administrativos de un año anterior. En noviembre de 2014, el salario del Empleado A excedió del límite superior de $200,000 para propósitos de la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Para el año 2014, el total de salarios pagados al Empleado A fue $230,000. La cantidad que retuvo del salario fue $270 ($30,000 x .009). Sin embargo, usted erróneamente declaró $3,000 en la columna 1 de la línea 5d de su Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014, y declaró la cantidad de retención de $27 en la columna 2 de la línea 5d. La diferencia en los salarios sujetos a la Contribución Adicional al Medicare en relación con este error administrativo es $27,000 ($30,000 - $3,000). En diciembre de 2014, el salario del Empleado B excedió del límite superior de $200,000 para la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare. Para 2014, el total de salarios pagado al Empleado B fue $220,000. Usted estaba obligado a retener $180 ($20,000 x .009) pero no los retuvo ni tampoco declaró los $20,000 de salarios sujetos a la retención de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare del Empleado B en la línea 5d del Formulario 941-PR del cuarto trimestre de 2014. Usted descubrió ambos errores el 16 de marzo de 2015. Use la línea 11 del Formulario 941-X (PR) para corregir los errores, como se indica a continuación.         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) 50,000.00     Columna 2 (línea 5d, columna 1 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  3,000.00      Columna 3 (diferencia)   47,000.00        Determine la parte de los salarios y propinas declarada en la columna 3 que está relacionada con el error administrativo ($47,000 - $20,000 (error no administrativo) = $27,000 (error administrativo)). Multiplique esta parte de la columna 3 por .009 (tasa contributiva de 0.9%) para determinar su corrección contributiva:         Diferencia relacionada con el error administrativo 27,000.00     Tasa contributiva (0.9%)    × .009      Columna 4 (corrección contributiva)   243.00        Asegúrese de explicar en la línea  23 las razones por las que hizo estas correcciones. Además, tiene que informar que $20,000 de la cantidad indicada en la columna 3 está relacionada con la corrección de un error no administrativo de un año anterior y $27,000 de la cantidad indicada en la columna 3 está relacionada con la corrección de un error administrativo.      12. Notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q): Contribución adeudada por propinas no declaradas Anote toda corrección, incluyendo cantidades declaradas en la  línea 5e (para trimestres que terminaron en 2011 ó 2012) del Formulario 941-PR y cantidades declaradas en la  línea 5f (para trimestres que terminaron después de 2012) del Formulario 941-PR de la contribución adeudada que aparece en la Notice and Demand under Section 3121(q) (Notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q)), en inglés, en la  línea 12. El IRS emite esta notificación para informarle a un patrono de la cantidad de propinas recibidas por empleados que no fueron declaradas al IRS o propinas que no fueron declaradas al patrono. El patrono no es responsable de pagar la parte correspondiente al empleado de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare por las propinas no declaradas hasta que el IRS le emite una notificación y solicitud de pago conforme a la sección 3121(q) al patrono.     13. Ajustes a la contribución Use la línea 13 para corregir todo ajuste indicado en las líneas 7 a 9 del Formulario 941-PR. Anote en la columna 1 el total de las cantidades corregidas en las líneas 7 a 9 del Formulario 941-PR. Anote en la columna 2 el total de las cantidades declaradas originalmente o cantidades ajustadas previamente de las líneas 7 a 9 del Formulario 941-PR. En la columna 3, anote la diferencia entre las columnas 1 y 2.          Línea 13 (columna 1)       -Línea 13 (columna 2)        Línea 13 (columna 3)              Quizás necesite declarar cifras negativas en una columna. Asegúrese que la diferencia que anote en la columna 3 represente con exactitud los cambios a los ajustes que fueron declarados originalmente o corregidos previamente en las líneas 7 a 9 del Formulario 941-PR. Copie la cantidad de la columna 3 en la columna 4. Incluya todo signo de menos que aparezca en la columna 3. En la línea 23, describa lo que usted declaró erróneamente en el Formulario 941-PR. Indique si su ajuste es por fracciones de centavos, compensación por enfermedad pagada por terceros, propinas o seguro temporal de vida colectivo a término fijo.  Ejemplo: Declaración de menos de la compensación por enfermedad pagada por terceros en el trimestre en curso. Usted declaró $6,900 (que se indica como \"-6,900.00\") por concepto de un ajuste de la compensación por enfermedad pagada por terceros (reducción a la contribución) en la línea 8 de su Formulario 941-PR del segundo trimestre de 2014. No declaró ninguna cantidad en las líneas 7 ni 9. Su ajuste de la compensación por enfermedad pagada por terceros debió ser $9,600 (que se indica como \"-9,600.00\") porque su tercero pagador de la compensación por enfermedad retuvo dicha cantidad por concepto de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare de sus empleados. Usted descubrió el error en abril de 2015. Para corregir el error, calcule la diferencia en el Formulario 941-X (PR) como se indica a continuación:         Columna 1 (cantidad corregida) -9,600.00     Columna 2 (línea 8 del Formulario 941-PR)  -  (6,900.00)      Columna 3 (diferencia)    -2,700.00        Usted anotaría las cifras en el Formulario 941-X (PR) de la siguiente manera:          Columna 1 Columna 2 (línea 8  Columna 3   (cantidad corregida) del Formulario 941-PR) (diferencia)    -9,600.00 -6,900.00 -2,700.00      Declare \"-2,700.00\" como su corrección en la columna 4. En este ejemplo, usted reclama un crédito de $2,700 por concepto de contribuciones declaradas en exceso para su Formulario 941-PR del segundo trimestre de 2014. Anote siempre la misma cantidad en la columna 4 (incluyendo todo signo de menos) que usted anota en la columna 3.  Asegúrese de explicar en la línea 23 las razones por las que hizo esta corrección.     15-17. Aportaciones especiales a los salarios para las contribuciones al Seguro Social, al Medicare y la Contribución Adicional al                    Medicare                              En ciertas circunstancias, la sección 3509 establece tasas especiales para la parte correspondiente al empleado de la contribución al Seguro Social, de la contribución al Medicare y de la Contribución Adicional al Medicare cuando los trabajadores son reclasificados como empleados. La tasa correspondiente dependerá de si usted radicó las planillas informativas que se requieren. Un patrono no puede recuperar ninguna contribución pagada bajo esta disposición de los empleados. La parte completa del patrono de la contribución al Seguro Social y de la contribución al Medicare tiene que pagarse en toda situación de reclasificación.   Nota: Las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 no están disponibles si usted intencionalmente hizo caso omiso de los requisitos de la retención de contribuciones a los empleados. Las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 tampoco están disponibles para ciertos empleados estatutarios.  Los contribuyentes en Puerto Rico no deben completar la línea 14. En las líneas 15 a 17, anote sólo las correcciones hechas a salarios que son el resultado de la reclasificación de ciertos trabajadores como empleados cuando las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 se usan para calcular las contribuciones. Si el patrono radicó las planillas informativas que se requieren, use las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 de la siguiente manera:  Para las contribuciones al Seguro Social, use la tasa que le corresponde al patrono de 6.2% más el 20% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 6.2% (4.2% para los años 2011 y 2012), para una tasa total de 7.44% (7.04% para los años 2011 y 2012) de los salarios. Para las contribuciones al Medicare, use la tasa que le corresponde al patrono de 1.45% más el 20% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 1.45%, para una tasa total de 1.74% de los salarios. Para la Contribución Adicional al Medicare, el 0.18% (20% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 0.9%) de los salarios sujetos a la Contribución Adicional al Medicare.    Si el patrono no radicó las planillas informativas que se requieren, use las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 de la siguiente manera:  Para las contribuciones al Seguro Social, use la tasa que le corresponde al patrono de 6.2% más el 40% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 6.2% (4.2% para los años 2011 y 2012), para una tasa total de 8.68% (7.88% para los años 2011 y 2012) de los salarios. Para las contribuciones al Medicare, use la tasa que le corresponde al patrono de 1.45% más el 40% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 1.45%, para una tasa total de 2.03% de los salarios. Para la Contribucion Adicional al Medicare, el 0.36% (40% de la tasa que le corresponde al empleado de 0.9%) de los salarios sujetos a la Contribución Adicional al Medicare.    A diferencia de otras líneas en el Formulario 941-X (PR), anote en la columna 1 sólo los salarios corregidos relacionados con la reclasificación de trabajadores, no la cantidad pagada a TODOS los empleados. Anote la cantidad de salarios declarados correspondiente a los empleados reclasificados (si existe) en la columna 2. Para obtener la cantidad para la columna 4, use las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 que le correspondan. Si usted radicó las planillas informativas para algunos empleados, pero no lo hizo para otros, asegúrese de usar las tasas aplicables para cada empleado al calcular las cantidades en la columna 4 y mostrar sus cálculos en la  línea 23. La corrección contributiva en la columna 4 será una cifra positiva si aumentó la cantidad de salarios que había declarado anteriormente. Consulte las instrucciones para la línea 22, más adelante, para obtener más información.     18. Subtotal Combine las cantidades de la columna 4 de las líneas 8 a 17.  Ejemplo. Usted anotó \"1,400.00\" en la columna 4 de la línea 8; \"-500.00\" en la columna 4 de la línea 9; y \"-100.00\" en la columna 4 de la línea 10. Combine las cantidades y anote \"800.00\" en la columna 4 de la línea 18.         Línea 8  1,400.00     Línea 9  -500.00     Línea 10   -100.00      Línea 18  800.00             19a. Reclamación o corrección del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA                 El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA estuvo disponible a los patronos por las primas pagadas en nombre de empleados que fueron cesados involuntariamente de sus empleos entre el 1 de septiembre de 2008 y el 31 de mayo de 2010. El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA no está disponible para las personas que fueron cesadas involuntariamente después del 31 de mayo de 2010. Por lo tanto, sólo en ciertas circunstancias, el crédito estará disponible, como en casos en donde la elegibilidad a COBRA fue demorada como resultado de cobertura de seguro de salud provista por el patrono después del cese. Anote el 65% del total de pagos de asistencia para las primas de COBRA para todos los individuos que cumplen con los requisitos para la asistencia en la columna 1. Declare los pagos de asistencia para las primas en esta línea sólo después de que el 35% de la parte que le corresponde a los individuos que cumplen con los requisitos haya sido pagada. Para la cobertura de COBRA provista conforme a un plan de autoasegurados, la asistencia para las primas de COBRA es tratada como si hubiera sido hecha para cada individuo que cumple los requisitos para dicha asistencia que pagó el 35% de la prima. No incluya en esta línea el 35% de la prima que le corresponde al individuo que cumple los requisitos en la cantidad anotada en esta línea. Para los períodos contributivos que terminan antes del 1 de enero de 2014, anote en la columna 2 todo pago de asistencia para las primas de COBRA que fue reclamado previamente en la  línea 12a del Formulario 941-PR. Para los períodos contributivos que comienzan después del 31 de diciembre de 2013, anote \"-0-\" en la columna 2, a menos que esté corrigiendo un pago de asistencia para las primas de COBRA que declaró previamente en el Formulario 941-X (PR). Si usted o si el IRS corrigió previamente la cantidad declarada, la cantidad anotada en la columna 2 deberá incluir todas las correcciones que se hicieron previamente. Anote la diferencia entre la columna 1 y la columna 2 en la columna 3. Copie la cantidad de la columna 3 en la columna 4. No obstante, para mostrar debidamente la cantidad como partida de crédito o saldo adeudado, anote una cifra positiva de la columna 3 como cifra negativa en la columna 4; una cifra negativa de la columna 3 como cifra positiva en la columna 4.    El crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA se trata como un crédito en el primer día del período de su planilla (es decir, 1 de enero, 1 de abril, 1 de julio o el 1 de octubre). Sin embargo, debido a que el crédito ahora se reclama en el Formulario 941-X (PR) que se radica DESPUÉS de que se radique el Formulario 941-PR, un patrono que reduce sus depósitos requeridos en anticipación del crédito recibirá una notificación generada por el sistema reflejando un saldo además de multas e intereses correspondientes. El saldo adeudado como resultado de la reducción de los depósitos en anticipación del crédito, incluyendo toda multa e intereses correspondientes, se eliminará cuando se le aplique el crédito. Por lo general, tal eliminación ocurrirá sin requerir ninguna otra acción de parte del patrono. Como alternativa para evitar que se emita una notificación generada por el sistema con un saldo adeudado, el patrono puede efectuar sus depósitos sin aplicar la reducción en anticipación del crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA y seguir estas instrucciones para reclamar el crédito de asistencia para las primas de COBRA. Si desea más información sobre el subsidio de primas de COBRA, visite IRS.gov e ingrese                    \"COBRA\"                 en la casilla Search (Buscar), en inglés.     19b. Número de individuos que recibieron asistencia para las primas de COBRA declaradas en la línea 19a Anote en la columna 1 el número total de individuos que cumplen los requisitos para la asistencia para las primas de COBRA y que se les ha provisto dicha asistencia. Cuente a cada individuo que cumple los requisitos para dicha asistencia que pagó una prima reducida de COBRA para el trimestre como un individuo, sin tomar en cuenta si la prima reducida sea o no para seguro que cubrió a más de un individuo que cumple los requisitos de asistencia. Por ejemplo, si la prima reducida de COBRA fue para la cobertura de un ex empleado, su cónyuge y dos hijos, usted incluiría a un individuo en el número anotado en la línea 19b para la asistencia de las primas anotada en la línea 19a. Además, cada individuo es declarado sólo una vez por trimestre. Por ejemplo, un individuo que cumple los requisitos de la asistencia y que hizo pagos de prima mensuales durante el trimestre sería declarado como sólo un individuo en la línea 19b para ese trimestre. Para los períodos contributivos que terminan antes del 1 de enero de 2014, anote en la columna 2 la cantidad de individuos que cumplen los requisitos para la asistencia para las primas de COBRA declaradas previamente en la  línea 12b del Formulario 941-PR. Para los períodos contributivos que comienzan después del 31 de diciembre de 2013, anote \"-0-\" en la columna 2 a menos que esté corrigiendo un Formulario 941-X (PR) radicado previamente. Si usted o si el IRS corrigió previamente la cantidad de individuos declarados, la cantidad que anote en la columna 2 debe tomar en cuenta todas las correcciones previas.     20. Total  Combine las cantidades de la columna 4 de las líneas 18 y 19a y anote el resultado en la línea 20.  Su crédito.  Si la cantidad que anotó en la línea 20 es menos de cero, por ejemplo, \"-115.00\", usted tiene un crédito porque declaró en exceso sus contribuciones federales sobre la nómina.  Si marcó la casilla en la línea 1, incluya esta cantidad en la línea 11 (línea \"Total de depósitos...\") del Formulario 941-PR correspondiente al trimestre durante el cual radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR) o en la línea 8 (línea \"Total de depósitos...\") del Formulario 944(SP) para el año en el cual radicó el Formulario 941-X (PR). No haga ningún cambio a su registro de obligación contributiva federal declarada en la línea 14 del Formulario 941-PR o en el Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) si su Formulario 941-X (PR) es radicado a tiempo. Las cantidades declaradas en el registro deben reflejar su verdadera obligación contributiva para el período. Si marcó la casilla de la línea 2, usted está radicando una reclamación de reembolso o reducción por la cantidad que se indica.    Si su crédito es menos de $1, le enviaremos un reembolso o se lo aplicaremos como crédito sólo si lo solicita por escrito.    Cantidad que adeuda.  Si la cantidad en la línea 20 es una cifra positiva, tiene que pagar la cantidad que adeuda en el momento en que radique el Formulario 941-X (PR). No puede usar ningún crédito que indique en otro Formulario 941-X (PR) para pagar la cantidad adeudada, aun si radicó a causa de la cantidad adeudada y por el crédito a la misma vez. Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) a tiempo, no radique un Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) enmendado, a menos que se le haya impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) debido a un Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) que falta, que está incorrecto o que está incompleto. No incluya la cantidad de aumento en la contribución declarada en el Formulario 941-X (PR) en ningún Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) enmendado que usted radique. Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) tarde, eso es, después de la fecha de vencimiento del Formulario 941-PR para el trimestre en el que usted descubrió el error, tiene que radicar un Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) enmendado con el Formulario 941-X (PR). De otro modo, el IRS podría imponerle (gravarle) una multa \"promediada\" por no depositar. El total de obligación contributiva declarada en la línea \"                      Obligación total para el trimestre                   \" del Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) tiene que ser igual a la cantidad total de contribuciones (línea 10 del Formulario 941-PR combinado con cualquier corrección declarada en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.    Métodos de pago. Puede pagar la cantidad que adeuda en la línea 20 por medios electrónicos usando el sistema electrónico de pagos de la contribución federal (EFTPS, por sus siglas en inglés), con tarjeta de crédito o débito, o con cheque o giro.  El método preferido es el EFTPS. Para obtener más información, visite el sitio web www.eftps.gov, en inglés, llame al Servicio al Cliente del EFTPS al 1-800-244-4829 (o al 1-800-733-4839, si es usuario de equipo TDD) para recibir ayuda en español o vea la Pub. 966 (SP), Sistema de Pago Electrónico del Impuesto Federal: La Manera Segura de Pagar los Impuestos Federales.

Si paga mediante un cheque o giro, hágalo a la orden del                                   \"United States Treasury\"                                (Tesoro de los EE.UU.). Anote su EIN, \"Formulario 941-X (PR)\", el trimestre natural que está corrigiendo (por ejemplo, \"2do Trimestre\") y el año natural del trimestre que está corrigiendo.     No tiene que pagar si el saldo que adeuda es menos de $1.      Multa por no depositar que se le impuso anteriormente.

Correcciones de las cantidades declaradas de menos y las cantidades declaradas en exceso Marque la casilla en la línea 21 si cualquier corrección que anotó en la columna 3 de las líneas 8 a 19a refleja cantidades declaradas de menos y cantidades declaradas en exceso.  Ejemplo. Si tuvo un aumento de los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social de $15,000 para el Empleado A y una reducción de los salarios sujetos a la contribución al Seguro Social de $5,000 para el Empleado B, usted anotaría $10,000 en la columna 3 de la línea 8. Esos $10,000 representan el cambio neto a causa de la corrección. En la línea 23, tiene que dar las razones que explican el aumento de $15,000 y también la reducción de $5,000.      22. ¿Reclasificó a sus trabajadores? Marque la casilla en la línea 22 si reclasificó a algún empleado como contratista independiente o como \"trabajador que no es empleado\" (trabajador que no está en nómina). También marque esta casilla si el IRS (o usted) determinó que los trabajadores que usted trató como contratistas independientes o trabajadores que no son empleados deberían estar clasificados como empleados. En la línea 23 provea una razón detallada que explique por qué reclasificó a un trabajador y, si usó tasas conforme a la sección 3509 en las líneas 15 a 17 para un trabajador que fue reclasificado como empleado, explique por qué le corresponden las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 y cuáles tasas usó.  Planilla que no se radicó debido a que no trató como empleado a ningún trabajador.  Si no ha radicado anteriormente un Formulario 941-PR porque trató incorrectamente a todos los trabajadores como si fueran contratistas independientes o trabajadores que no eran empleados, radique un Formulario 941-PR para cada trimestre atrasado. En cada Formulario 941-PR por el cual tiene derecho a usar tasas conforme a la sección 3509 complete los siguientes pasos.  Anote                                \"                                  Misclassified Employees                               \"                             (Empleados clasificados erróneamente) en letra negrilla en la parte superior de la página 1.

Complete la sección donde se firma.         Si no puede usar las tasas conforme a la sección 3509 (por ejemplo, debido a que los trabajadores que usted trató como trabajadores que no son empleados eran, de hecho, empleados estatutarios determinados), radique un Formulario 941-PR por cada trimestre atrasado. Anote \"                   Misclassified Employees                \" (Empleados clasificados erróneamente) en letra negrilla en la parte superior de la página 1 de cada Formulario 941-PR.

Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in instructions on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.   \\xa0 Unresolved Tax Issues If you have attempted to deal with an IRS problem unsuccessfully, you should contact the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS). The Taxpayer Advocate independently represents the estate\\'s or trust\\'s interests and concerns within the IRS by protecting its rights and resolving problems that have not been fixed through normal channels. While Taxpayer Advocates can\\'t change the tax law or make a technical tax decision, they can clear up problems that resulted from previous contacts and ensure that the estate\\'s or trust\\'s case is given a complete and impartial review. The estate\\'s or trust\\'s assigned personal advocate will listen to its point of view and will work with the estate or trust to address its concerns. The estate or trust can expect the advocate to provide:    An impartial and independent look at your problem,   Timely acknowledgment,   The name and phone number of the individual assigned to its case,   Updates on progress,   Timeframes for action,   Speedy resolution, and   Courteous service.    \\xa0 When contacting the Taxpayer Advocate, you should provide the following information.    The estate\\'s or trust\\'s name, address, and employer identification number (EIN).   The name and telephone number of an authorized contact person and the hours he or she can be reached.   The type of tax return and year(s) involved.   A detailed description of the problem.   Previous attempts to solve the problem and the office that had been contacted.   A description of the hardship the estate or trust is facing and supporting documentation (if applicable).    \\xa0 You can contact a Taxpayer Advocate as follows.    Call the Taxpayer Advocate\\'s toll-free number: 877-777-4778.   Call, write, or fax the Taxpayer Advocate office in its area (see Pub. 1546, Taxpayer Advocate Service, Your Voice At The IRS, for addresses and phone numbers).   TTY/TDD help is available by calling 800-829-4059.   Visit the website at IRS.gov/advocate.    \\xa0   \\xa0 How To Get Forms and Publications  \\xa0 Internet. You can access the IRS website 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at IRS.gov to:    Download forms, including talking tax forms, instructions, and publications;   Order IRS products;   Use the online Internal Revenue Code, regulations, and other official guidance;   Research your tax questions;   Search publications by topic or keyword;   Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN); and   Sign up to receive local and national tax news by email.    \\xa0      General Instructions    \\xa0 Purpose of Form The fiduciary of a domestic decedent\\'s estate, trust, or bankruptcy estate uses Form 1041 to report:    The income, deductions, gains, losses, etc. of the estate or trust;   The income that is either accumulated or held for future distribution or distributed currently to the beneficiaries;   Any income tax liability of the estate or trust;   Employment taxes on wages paid to household employees; and   Net Investment Income Tax. See Schedule G, Part I, line 5, and the Instructions for Form 8960.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Income Taxation of Trusts and Decedents\\' Estates A trust or a decedent\\'s estate is a separate legal entity for federal tax purposes. A decedent\\'s estate comes into existence at the time of death of an individual. A trust may be created during an individual\\'s life (inter vivos)  or at the time of his or her death under a will (testamentary).  If the trust instrument contains certain provisions, then the person creating the trust (the grantor) is treated as the owner of the trust\\'s assets. Such a trust is a grantor type trust. See Grantor Type Trusts, later, under Special Reporting Instructions.   A trust or decedent\\'s estate figures its gross income in much the same manner as an individual. Most deductions and credits allowed to individuals are also allowed to estates and trusts. However, there is one major distinction. A trust or decedent\\'s estate is allowed an income distribution deduction  for distributions to beneficiaries. To figure this deduction, the fiduciary must complete Schedule B. The income distribution deduction determines the amount of any distributions taxed to the beneficiaries. For this reason, a trust or decedent\\'s estate sometimes is referred to as a \"pass-through\" entity. The beneficiary, and not the trust or decedent\\'s estate, pays income tax on his or her distributive share of income. Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) is used to notify the beneficiaries of the amounts to be included on their income tax returns. Before preparing Form 1041, the fiduciary must figure the accounting income  of the estate or trust under the will or trust instrument and applicable local law to determine the amount, if any, of income that is required to be distributed, because the income distribution deduction is based, in part, on that amount.   \\xa0 Abusive Trust Arrangements Certain trust arrangements claim to reduce or eliminate federal taxes in ways that are not permitted under the law. Abusive trust arrangements typically are promoted by the promise of tax benefits with no meaningful change in the taxpayer\\'s control over or benefit from the taxpayer\\'s income or assets. The promised benefits may include reduction or elimination of income subject to tax; deductions for personal expenses paid by the trust; depreciation deductions of an owner\\'s personal residence and furnishings; a stepped-up basis for property transferred to the trust; the reduction or elimination of self-employment taxes; and the reduction or elimination of gift and estate taxes. These promised benefits are inconsistent with the tax rules applicable to trust arrangements. Abusive trust arrangements often use trusts to hide the true ownership of assets and income or to disguise the substance of transactions. These arrangements frequently involve more than one trust, each holding different assets of the taxpayer (for example, the taxpayer\\'s business, business equipment, home, automobile, etc.). Some trusts may hold interests in other trusts, purport to involve charities, or are foreign trusts. Funds may flow from one trust to another trust by way of rental agreements, fees for services, purchase agreements, and distributions. Some of the abusive trust arrangements that have been identified include unincorporated business trusts (or organizations), equipment or service trusts, family residence trusts, charitable trusts, and final trusts. In each of these trusts, the original owner of the assets nominally subject to the trust effectively retains the authority to cause financial benefits of the trust to be directly or indirectly returned or made available to the owner. For example, the trustee may be the promoter, a relative, or a friend of the owner who simply carries out the directions of the owner whether or not permitted by the terms of the trust. When trusts are used for legitimate business, family, or estate planning purposes, either the trust, the beneficiary, or the transferor of assets to the trust will pay the tax on income generated by the trust property. Trusts can\\'t be used to transform a taxpayer\\'s personal, living, or educational expenses into deductible items, and can\\'t seek to avoid tax liability by ignoring either the true ownership of income and assets or the true substance of transactions. Therefore, the tax results promised by the promoters of abusive trust arrangements are not allowable under the law, and the participants in and promoters of these arrangements may be subject to civil or criminal penalties in appropriate cases. For more details, including the legal principles that control the proper tax treatment of these abusive trust arrangements, see Notice 97-24, 1997-1 C.B. 409. For additional information about abusive tax arrangements, visit the IRS website at IRS.gov and type \"Abusive Trusts\" in the search box.   \\xa0 Definitions  Adjusted gross income (AGI). Compute the AGI of an estate or non-grantor trust by subtracting the following from total income on line 9 of page 1:    The administration costs of the estate or trust (the total of lines 12, 14, and 15a to the extent they are costs incurred in the administration of the estate or trust) that wouldn\\'t have been incurred if the property were not held by the estate or trust;   The income distribution deduction (line 18);   The amount of the exemption (line 21);   The net operating loss deduction (NOLD) claimed on line 15b.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Electing small business trust (ESBT). Compute the AGI of the S portion of an ESBT in the same manner as an individual taxpayer, except that administration costs allocable to the S portion (to the extent they are costs incurred in the administration of the trust that wouldn\\'t have been incurred if the property were not held by the estate or trust) shall be deducted in arriving at AGI.     Beneficiary.  A beneficiary includes an heir, a legatee, or a devisee.   Decedent\\'s estate.  The decedent\\'s estate is an entity that is formed at the time of an individual\\'s death and generally is charged with gathering the decedent\\'s assets, paying the decedent\\'s debts and expenses, and distributing the remaining assets. Generally, the estate consists of all the property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated, that the decedent owned an interest in at death.   Distributable net income (DNI).  The income distribution deduction allowable to estates and trusts for amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed to beneficiaries is limited to DNI. This amount, which is figured on Schedule B, line 7, is also used to determine how much of an amount paid, credited, or required to be distributed to a beneficiary will be includible in his or her gross income.   Income in respect of a decedent. When completing Form 1041, you must take into account any items that are income in respect of a decedent (IRD). In general, IRD is income that a decedent was entitled to receive but that was not properly includible in the decedent\\'s final income tax return under the decedent\\'s method of accounting. IRD includes:     All accrued income of a decedent who reported his or her income on the cash method of accounting,   Income accrued solely because of the decedent\\'s death in the case of a decedent who reported his or her income on the accrual method of accounting, and   Income to which the decedent had a contingent claim at the time of his or her death.    \\xa0 Some examples of IRD for a decedent who kept his or her books on the cash method are:     Deferred salary payments that are payable to the decedent\\'s estate,   Uncollected interest on U.S. savings bonds,   Proceeds from the completed sale of farm produce, and   The portion of a lump-sum distribution to the beneficiary of a decedent\\'s IRA that equals the balance in the IRA at the time of the owner\\'s death. This includes unrealized appreciation and income accrued to that date, less the aggregate amount of the owner\\'s nondeductible contributions to the IRA. Such amounts are included in the beneficiary\\'s gross income in the tax year that the distribution is received.    \\xa0 The IRD has the same character it would have had if the decedent had lived and received such amount.  \\xa0 Deductions and credits in respect of a decedent. The following deductions and credits, when paid by the decedent\\'s estate, are allowed on Form 1041 even though they were not allowable on the decedent\\'s final income tax return.     Business expenses deductible under section 162.   Interest deductible under section 163.   Taxes deductible under section 164.   Percentage depletion allowed under section 611.   Foreign tax credit.    \\xa0 For more information on IRD, see section 691 andPub. 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators.    Income required to be distributed currently. Income required to be distributed currently is income that is required under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law to be distributed in the year it is received. The fiduciary  must be under a duty to distribute the income currently, even if the actual distribution is not made until after the close of the trust\\'s tax year. See Regulations section 1.651(a)-2.   Fiduciary.  A fiduciary is a trustee of a trust, or an executor, executrix, administrator, administratrix, personal representative, or person in possession of property of a decedent\\'s estate.   Note. Any reference in these instructions to \"you\" means the fiduciary of the estate or trust.   Trust.  A trust is an arrangement created either by a will or by an inter vivos declaration by which trustees take title to property for the purpose of protecting or conserving it for the beneficiaries under the ordinary rules applied in chancery or probate courts.      Revocable living trust.  A revocable living trust is an arrangement created by a written agreement or declaration during the life of an individual and can be changed or ended at any time during the individual\\'s life. A revocable living trust is generally created to manage and distribute property. Many people use this type of trust instead of (or in addition to) a will. Because this type of trust is revocable, it is treated as a grantor type trust for tax purposes. See Grantor Type Trusts under Special Reporting Instructions, later, for special filing instructions that apply to grantor trusts.    \\xa0 Be sure to read Optional Filing Methods for Certain Grantor Type Trusts. Generally, most people that have revocable living trusts will be able to use Optional Method 1. This method is the easiest and least burdensome way to meet your obligations.   \\xa0 Who Must File   \\xa0 Decedent\\'s Estate  The fiduciary (or one of the joint fiduciaries) must file Form 1041 for a domestic estate that has:    Gross income for the tax year of $600 or more, or   A beneficiary who is a nonresident alien.   If you held a qualified investment in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) at any time during the year, you must file your return with Form 8997 attached. See the Form 8997 instructions.    \\xa0 An estate is a domestic estate if it isn\\'t a foreign estate. A foreign estate is one the income of which is from sources outside the United States that isn\\'t effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and isn\\'t includible in gross income. If you are the fiduciary of a foreign estate, file Form 1040NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return, instead of Form 1041.   \\xa0 Trust  The fiduciary (or one of the joint fiduciaries) must file Form 1041 for a domestic trust taxable under section 641 that has:    Any taxable income for the tax year,   Gross income of $600 or more (regardless of taxable income), or   A beneficiary who is a nonresident alien.   If you held a qualified investment in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) at any time during the year, you must file your return with Form 8997 attached. See the Form 8997 instructions.    \\xa0 Two or more trusts are treated as one trust if the trusts have substantially the same grantor(s) and substantially the same primary beneficiary(ies) and a principal purpose of such trusts is avoidance of tax. This provision applies only to that portion of the trust that is attributable to contributions to corpus made after March 1, 1984. A trust is a domestic trust if:    A U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust (court test), and   One or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust (control test).    \\xa0 See Regulations section 301.7701-7 for more information on the court and control tests. Also treated as a domestic trust is a trust (other than a trust treated as wholly owned by the grantor) that:    Was in existence on August 20, 1996,   Was treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, and   Elected to continue to be treated as a domestic trust.    \\xa0 A trust that isn\\'t a domestic trust is treated as a foreign trust. If you are the trustee of a foreign trust, file Form 1040NR instead of Form 1041. Also, a foreign trust with a U.S. owner generally must file Form 3520-A, Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a U.S. Owner. If a domestic trust becomes a foreign trust, it is treated under section 684 as having transferred all of its assets to a foreign trust, except to the extent a grantor or another person is treated as the owner of the trust when the trust becomes a foreign trust.   \\xa0 Grantor Type Trusts  If all or any portion of a trust is a grantor type trust, then that trust or portion of a trust must follow the special reporting requirements discussed later, under Special Reporting Instructions. See Grantor Type Trust under Specific Instructions for more details on what makes a trust a grantor type trust.  Note. A trust may be part grantor trust and part \"other\" type of trust, for example, simple or complex, or electing small business trust (ESBT).   Qualified subchapter S trusts (QSSTs).  QSSTs must follow the special reporting requirements for these trusts discussed later, under Special Reporting Instructions.   \\xa0    Special Rule for Certain Revocable Trusts      Section 645 provides that if both the executor (if any) of an estate (the related estate) and the trustee of a qualified revocable trust (QRT) elect the treatment in section 645, the trust must be treated and taxed as part of the related estate during the election period. This election may be made by a QRT even if no executor is appointed for the related estate. In general, Form 8855, Election To Treat a Qualified Revocable Trust as Part of an Estate, must be filed by the due date for Form 1041 for the first tax year of the related estate. This applies even if the combined related estate and electing trust don\\'t have sufficient income to be required to file Form 1041. However, if the estate is granted an extension of time to file Form 1041 for its first tax year, the due date for Form 8855 is the extended due date. Once made, the election is irrevocable.  Qualified revocable trusts (QRT).  In general, a QRT is any trust (or part of a trust) that, on the day the decedent died, was treated as owned by the decedent because the decedent held the power to revoke the trust as described in section 676. An electing trust is a QRT for which a section 645 election has been made.   Election period. The election period is the period of time during which an electing trust is treated as part of its related estate. The election period begins on the date of the decedent\\'s death and terminates on the earlier of:     The day on which the electing trust and related estate, if any, distribute all of their assets, or   The day before the applicable date.    To determine the applicable date, first determine whether a Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, is required to be filed as a result of the decedent\\'s death. If no Form 706 is required to be filed, the applicable date is 2 years after the date of the decedent\\'s death. If Form 706 is required, the applicable date is the later of 2 years after the date of the decedent\\'s death or 6 months after the final determination of liability for estate tax. For additional information, see Regulations section 1.645-1(f).   Taxpayer identification number (TIN). All QRTs must obtain a new TIN following the death of the decedent whether or not a section 645 election is made. (Use Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, to notify payers of the new TIN.) An electing trust that continues after the termination of the election period doesn\\'t need to obtain a new TIN following the termination unless:     An executor was appointed and agreed to the election after the electing trust made a valid section 645 election, and the electing trust filed a return as an estate under the trust\\'s TIN, or   No executor was appointed and the QRT was the filing trust (as explained later).    \\xa0 A related estate that continues after the termination of the election period doesn\\'t need to obtain a new TIN. For more information about TINs, including trusts with multiple owners, see Regulations sections 1.645-1 and 301.6109-1(a).   General procedures for completing Form 1041 during the election period. \\xa0 If there is an executor.  The following rules apply to filing Form 1041 while the election is in effect.     The executor of the related estate is responsible for filing Form 1041 for the estate and all electing trusts. The return is filed under the name and TIN of the related estate. Be sure to check the Decedent\\'s estate box at the top of Form 1041 and Item G if the estate has made a section 645 election. The executor continues to file Form 1041 during the election period even if the estate distributes all of its assets before the end of the election period.   The Form 1041 includes all items of income, deduction, and credit for the estate and all electing trusts.   For Item G, the executor must provide the TIN of the electing trust with the highest total asset value.   The executor must attach a statement to Form 1041 providing the following information for each electing trust (including the electing trust provided in Item G): (a) the name of the electing trust, (b) the TIN of the electing trust, and (c) the name and address of the trustee of the electing trust.   The related estate and the electing trust are treated as separate shares for purposes of computing DNI and applying distribution provisions. Also, each of those shares can contain two or more separate shares. For more information, see Separate share rule, later, and Regulations section 1.645-1(e)(2)(iii).   The executor is responsible for insuring that the estate\\'s share of the combined tax obligation is paid.    \\xa0 For additional information, including treatment of transfers between shares and charitable contribution deductions, see Regulations section 1.645-1(e). \\xa0  \\xa0  If there isn\\'t an executor. If no executor has been appointed for the related estate, the trustee of the electing trust files Form 1041 as if it was an estate. File using the TIN that the QRT obtained after the death of the decedent. The trustee can choose a fiscal year as the trust\\'s tax year during the election period. Be sure to check the Decedent\\'s estate box at the top of Form 1041 and Item G if the filing trust has made a section 645 election. For Item G, the filing trustee must provide the TIN of the electing trust with the highest total asset value. The electing trust is entitled to a single $600 personal exemption on returns filed for the election period. If there is more than one electing trust, the trusts must appoint one trustee as the filing trustee. Form 1041 is filed under the name and TIN of the filing trustee\\'s trust. A statement providing the same information about the electing trusts (except the filing trust) that is listed under, If there is an executor, above must be attached to these Forms 1041. All electing trusts must choose the same tax year. If there is more than one electing trust, the filing trustee is responsible for ensuring that the filing trust\\'s share of the combined tax liability is paid. For additional information on filing requirements when there is no executor, including application of the separate share rule, see Regulations section 1.645-1(e). For information on the requirements when an executor is appointed after an election is made and the executor doesn\\'t agree to the election, see below.   \\xa0 Responsibilities of the trustee when there is an executor (or there isn\\'t an executor and the trustee isn\\'t the filing trustee). When there is an executor (or there isn\\'t an executor and the trustee isn\\'t the filing trustee), the trustee of an electing trust is responsible for the following during the election period.     To timely provide the executor with all the trust information necessary to allow the executor to file a complete, accurate, and timely Form 1041.   To ensure that the electing trust\\'s share of the combined tax liability is paid.    \\xa0 The trustee does not file a Form 1041 during the election period (except for a final return if the trust terminates during the election period as explained later).    Procedure for completing Form 1041 for the year in which the election terminates. \\xa0 If there is an executor.  If there is an executor, the Form 1041 filed under the name and TIN of the related estate for the tax year in which the election terminates includes (a) the items of income, deduction, and credit for the related estate for its entire tax year, and (b) the income, deductions, and credits for the electing trust for the period that ends with the last day of the election period. If the estate won\\'t continue after the close of the tax year, indicate that this Form 1041 is a final return. At the end of the last day of the election period, the combined entity is deemed to distribute the share comprising the electing trust to a new trust. All items of income, including net capital gains, that are attributable to the share comprising the electing trust are included in the calculation of DNI of the electing trust and treated as distributed. The distribution rules of sections 661 and 662 apply to this deemed distribution. The combined entity is entitled to an income distribution deduction for this deemed distribution, and the \"new\" trust must include its share of the distribution in its income. See Regulations sections 1.645-1(e)(2)(iii) and 1.645-1(h) for more information. If the electing trust continues in existence after the termination of the election period, the trustee must file Form 1041 under the name and TIN of the trust, using the calendar year as its accounting period, if it is otherwise required to file.  \\xa0 If there isn\\'t an executor. If there isn\\'t an executor, the following rules apply to filing Form 1041 for the tax year in which the election period ends.     The tax year of the electing trust closes on the last day of the election period, and the Form 1041 filed for that tax year includes all items of income, deduction, and credit for the electing trust for the period beginning with the first day of the tax year and ending with the last day of the election period.   The deemed distribution rules discussed above apply.   Check the box to indicate that this Form 1041 is a final return.   If the filing trust continues after the termination of the election period, the trustee must obtain a new TIN. If the trust meets the filing requirements, the trustee must file a Form 1041 under the new TIN for the period beginning with the day after the close of the election period and, in general, ending December 31 of that year.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Responsibilities of the trustee when there is an executor (or there isn\\'t an executor and the trustee isn\\'t the filing trustee). In addition to the requirements listed above under this same heading, the trustee is responsible for the following.     If the trust will not continue after the close of the election period, the trustee must file a Form 1041 under the name and TIN of the trust. Complete the entity information and items A, C, D, and F. Indicate in item F that this is a final return. Don\\'t report any items of income, deduction, or credit.   If the trust will continue after the close of the election period, the trustee must file a Form 1041 for the trust for the tax year beginning the day after the close of the election period and, in general, ending December 31 of that year. Use the TIN obtained after the decedent\\'s death. Follow the general rules for completing the return.    \\xa0    Special filing instructions. \\xa0  \\xa0 When the election isn\\'t made by the due date of the QRT\\'s Form 1041. If the section 645 election hasn\\'t been made by the time the QRT\\'s first income tax return would be due for the tax year beginning with the decedent\\'s death, but the trustee and executor (if any) have decided to make a section 645 election, then the QRT isn\\'t required to file a Form 1041 for the short tax year beginning with the decedent\\'s death and ending on December 31 of that year. However, if a valid election isn\\'t subsequently made, the QRT may be subject to penalties and interest for failure to file and failure to pay. If the QRT files a Form 1041 for this short period, and a valid section 645 election is subsequently made, then the trustee must file an amended Form 1041 for the electing trust, excluding all items of income, deduction, and credit of the electing trust. These amounts are then included on the first Form 1041 filed by the executor for the related estate (or the filing trustee for the electing trust filing as an estate).   \\xa0 Later appointed executor. If an executor for the related estate isn\\'t appointed until after the trustee has made a valid section 645 election, the executor must agree to the trustee\\'s election and they must file a revised Form 8855 within 90 days of the appointment of the executor. If the executor doesn\\'t agree to the election, the election terminates as of the date of appointment of the executor. If the executor agrees to the election, the trustee must amend any Form 1041 filed under the name and TIN of the electing trust for the period beginning with the decedent\\'s death. The amended returns are still filed under the name and TIN of the electing trust, and they must include the items of income, deduction, and credit for the related estate for the periods covered by the returns. Also, attach a statement to the amended Forms 1041 identifying the name and TIN of the related estate, and the name and address of the executor. Check the Final return box on the amended return for the tax year that ends with the appointment of the executor. Except for this amended return, all returns filed for the combined entity after the appointment of the executor must be filed under the name and TIN of the related estate. If the election terminates as the result of a later appointed executor, the executor of the related estate must file Forms 1041 under the name and TIN of the related estate for all tax years of the related estate beginning with the decedent\\'s death. The electing trust\\'s election period and tax year terminate the day before the appointment of the executor. The trustee isn\\'t required to amend any of the returns filed by the electing trust for the period prior to the appointment of the executor. The trust must file a final Form 1041 following the instructions above for completing Form 1041 in the year in which the election terminates and there is no executor.   \\xa0 Termination of the trust during the election period. If an electing trust terminates during the election period, the trustee of that trust must file a final Form 1041 by completing the entity information (using the trust\\'s EIN), checking the Final return box, and signing and dating the form. Don\\'t report items of income, deduction, and credit. These items are reported on the related estate\\'s return.      \\xa0 Alaska Native Settlement Trusts  The trustee of an Alaska Native Settlement Trust may elect the special tax treatment for the trust and its beneficiaries provided for in section 646. The election must be made by the due date (including extensions) for filing the trust\\'s tax return for its first tax year ending after June 7, 2001. Don\\'t use Form 1041. Use Form 1041-N, U.S. Income Tax Return for Electing Alaska Native Settlement Trusts, to make the election. Additionally, Form 1041-N is the trust\\'s income tax return and satisfies the section 6039H information reporting requirement for the trust.   \\xa0 Bankruptcy Estate  The bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in- possession must file Form 1041 for the estate of an individual involved in bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the United States Code if the estate has gross income for the tax year of $12,200 or more. See Bankruptcy Estates, later, for details.   \\xa0 Charitable Remainder Trusts A section 664 charitable remainder trust (CRT) doesn’t file Form 1041. Instead, a CRT files Form 5227, Split-Interest Trust Information Return. If the CRT has any unrelated business taxable income, it also must file Form 4720, Return of Certain Excise Taxes Under Chapters 41 and 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.   \\xa0 Common Trust Funds  Don\\'t file Form 1041 for a common trust fund maintained by a bank. Instead, the fund may use Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, for its return. For more details, see section 584 and Regulations section 1.6032-1.   \\xa0 Electing Small Business Trusts Electing small business trusts file Form 1041. However, see Electing Small Business Trusts (ESBTs), later, for a discussion of the special reporting requirements for these trusts.   \\xa0 Pooled Income Funds Pooled income funds file Form 1041. See Pooled Income Funds, later, for the special reporting requirements for these trusts. Additionally, pooled income funds must file Form 5227, Split-Interest Trust Information Return.   \\xa0 Qualified Funeral Trusts Trustees of pre-need funeral trusts who elect treatment under section 685 file Form 1041-QFT, U.S. Income Tax Return for Qualified Funeral Trusts. All other pre-need funeral trusts, see Grantor Type Trusts, later, for Form 1041 reporting requirements.   \\xa0 Qualified Settlement Funds  The trustee of a designated or qualified settlement fund (QSF) generally must file Form 1120-SF, U.S. Income Tax Return for Settlement Funds, instead of Form 1041.  Special election. If a QSF has only one transferor, the transferor may elect to treat the QSF as a grantor type trust. To make the grantor trust election, the transferor must attach an election statement to a timely filed Form 1041, including extensions, that the administrator files for the QSF for the tax year in which the settlement fund is established. If Form 1041 isn\\'t filed because Optional Method 1 or 2 (described later) was chosen, attach the election statement to a timely filed income tax return, including extensions, of the transferor for the tax year in which the settlement fund is established.  \\xa0 Election statement. The election statement may be made separately or, if filed with Form 1041, on the attachment described under Grantor Type Trusts, later. At the top of the election statement, write \"Section 1.468B-1(k) Election\" and include the transferor\\'s:    Name,   Address,   TIN, and   A statement that he or she will treat the qualified settlement fund as a grantor type trust.     \\xa0     \\xa0 Widely Held Fixed Investment Trust (WHFITs) Trustees and middlemen of WHFITs don\\'t file Form 1041. Instead, they report all items of gross income and proceeds on the appropriate Form 1099. For the definition of a WHFIT, see Regulations section 1.671-5(b)(22). A tax information statement that includes the information given to the IRS on Forms 1099, as well as additional information identified in Regulations section 1.671-5(e) must be given to trust interest holders. See the General Instructions for Certain Information Returns for more information.    \\xa0 Electronic Filing  Qualified fiduciaries or transmitters may be able to file Form 1041 and related schedules electronically. To become an e-file provider complete the following steps.    Create an IRS  e-Services account.   Submit your  e-file provider application online.   Pass a  suitability check.    \\xa0 The online application process takes 4-6 weeks to complete.  Note. Existing e-file providers must now use e-Services to make account updates. Help is available online at e-services or through the e-Help Desk at 866-255-0654 (512-416-7750 for international calls), Monday through Friday, 6:30 a.m.- 6:00 p.m. (Central time). Frequently asked questions and On-line Tutorials are available to answer questions or to guide users through the application process.  \\xa0 If you file Form 1041 electronically, you may sign the return electronically by using a personal identification number (PIN). See Form 8879-F, IRS e-file Signature Authorization for Form 1041, for details.  \\xa0 Form 8879-F can only be associated with a single Form 1041. Form 8879-F can\\'t be used with multiple Forms 1041. Form 1041 may also be e-Filed using Form 8453-FE, U.S. Estate or Trust Declaration for an IRS e-file return. For more information about e-filing returns through MeF, see Publication 4164, Modernized e-File (MeF) Guide for Software Developers and Transmitters. If Form 1041 is e-filed and there is a balance due, the fiduciary may authorize an electronic funds withdrawal with the return.  \\xa0 Private Delivery Services You can use certain private delivery services (PDS) designated by the IRS to meet the \"timely mailing as timely filing/paying\" rule for tax returns and payments. Go to  IRS.gov/PDS for the current list of designated services. The PDS can tell you how to get written proof of the mailing date. For the IRS mailing address to use if you’re using PDS, go to  IRS.gov/PDSstreetAddresses.  \\xa0 Private delivery services can\\'t deliver items to P.O. boxes. You must use the U.S. Postal Service to mail any item to an IRS P.O. box address.    \\xa0 When To File  For calendar year estates and trusts, file Form 1041 and Schedule(s) K-1 by April 15, 2020. For fiscal year estates and trusts, file Form 1041 by the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the tax year. For example, an estate that has a tax year that ends on June 30, 2020, must file Form 1041 by October 15, 2020. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, file on the next business day.  \\xa0 Extension of Time To File If more time is needed to file the estate or trust return, use Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns, to apply for an automatic 5½-month extension of time to file.    \\xa0 Period Covered File the 2019 return for calendar year 2019 and fiscal years beginning in 2019 and ending in 2020. If the return is for a fiscal year or a short tax year (less than 12 months), fill in the tax year space at the top of the form. The 2019 Form 1041 may also be used for a tax year beginning in 2020 if:    The estate or trust has a tax year of less than 12 months that begins and ends in 2020, and   The 2020 Form 1041 isn\\'t available by the time the estate or trust is required to file its tax return. However, the estate or trust must show its 2020 tax year on the 2019 Form 1041 and incorporate any tax law changes that are effective for tax years beginning after 2019.    \\xa0   \\xa0    Where To File            \\xa0  For all estates and trusts, including charitable and split-interest trusts (other than Charitable Remainder Trusts).  \\xa0             \\xa0 THEN use this address if you:   IF you are located in ...

Box 409101 \\t\\t\\tOgden, Utah 84409       \\xa0 Who Must Sign  \\xa0 Fiduciary  The fiduciary, or an authorized representative, must sign Form 1041. If there are joint fiduciaries, only one is required to sign the return. A financial institution that submitted estimated tax payments for trusts for which it is the trustee must enter its EIN in the space provided for the EIN of the fiduciary. Don\\'t enter the EIN of the trust. For this purpose, a financial institution is one that maintains a Treasury Tax and Loan (TT&L) account. If you are an attorney or other individual functioning in a fiduciary capacity, leave this space blank. Don\\'t enter your individual social security number (SSN).   \\xa0 Paid Preparer  Generally, anyone who is paid to prepare a tax return must sign the return and fill in the other blanks in the \"Paid Preparer Use Only\" area of the return. The person required to sign the return must:    Complete the required preparer information,   Sign it in the space provided for the preparer\\'s signature (a facsimile signature is acceptable), and   Give you a copy of the return for your records.    \\xa0 If you, as fiduciary, fill in Form 1041, leave the \"Paid Preparer Use Only\" space blank. If someone prepares this return and doesn\\'t charge you, that person should not sign the return.   \\xa0 Paid Preparer Authorization  If the fiduciary wants to allow the IRS to discuss the estate\\'s or trust\\'s 2019 tax return with the paid preparer who signed it, check the \"Yes,\" box in the signature area of the return. This authorization applies only to the individual whose signature appears in the Paid Preparer Use Only area of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return. It doesn\\'t apply to the firm, if any, shown in that section. If the \"Yes,\" box is checked, the fiduciary is authorizing the IRS to call the paid preparer to answer any questions that may arise during the processing of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return. The fiduciary is also authorizing the paid preparer to:    Give the IRS any information that is missing from the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return,   Call the IRS for information about the processing of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return or the status of its refund or payment(s), and   Respond to certain IRS notices that the fiduciary has shared with the preparer about math errors, offsets, and return preparation. The notices won\\'t be sent to the preparer.    \\xa0 The fiduciary isn\\'t authorizing the paid preparer to receive any refund check, bind the estate or trust to anything (including any additional tax liability), or otherwise represent the estate or trust before the IRS. The authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing the estate\\'s or trust\\'s 2020 tax return. If the fiduciary wants to expand the paid preparer\\'s authorization or revoke the authorization before it ends, see Pub. 947, Practice Before the IRS and Power of Attorney.    \\xa0 Accounting Methods Figure taxable income using the method of accounting regularly used in keeping the estate\\'s or trust\\'s books and records. Generally, permissible methods include the cash method, the accrual method, or any other method authorized by the Internal Revenue Code. In all cases, the method used must clearly reflect income. Generally, the estate or trust may change its accounting method (for income as a whole or for any material item) only by getting consent on Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method. For more information, see Pub. 538, Accounting Periods and Methods.   \\xa0 Accounting Periods For a decedent\\'s estate, the moment of death determines the end of the decedent\\'s tax year and the beginning of the estate\\'s tax year. As executor or administrator, you choose the estate\\'s tax period when you file its first income tax return. The estate\\'s first tax year may be any period of 12 months or less that ends on the last day of a month. If you select the last day of any month other than December, you are adopting a fiscal tax year. To change the accounting period of an estate, use Form 1128, Application To Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year. Generally, a trust must adopt a calendar year. The following trusts are exempt from this requirement.    A trust that is exempt from tax under section 501(a).   A charitable trust described in section 4947(a)(1).   A trust that is treated as wholly owned by a grantor under the rules of sections 671 through 679.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Rounding Off to Whole Dollars You may round off cents to whole dollars on the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return and schedules. If you do round to whole dollars, you must round all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the decimal point. There is no cents column on the form.   \\xa0 Estimated Tax  Generally, an estate or trust must pay estimated income tax for 2020 if it expects to owe, after subtracting any withholding and credits, at least $1,000 in tax, and it expects the withholding and credits to be less than the smaller of:    90% of the tax shown on the 2020 tax return, or   100% of the tax shown on the 2019 tax return (110% of that amount if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s adjusted gross income on that return is more than $150,000, and less than 2/3 of gross income for 2019 or 2020 is from farming or fishing).    \\xa0 However, if a return was not filed for 2019 or that return didn\\'t cover a full 12 months, item 2 doesn\\'t apply. For this purpose, include household employment taxes in the tax shown on the tax return, but only if either of the following is true:    The estate or trust will have federal income tax withheld for 2020 (see the instructions for Schedule G, Part II, line 14), or   The estate or trust would be required to make estimated tax payments for 2020 even if it didn\\'t include household employment taxes when figuring estimated tax.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Exceptions Estimated tax payments aren\\'t required from:    An estate of a domestic decedent or a domestic trust that had no tax liability for the full 12-month 2019 tax year;   A decedent\\'s estate for any tax year ending before the date that is 2 years after the decedent\\'s death; or   A trust that was treated as owned by the decedent if the trust will receive the residue of the decedent\\'s estate under the will (or if no will is admitted to probate, the trust primarily responsible for paying debts, taxes, and expenses of administration) for any tax year ending before the date that is 2 years after the decedent\\'s death.    \\xa0 For more information, see Form 1041-ES, Estimated Income Tax for Estates and Trusts.   \\xa0 Electronic Deposits  A financial institution that has been designated as an authorized federal tax depository, and acts as a fiduciary for at least 200 taxable trusts that are required to pay estimated tax, is required to deposit the estimated tax payments electronically using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). A fiduciary that isn\\'t required to make electronic deposits of estimated tax on behalf of a trust or an estate may voluntarily participate in EFTPS. To enroll in or get more information about EFTPS, visit the EFTPS website at eftps.gov or call 1-800-555-4477. Also, see Pub. 966, Electronic Federal Tax Payment System: A Guide to Getting Started.  Depositing on time. For a deposit using EFTPS to be on time, the deposit must be submitted by 8:00 p.m. Eastern time the day before the due date of the deposit.    \\xa0 Section 643(g) Election  Fiduciaries of trusts that pay estimated tax may elect under section 643(g) to have any portion of their estimated tax payments allocated to any of the beneficiaries. The fiduciary of a decedent\\'s estate may make a section 643(g) election only for the final year of the estate. Make the election by filing Form 1041-T, Allocation of Estimated Tax Payments to Beneficiaries, by the 65th day after the close of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax year. Then, include that amount on Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 13, code A, for any beneficiaries for whom it was elected. If Form 1041-T was timely filed, the payments are treated as paid or credited to the beneficiary on the last day of the tax year and must be included as an other amount paid, credited, or required to be distributed on Form 1041, Schedule B, line 10. See the instructions for Schedule B, line 10, later. Failure to make a timely election will result in the estimated tax payments not being transferred to the beneficiary(ies) even if you entered the amount on Schedule K-1. See the instructions for line Schedule G, Part II, line 11 for more details.    \\xa0 Interest and Penalties  \\xa0 Interest Interest is charged on taxes not paid by the due date, even if an extension of time to file is granted. Interest is also charged on penalties imposed for failure to file, negligence, fraud, substantial valuation misstatements, substantial understatements of tax, and reportable transaction understatements. Interest is charged on the penalty from the due date of the return (including extensions). The interest charge is figured at a rate determined under section 6621.   \\xa0 Late Filing of Return  The law provides a penalty of 5% of the tax due for each month, or part of a month, for which a return isn\\'t filed up to a maximum of 25% of the tax due (15% for each month, or part of a month, up to a maximum of 75% if the failure to file is fraudulent). If the return is more than 60 days late, the minimum penalty is the smaller of $435 or the tax due. The penalty won\\'t be imposed if you can show that the failure to file on time was due to reasonable cause. If you receive a notice about penalty and interest after you file this return, send us an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don\\'t attach an explanation when you file Form 1041.   \\xa0 Late Payment of Tax  Generally, the penalty for not paying tax when due is ½ of 1% of the unpaid amount for each month or part of a month it remains unpaid. The maximum penalty is 25% of the unpaid amount. The penalty applies to any unpaid tax on the return. Any penalty is in addition to interest charges on late payments.  \\xa0 If you include interest on either of these penalties with your payment, identify and enter these amounts in the bottom margin of Form 1041, page 1. Don\\'t include the interest or penalty amount in the balance of tax due on line 28.   \\xa0 Failure To Provide Information Timely  You must provide Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), on or before the day you are required to file Form 1041, to each beneficiary who receives a distribution of property or an allocation of an item of the estate. For each failure to provide Schedule K-1 to a beneficiary when due and each failure to include on Schedule K-1 all the information required to be shown (or the inclusion of incorrect information), a $270 penalty may be imposed with regard to each Schedule K-1 for which a failure occurs. The maximum penalty is $3,339,000 for all such failures during a calendar year. If the requirement to report information is intentionally disregarded, each $270 penalty is increased to $550 or, if greater, 10% of the aggregate amount of items required to be reported, and the $3,339,000 maximum doesn\\'t apply. The penalty won\\'t be imposed if the fiduciary can show that not providing information timely was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.   \\xa0 Underpaid Estimated Tax  If the fiduciary underpaid estimated tax, use Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, to figure any penalty. Enter the amount of any penalty on Form 1041, line 27.   \\xa0 Trust Fund Recovery Penalty  This penalty may apply if certain excise, income, social security, and Medicare taxes that must be collected or withheld aren\\'t collected or withheld, or these taxes aren\\'t paid. These taxes are generally reported on Forms 720, 941, 943, 944, or 945. The trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to have been responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. The penalty is equal to the unpaid trust fund tax. See the Instructions for Form 720, Pub. 15 (Circular E), Employer\\'s Tax Guide, or Pub. 51 (Circular A), Agricultural Employer\\'s Tax Guide, for more details, including the definition of responsible persons.   \\xa0 Other Penalties  Other penalties can be imposed for negligence, substantial understatement of tax, and fraud. See Pub. 17, Your Federal Income Tax, for details on these penalties.    \\xa0 Other Forms That May Be Required Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, and Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements.

Use the same size and format as on the printed forms. But show the totals on the printed forms. Attach these separate sheets after all the schedules and forms. Enter the estate\\'s or trust\\'s EIN on each sheet. Don\\'t file a copy of the decedent\\'s will or the trust instrument unless the IRS requests it.    \\xa0 Special Reporting Instructions Grantor type trusts, the S portion of electing small business trusts (ESBTs), and bankruptcy estates all have reporting requirements that are significantly different than other Subchapter J trusts and decedent\\'s estates. Additionally, grantor type trusts have optional filing methods available. Pooled income funds have many similar reporting requirements that other Subchapter J trusts (other than grantor type trusts and electing small business trusts) have but there are some very important differences. These reporting differences and optional filing methods are discussed below by entity.  \\xa0 Grantor Type Trusts  A trust is a grantor trust if the grantor retains certain powers or ownership benefits. This can also apply to only a portion of a trust. See Grantor Type Trust, later, for details on what makes a trust a grantor trust. In general, a grantor trust is ignored for income tax purposes and all of the income, deductions, etc., are treated as belonging directly to the grantor. This also applies to any portion of a trust that is treated as a grantor trust.  Note. If only a portion of the trust is a grantor type trust, indicate both grantor trust and the other type of trust, for example, simple or complex trust, as the type of entities checked in Section A on page 1 of Form 1041.   \\xa0 The following instructions apply only to grantor type trusts that are not using an optional filing method.  How to report. If the entire trust is a grantor trust, fill in only the entity information of Form 1041. Don\\'t show any dollar amounts on the form itself; show dollar amounts only on an attachment to the form. Don\\'t use Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) as the attachment. If only part of the trust is a grantor type trust, the portion of the income, deductions, etc., that is allocable to the non-grantor part of the trust is reported on Form 1041, under normal reporting rules. The amounts that are allocable directly to the grantor are shown only on an attachment to the form. Don\\'t use Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) as the attachment. However, Schedule K-1 is used to reflect any income distributed from the portion of the trust that isn\\'t taxable directly to the grantor or owner. The fiduciary must give the grantor (owner) of the trust a copy of the attachment.  \\xa0 Attachment. On the attachment, show:     The name, identifying number, and address of the person(s) to whom the income is taxable;   The income of the trust that is taxable to the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 678. Report the income in the same detail as it would be reported on the grantor\\'s return had it been received directly by the grantor; and   Any deductions or credits that apply to this income. Report these deductions and credits in the same detail as they would be reported on the grantor\\'s return had they been received directly by the grantor.    \\xa0 The income taxable to the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 678 and the deductions and credits that apply to that income must be reported by that person on their own income tax return.    Example. The John Doe Trust is a grantor type trust. During the year, the trust sold 100 shares of ABC stock for $1,010 in which it had a basis of $10 and 200 shares of XYZ stock for $10 in which it had a $1,020 basis. The trust doesn\\'t report these transactions on Form 1041. Instead, a schedule is attached to the Form 1041 showing each stock transaction separately and in the same detail as John Doe (grantor and owner) will need to report these transactions on his Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets and Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). The trust doesn\\'t net the capital gains and losses, nor does it issue John Doe a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) showing a $10 long-term capital loss.   QSSTs.  Income allocated to S corporation stock held by the trust is treated as owned by the income beneficiary of the portion of the trust that owns the stock. Report this income following the rules discussed above for grantor type trusts. A QSST can\\'t elect any of the optional filing methods discussed below.   However, the trust, and not the income beneficiary, is treated as the owner of the S corporation stock for figuring and attributing the tax results of a disposition of the stock. For example, if the disposition is a sale, the QSST election ends as to the stock sold and any gain or loss recognized on the sale will be that of the trust. For more information on QSSTs, see Regulations section 1.1361-1(j).   \\xa0    Optional Filing Methods for Certain Grantor Type Trusts     Generally, if a trust is treated as owned by one grantor or other person, the trustee may choose Optional Method 1 or Optional Method 2 as the trust\\'s method of reporting instead of filing Form 1041. A husband and wife will be treated as one grantor for purposes of these two optional methods if:    All of the trust is treated as owned by the husband and wife, and   The husband and wife file their income tax return jointly for that tax year.    \\xa0 Generally, if a trust is treated as owned by two or more grantors or other persons, the trustee may choose Optional Method 3 as the trust\\'s method of reporting instead of filing Form 1041. Once you choose the trust\\'s filing method, you must follow the rules under Changing filing methods if you want to change to another method.  Exceptions. The following trusts can\\'t report using the optional filing methods.     A common trust fund (as defined in section 584(a)).   A foreign trust or a trust that has any of its assets located outside the United States.   A qualified subchapter S trust (as defined in section 1361(d)(3)).    A trust all of which is treated as owned by one grantor or one other person whose tax year is other than a calendar year.   A trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons, one of which isn\\'t a U.S. person.   A trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons if at least one grantor or other person is an exempt recipient for information reporting purposes, unless at least one grantor or other person isn\\'t an exempt recipient and the trustee reports without treating any of the grantors or other persons as exempt recipients.    \\xa0   Optional Method 1. For a trust treated as owned by one grantor or by one other person, the trustee must give all payers of income during the tax year the name and TIN of the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust and the address of the trust. This method may be used only if the owner of the trust provides the trustee with a signed Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification. In addition, unless the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust is the trustee or a co-trustee of the trust, the trustee must give the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that:     Shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust;   Identifies the payer of each item of income;   Explains how the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when figuring the grantor\\'s or other person\\'s taxable income or tax; and   Informs the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on his or her income tax return.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Grantor trusts that haven\\'t applied for an EIN and are going to file under Optional Method 1 don\\'t need an EIN for the trust as long as they continue to report under that method.   Optional Method 2. For a trust treated as owned by one grantor or by one other person, the trustee must give all payers of income during the tax year the name, address, and TIN of the trust. The trustee also must file with the IRS the appropriate Forms 1099 to report the income or gross proceeds paid to the trust during the tax year that shows the trust as the payer and the grantor, or other person treated as owner, as the payee. The trustee must report each type of income in the aggregate and each item of gross proceeds separately. The due date for any Forms 1099 required to be filed with the IRS by a trustee under this method is February 28, 2020 (March 31, 2020, if filed electronically). In addition, unless the grantor, or other person treated as owner of the trust, is the trustee or a co-trustee of the trust, the trustee must give the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that:     Shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust;   Explains how the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when figuring the grantor\\'s or other person\\'s taxable income or tax; and   Informs the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on his or her income tax return. This statement satisfies the requirement to give the recipient copies of the Forms 1099 filed by the trustee.    \\xa0   Optional Method 3. For a trust treated as owned by two or more grantors or other persons, the trustee must give all payers of income during the tax year the name, address, and TIN of the trust. The trustee also must file with the IRS the appropriate Forms 1099 to report the income or gross proceeds paid to the trust by all payers during the tax year attributable to the part of the trust treated as owned by each grantor, or other person, showing the trust as the payer and each grantor, or other person treated as owner of the trust, as the payee. The trustee must report each type of income in the aggregate and each item of gross proceeds separately. The due date for any Forms 1099 required to be filed with the IRS by a trustee under this method is February 28, 2020 (March 31, 2020, if filed electronically). In addition, the trustee must give each grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that:     Shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust attributable to the part of the trust treated as owned by the grantor or other person;   Explains how the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when figuring the grantor\\'s or other person\\'s taxable income or tax; and   Informs the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on his or her income tax return. This statement satisfies the requirement to give the recipient copies of the Forms 1099 filed by the trustee.    \\xa0   Changing filing methods. A trustee who previously had filed Form 1041 can change to one of the optional methods by filing a final Form 1041 for the tax year that immediately precedes the first tax year for which the trustee elects to report under one of the optional methods. On the front of the final Form 1041, the trustee must write \"Pursuant to section 1.671-4(g), this is the final Form 1041 for this grantor trust,\" and check the Final return box in item F. For more details on changing reporting methods, including changes from one optional method to another, see Regulations section 1.671-4(g).   Backup withholding.  The following grantor trusts are treated as payors for purposes of backup withholding.       A trust established after 1995, all of which is owned by two or more grantors (treating spouses filing a joint return as one grantor).   A trust with 10 or more grantors established after 1983 but before 1996.      \\xa0   The trustee must withhold a certain percentage of reportable payments made to any grantor who is subject to backup withholding.   For more information, see section 3406 and its regulations.     \\xa0 Pooled Income Funds  If you are filing for a pooled income fund, attach a statement to support the following:    The calculation of the yearly rate of return,   The computation of the deduction for distributions to the beneficiaries, and   The computation of any charitable deduction.    See section 642 and the regulations thereunder for more information. You don\\'t have to complete Schedules A or B of Form 1041. Also, you must file Form 5227, Split-Interest Trust Information Return, for the pooled income fund. However, if all amounts were transferred in trust before May 27, 1969, or if an amount was transferred to the trust after May 26, 1969, for which no deduction was allowed under any of the sections listed under section 4947(a)(2), then Form 5227 does not have to be filed.  Note. Form 1041-A is no longer filed by pooled income funds.    \\xa0 Electing Small Business Trusts (ESBTs)  Special rules apply when figuring the tax on the S portion of an ESBT.  The S portion of an ESBT is the portion of the trust that consists of stock in one or more S corporations and isn\\'t treated as a grantor type trust. The tax on the S portion:    Must be figured separately from the tax on the remainder of the ESBT (if any) and attached to the return, and   Is entered on Schedule G, Part I, line 4.    \\xa0 The tax on the remainder (non-S portion) of the ESBT is figured in the normal manner on Form 1041.  Tax computation attachment. Attach to the return the tax computation for the S portion of the ESBT.  If you need to complete and attach a tax form or worksheet for the S portion of the trust, write \"ESBT\" in the top margin of the tax form, worksheet, or attachment. To compute the tax on the S portion:     Treat that portion of the ESBT as if it were a separate trust;    Include only the income, losses, deductions, and credits allocated to the ESBT as an S corporation shareholder and gain or loss from the disposition of S corporation stock;   Aggregate items of income, losses, deductions, and credits allocated to the ESBT as an S corporation shareholder if the S portion of the ESBT has stock in more than one S corporation;   Deduct state and local income taxes directly related to the S portion or allocated to the S portion if the allocation is reasonable in light of all the circumstances and administrative expenses that wouldn\\'t have been incurred if the S corporation shares were not held by the trust;   Deduct interest expense paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to acquire stock in an S corporation;   Deduct charitable contributions attributable to the S portion. See Pub. 526 to figure the amount of the deduction if either of the following apply.    Cash contributions or contributions of ordinary income property are more than 30% of the AGI of the S portion.   Gifts of capital gain property are more than 20% of the AGI of the S portion.      Don\\'t claim a deduction for capital losses in excess of capital gains;   Don\\'t claim an income distribution deduction or an exemption amount;   Don\\'t claim an exemption amount in figuring the AMT; and   Don\\'t use the tax rate schedule to figure the tax. The tax is 37% of the S portion\\'s taxable income except in figuring the maximum tax on qualified dividends and capital gains.     \\xa0 For additional information, see Regulations section 1.641(c)-1.   Other information. When figuring the tax and DNI on the remaining (non-S) portion of the trust, disregard the S corporation items. Don\\'t apportion to the beneficiaries any of the S corporation items. If the ESBT consists entirely of stock in one or more S corporations, don\\'t make any entries on lines 1–23 of page 1. Instead:     Complete the entity portion;   Follow the instructions above for figuring the tax on the S corporation items;    Enter the ESBT tax on Schedule G, Part I, line 4;   Carry the Total tax from line 9 of Schedule G, Part I, to line 24 on page 1; and   Complete the rest of the return.    \\xa0 The grantor portion (if any) of an ESBT will follow the rules discussed under Grantor Type Trusts, earlier.    \\xa0 Bankruptcy Estates  The bankruptcy estate that is created when an individual debtor files a petition under either chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code is treated as a separate taxable entity. The bankruptcy estate is administered by a trustee or a debtor-in-possession. If the case is later dismissed by the bankruptcy court, the individual debtor is treated as if the bankruptcy petition had never been filed. A separate taxable entity isn\\'t created if a partnership or corporation files a petition under any chapter of title 11 of the U.S. Code. For additional information about bankruptcy estates, see Pub. 908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide.   \\xa0 Who Must File Every trustee (or debtor-in-possession) for an individual\\'s bankruptcy estate under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code must file a return if the bankruptcy estate has gross income of $12,200 or more for tax years beginning in 2019. Failure to do so may result in an estimated Request for Administrative Expenses being filed by the IRS in the bankruptcy proceeding or a motion to compel filing of the return.  \\xa0 The filing of a tax return for the bankruptcy estate doesn\\'t relieve the individual debtor(s) of his, her, or their individual tax obligations.   \\xa0 EIN Every bankruptcy estate of an individual required to file a return must have its own EIN. The SSN of the individual debtor can\\'t be used as the EIN for the bankruptcy estate.  \\xa0    Accounting Period    A bankruptcy estate is allowed to have a fiscal year. However, this period can\\'t be longer than 12 months.   \\xa0    When To File    File Form 1041 on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the tax year. Use Form 7004 to apply for an automatic 6-month extension of time to file.   \\xa0    Disclosure of Return Information    Under section 6103(e)(5), tax returns of individual debtors who have filed for bankruptcy under chapters 7 or 11 of title 11 are, upon written request, open to inspection by or disclosure to the trustee. The returns subject to disclosure to the trustee are those for the year the bankruptcy begins and prior years. Use Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return, to request copies of the individual debtor\\'s tax returns. If the bankruptcy case wasn\\'t voluntary, disclosure can\\'t be made before the bankruptcy court has entered an order for relief, unless the court rules that the disclosure is needed for determining whether relief should be ordered.   \\xa0    Transfer of Tax Attributes From the Individual Debtor to the Bankruptcy Estate    The bankruptcy estate succeeds to the following tax attributes of the individual debtor:    Net operating loss (NOL) \\tcarryovers;   Charitable contribution \\tcarryovers;   Recovery of tax benefit items;   Credit carryovers;   Capital loss carryovers;   Basis, holding period, and \\tcharacter of assets;   Method of accounting;   Unused passive activity losses;   Unused passive activity credits; \\tand   Unused section 465 losses.    \\xa0   \\xa0    Income, Deductions, and Credits    Under section 1398(c), the taxable income of the bankruptcy estate generally is figured in the same manner as that of an individual. The gross income of the bankruptcy estate includes any income included in property of the estate as defined in U.S. Code, title 11, sections 541 and 1115. Under section 1115 of title 11, property of the bankruptcy estate includes (a) earnings from services performed by the debtor after the beginning of the case (both wages and self-employment income) and before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under a different chapter and (b) property described in section 541 of title 11 and income earned therefrom that the debtor acquires after the beginning of the case and before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted. If section 1115 of title 11 applies, the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income includes, as described above, (a) the debtor\\'s earnings from services performed after the beginning of the case and (b) the income from property acquired after the beginning of the case. The income from property owned by the debtor when the case began is also included in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income. However, if this property is exempted from the bankruptcy estate or is abandoned by the trustee or debtor-in-possession, the income from the property isn\\'t included in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income. Also included in income is gain from the sale of the bankruptcy estate\\'s property. To figure gain, the trustee or debtor-in-possession must determine the correct basis of the property. To determine whether any amount paid or incurred by the bankruptcy estate is allowable as a deduction or credit, or is treated as wages for employment tax purposes, treat the amount as if it were paid or incurred by the individual debtor in the same trade or business or other activity the debtor engaged in before the bankruptcy proceedings began.  Administrative expenses. The bankruptcy estate is allowed a deduction for any administrative expense allowed under section 503 of title 11 of the U.S. Code, and any fee or charge assessed under chapter 123 of title 28 of the U.S. Code, to the extent not disallowed under an Internal Revenue Code provision (for example, section 263, 265, or 275).   Administrative expense loss. When figuring an NOL, nonbusiness deductions (including administrative expenses) are limited under section 172(d)(4) to the bankruptcy estate\\'s nonbusiness income. The excess nonbusiness deductions are an administrative expense loss that may be carried back to each of the 3 preceding tax years and forward to each of the 7 succeeding tax years of the bankruptcy estate. The amount of an administrative expense loss that may be carried to any tax year is determined after the NOL deductions allowed for that year. An administrative expense loss is allowed only to the bankruptcy estate and can\\'t be carried to any tax year of the individual debtor.   Carryback of NOLs and credits. \\xa0  \\xa0 For tax years ending after 2017, only NOLs generated from certain farming losses can be carried back. See Pubs. 536 and 225 for more information. If the bankruptcy estate itself incurs an NOL (apart from losses carried forward to the estate from the individual debtor), it can carry back its NOLs not only to previous tax years of the bankruptcy estate, but also to tax years of the individual debtor prior to the year in which the bankruptcy proceedings began. Excess credits, such as the foreign tax credit, also may be carried back to pre-bankruptcy years of the individual debtor.   Standard deduction. A bankruptcy estate that doesn\\'t itemize deductions is allowed a standard deduction of $12,200 for tax year 2019.    Discharge of indebtedness. In a title 11 case, gross income doesn\\'t include amounts that normally would be included in gross income resulting from the discharge of indebtedness. However, any amounts excluded from gross income must be applied to reduce certain tax attributes in a certain order. Attach Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness (and Section 1082 Basis Adjustment), to show the reduction of tax attributes.    \\xa0    Tax Rate Schedule    Figure the tax for the bankruptcy estate using the tax rate schedule below. Enter the tax on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 12a.           If taxable income is:   Over— But not over— The tax is: Of the amount over—   $0 $9,700 10% $0   9,700 39,475 $970.00 + 12% 9,700   39,475 84,200 4,543.00 + 22% 39,475   84,200 160,725 14,382.50 + 24% 84,200   160,725 204,100 32,748.50 + 32% 160,725   204,100 306,175 46,628.50 + 35% 204,100   306,175 ...... 82,354.75 + 37% 306,175     \\xa0   \\xa0    Prompt Determination of Tax Liability    To request a prompt determination of the tax liability of the bankruptcy estate, the trustee or debtor-in-possession must file a written request for the determination with the IRS. The request must be submitted in duplicate and executed under penalties of perjury. The request must include a statement indicating that it is a request for prompt determination of tax liability and: (a) the return type, and all the tax periods for which prompt determination is sought; (b) the name and location of the office where the return was filed; (c) the debtor\\'s name; (d) the debtor\\'s SSN, TIN, or EIN; (e) the type of bankruptcy estate; (f) the bankruptcy case number; and (g) the court where the bankruptcy is pending. Send the request to the Centralized Insolvency Operation, P.O. Box 7346, Philadelphia, PA 19101-7346 (marked \"Request for Prompt Determination\"). The IRS will notify the trustee or debtor-in-possession within 60 days from receipt of the request if the return filed by the trustee or debtor-in-possession has been selected for examination or has been accepted as filed. If the return is selected for examination, it will be examined as soon as possible. The IRS will notify the trustee or debtor-in-possession of any tax due within 180 days from receipt of the request or within any additional time permitted by the bankruptcy court. See Rev. Proc. 2006-24, 2006-22 I.R.B. 943, available at IRS.gov/irb/2006-22_IRB/ar12.html, modified by Announcement 2011–77, available at IRS.gov/irb/2011-51_IRB/ar13.   \\xa0    Special Filing Instructions for Bankruptcy Estates     Use Form 1041 only as a transmittal for Form 1040 or 1040-SR. In the top margin of Form 1040 or 1040-SR write \"Attachment to Form 1041. DO NOT DETACH.\" Attach Form 1040 or 1040-SR to Form 1041. Complete only the identification area at the top of Form 1041. Enter the name of the individual debtor in the following format: \"John Q. Public Bankruptcy Estate.\" Beneath, enter the name of the trustee in the following format: \"Avery Snow, Trustee.\" In item D, enter the date the petition was filed or the date of conversion to a chapter 7 or 11 case. Enter on Form 1041, line 24, the total tax from line 16 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Complete lines 25 through 30 of Form 1041, and sign and date it. In a chapter 11 case filed after October 16, 2005, the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income may be affected by section 1115 of title 11 of the U.S. Code. See Income, Deductions, and Credits earlier. The debtor may receive a Form W-2, 1099-INT, 1099-DIV, or 1099-MISC or other information return reporting wages or other income to the debtor for the entire year, even though some or all of this income is includible in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income under section 1115 of title 11 of the U.S. Code. If this happens, the income reported to the debtor on the Form W-2 or 1099, or other information return (and the withheld income tax shown on these forms) must be reasonably allocated between the debtor and the bankruptcy estate. The debtor-in-possession (or the chapter 11 trustee, if one was appointed) must attach a schedule that shows (a) all the income reported on the Form W-2, Form 1099, or other information return, (b) the portion of this income includible in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income, and (c) all the withheld income tax, if any, and the portion of withheld tax reasonably allocated to the bankruptcy estate. Also, the debtor-in-possesion (or the chapter 11 trustee, if one was appointed) must attach a copy of the Form W-2, if any, issued to the debtor for the tax year if the Form W-2 reports wages to the debtor and some or all of the wages are includible in the bankruptcy estate\\'s gross income because of section 1115 of title 11 of the U.S. Code. For more details, including acceptable allocation methods, see Notice 2006-83, 2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at IRS.gov/irb/2006-40_IRB/ar12.html.        Specific Instructions    \\xa0 Name of Estate or Trust Copy the exact name of the estate or trust from the Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, that you used to apply for the EIN. If the name of the trust was changed during the tax year for which you are filing, enter the trust\\'s new name and check the Change in trust\\'s name box in item F. If a grantor type trust (discussed later), write the name, identification number, and address of the grantor(s) or other owner(s) in parentheses after the name of the trust.   \\xa0 Name and Title of Fiduciary Enter the name and title of the fiduciary. If the name entered is different than the name on the prior year\\'s return, see Change in Fiduciary\\'s Name and Change in Fiduciary, later.   \\xa0 Address Include the suite, room, or other unit number after the street address. If the post office doesn\\'t deliver mail to the street address and the fiduciary has a P.O. box, show the box number instead. If you want a third party (such as an accountant or an attorney) to receive mail for the estate or trust, enter on the street address line \"C/O\" followed by the third party\\'s name and street address or P.O. box. If the estate or trust has had a change of address (including a change to an \"in care of\" name and address) and did not file Form 8822-B, Change of Address or Responsible Party — Business, check the Change in fiduciary\\'s address box in item F. If the estate or trust has a change of mailing address (including a new \"in care of\" name and address) or responsible party after filing its return, file Form 8822-B to notify the IRS of the change.   \\xa0 A. Type of Entity Check the appropriate box(es) that describes the entity for which you are filing the return. In some cases, more than one box is checked. Check all boxes that apply to your trust. For example, if only a portion of a trust is a grantor type trust or if only a portion of an electing small business trust is the S portion, then more than one box is checked.  Note. Determination of entity status is made on an annual basis.   \\xa0 There are special reporting requirements for grantor type trusts, pooled income funds, electing small business trusts, and bankruptcy estates. See Special Reporting Instructions, earlier.  \\xa0 Decedent\\'s Estate  An estate of a deceased person is a taxable entity separate from the decedent. It generally continues to exist until the final distribution of the assets of the estate is made to the heirs and other beneficiaries. The income earned from the property of the estate during the period of administration or settlement must be accounted for and reported by the estate.   \\xa0 Simple Trust  A trust may qualify as a simple trust if:    The trust instrument requires that all income must be distributed currently;   The trust instrument doesn\\'t provide that any amounts are to be paid, permanently set aside, or used for charitable purposes; and   The trust doesn\\'t distribute amounts allocated to the corpus of the trust.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Complex Trust  A complex trust is any trust that doesn\\'t qualify as a simple trust as explained above.   \\xa0 Qualified Disability Trust A qualified disability trust is any nongrantor trust:    Described in 42 U.S.C. 1396p(c)(2)(B)(iv) and established solely for the benefit of an individual under 65 years of age who is disabled, and   All the beneficiaries of which are determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to have been disabled for some part of the tax year within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3).    \\xa0 A trust will not fail to meet item 2 above just because the trust\\'s corpus may revert to a person who isn\\'t disabled after the trust ceases to have any disabled beneficiaries.   \\xa0 ESBT (S Portion Only)  The S portion of an ESBT is the portion of the trust that consists of S corporation stock and that isn\\'t treated as owned by the grantor or another person. See Electing Small Business Trusts (ESBTs), earlier, for more information about an ESBT.   \\xa0 Grantor Type Trust  A grantor type trust is a legal trust under applicable state law that isn\\'t recognized as a separate taxable entity for income tax purposes because the grantor or other substantial owners have not relinquished complete dominion and control over the trust. Generally, for transfers made in trust after March 1, 1986, the grantor is treated as the owner of any portion of a trust in which he or she has a reversionary interest in either the income or corpus therefrom, if, as of the inception of that portion of the trust, the value of the reversionary interest is more than 5% of the value of that portion. Also, the grantor is treated as holding any power or interest that was held by either the grantor\\'s spouse at the time that the power or interest was created or who became the grantor\\'s spouse after the creation of that power or interest. See Grantor Type Trusts, earlier, for more information.  Pre-need funeral trusts.  The purchasers of pre-need funeral services are the grantors and the owners of pre-need funeral trusts established under state laws. See Rev. Rul. 87-127, 1987-2 C.B. 156. However, the trustees of pre-need funeral trusts can elect to file the return and pay the tax for qualified funeral trusts. For more information, see Form 1041-QFT, U.S. Income Tax Return for Qualified Funeral Trusts.   Nonqualified deferred compensation plans.  Taxpayers may adopt and maintain grantor trusts in connection with nonqualified deferred compensation plans (sometimes referred to as \"rabbi trusts\"). Rev. Proc. 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, provides a \"model grantor trust\" for use in rabbi trust arrangements. The procedure also provides guidance for requesting rulings on the plans that use these trusts.   QSSTs.  The beneficiary of a qualified subchapter S trust is treated as the substantial owner of that portion of the trust which consists of stock in an S corporation for which an election under section 1361(d)(2) has been made. See QSSTs, earlier.    \\xa0 Bankruptcy Estate  A chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy estate is a separate and distinct taxable entity from the individual debtor for federal income tax purposes. See Bankruptcy Estates, earlier. For more information, see section 1398 and Pub. 908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide.   \\xa0 Pooled Income Fund  A pooled income fund is a split-interest trust with a remainder interest for a public charity and a life income interest retained by the donor or for another person. The property is held in a pool with other pooled income fund property and doesn\\'t include any tax-exempt securities. The income for a retained life interest is figured using the yearly rate of return earned by the trust. See section 642(c) and the related regulations for more information.    \\xa0 B. Number of Schedules K-1 Attached Every trust or decedent\\'s estate claiming an income distribution deduction on page 1, line 18, must enter the number of Schedules K-1 (Form 1041) that are attached to Form 1041.   \\xa0 C. Employer Identification Number Every estate or trust that is required to file Form 1041 must have an EIN. An EIN may be applied for:    Online at IRS.gov/EIN. The EIN is issued immediately once the application information is validated.   By mailing or faxing Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number.    \\xa0 If the estate or trust hasn\\'t received its EIN by the time the return is due, write \"Applied for\" and the date you applied in the space for the EIN. For more details, see Pub. 583, Starting a Business and Keeping Records.   \\xa0 D. Date Entity Created Enter the date the trust was created, or, if a decedent\\'s estate, the date of the decedent\\'s death.   \\xa0 E. Nonexempt Charitable and Split-Interest Trusts  \\xa0 Section 4947(a)(1) Trust  Check this box if the trust is a nonexempt charitable trust within the meaning of section 4947(a)(1). A nonexempt charitable trust is a trust:    That isn\\'t exempt from tax under section 501(a);   In which all of the unexpired interests are devoted to one or more charitable purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B); and   For which a deduction was allowed under section 170 (for individual taxpayers) or similar Code section for personal holding companies, foreign personal holding companies, or estates or trusts (including a deduction for estate or gift tax purposes).    \\xa0  Nonexempt charitable trust treated as a private foundation.  If a nonexempt charitable trust is treated as though it were a private foundation under section 509, then the fiduciary must file Form 990-PF, Return of Private Foundation, in addition to Form 1041.   If a nonexempt charitable trust is treated as though it were a private foundation, and it has no taxable income under Subtitle A, it may check the box on Form 990-PF, Part VII-A, line 15 and enter the tax-exempt interest received or accrued during the year on that line, instead of filing Form 1041 to meet its section 6012 filing requirement for that tax year.    \\xa0 Excise taxes. If a nonexempt charitable trust is treated as a private foundation, then it is subject to the same excise taxes under chapters 41 and 42 that a private foundation is subject to. If the nonexempt charitable trust is liable for any of these taxes (except the section 4940 tax), then it reports these taxes on Form 4720, Return of Certain Excise Taxes Under Chapters 41 and 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. Taxes paid by the trust on Form 4720 or on Form 990-PF (the section 4940 tax) can\\'t be taken as a deduction on Form 1041.     \\xa0 Not a Private Foundation  Check this box if the nonexempt charitable trust (section 4947(a)(1)) isn\\'t treated as a private foundation under section 509. For more information, see Regulations section 53.4947-1.  Other returns that must be filed.  If a nonexempt charitable trust isn\\'t treated as though it were a private foundation, the fiduciary must file Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax, or Form 990-EZ, Short Form Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax, in addition to Form 1041, if the trust meets the filing requirements for either of those forms.   If a nonexempt charitable trust isn\\'t treated as though it were a private foundation, and it has no taxable income under Subtitle A, it may answer \"Yes\" on Form 990, Part V, line 12a and enter the tax-exempt interest received or accrued during the year on Form 990, Part V, line 12b instead of filing Form 1041 to meet its section 6012 filing requirement for that tax year (or if Form 990-EZ is filed instead of Form 990, you may check the box on Form 990-EZ, line 43 and enter the tax-exempt interest received or accrued during the year on that line).    \\xa0 Section 4947(a)(2) Trust  Check this box if the trust is a split-interest trust described in section 4947(a)(2). A split-interest trust is a trust that:    Isn\\'t exempt from tax under section 501(a);   Has some unexpired interests that are devoted to purposes other than religious, charitable, or similar purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B); and   Has amounts transferred in trust after May 26, 1969, for which a deduction was allowed under section 170 (for individual taxpayers) or similar Code sections for personal holding companies, foreign personal holding companies, or estates or trusts (including a deduction for estate or gift tax purposes).    \\xa0  Other returns that must be filed.  The fiduciary of a split-interest trust must file Form 5227. However, see the Instructions for Form 5227 for the exception that applies to split-interest trusts other than section 664 charitable remainder trusts.      \\xa0 F. Initial Return, Amended Return, etc.  \\xa0 Amended Return  If you are filing an amended Form 1041:    Check the \"Amended return\" box in Item F,   Complete the entire return,   Correct the appropriate lines with the new information, and   Refigure the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax liability.    \\xa0 Note. If you are amending the return for an NOL carryback, also check the \"Net operating loss carryback\" box in Item F. If the total tax on line 24 is larger on the amended return than on the original return, you generally should pay the difference with the amended return. However, you should adjust this amount if there is any increase or decrease in the total payments shown on line 26. Attach a sheet that explains the reason for the amendments and identifies the lines and amounts being changed on the amended return.  Amended Schedule H (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). If you discover an error on a Schedule H that you previously filed with Form 1041, file an \"Amended\" Form 1041 and attach a corrected Schedule H. In the top margin of your corrected Schedule H, write \"CORRECTED\" and the date you discovered the error. Also, on an attachment explain the reason for your correction. If you owe tax, pay the tax in full with your amended Form 1041. If you overpaid tax on a previously filed Schedule H, depending on whether you choose the adjustment or claim for refund process to correct the error, you must either repay or reimburse the employee\\'s share of social security and Medicare tax or get the employee\\'s consent to the filing of a refund claim for their share. See Pub. 926, Household Employer\\'s Tax Guide, for more information.   Amended Schedule K-1 (Form 1041). If the amended return results in a change to income, or a change in distribution of any income or other information provided to a beneficiary, an amended Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) must also be filed with the amended Form 1041 and given to each beneficiary. Check the \"Amended K-1\" box at the top of the amended Schedule K-1.    \\xa0 Final Return  Check this box if this is a final return because the estate or trust has terminated. Also, check the \"Final K-1\" box at the top of Schedule K-1. If, on the final return, there are excess deductions, an unused capital loss carryover, or an NOL carryover, see the instructions for Schedule K-1, box 11, later.   \\xa0 Change in Trust\\'s Name If the name of the trust has changed from the name shown on the prior year\\'s return (or Form SS-4 if this is the first return being filed), be sure to check this box.   \\xa0 Change in Fiduciary If a different fiduciary enters his or her name on the line for Name and title of fiduciary than was shown on the prior year\\'s return (or Form SS-4 if this is the first return being filed) and you didn\\'t file a Form 8822-B, be sure to check this box. If there is a change in the fiduciary whose address is used as the mailing address for the estate or trust after the return is filed, use Form 8822-B to notify the IRS.   \\xa0 Change in Fiduciary\\'s Name If the fiduciary changed his or her name from the name that he or she entered on the prior year\\'s return (or Form SS-4 if this is the first return being filed), be sure to check this box.   \\xa0 Change in Fiduciary\\'s Address If the same fiduciary who filed the prior year\\'s return (or Form SS-4 if this is the first return being filed) files the current year\\'s return and changed the address on the return (including a change to an \"in care of\" name and address), and didn\\'t report the change on Form 8822-B, check this box. If the address shown on Form 1041 changes after you file the form (including a change to an \"in care of\" name and address), file Form 8822-B to notify the IRS of the change.    \\xa0 G. Section 645 Election  If a section 645 election was made by filing Form 8855, check the box in item G. See Special Rule for Certain Revocable Trusts under Who Must File and Form 8855 for more information about this election.   \\xa0 Income  \\xa0 Determining Qualified Business Income The estate\\'s or trust\\'s qualified business income includes items of income, gain, deduction, and loss that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and included or allowed in determining taxable income for the year. This includes the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from trades or business conducted by partnerships (other than PTPs), S corporations, and other estates or trusts. For more information see section 199A, Form 8995 Instructions, and Form 8995-A Instructions.   \\xa0 Special Rule for Blind Trust  If you are reporting income from a qualified blind trust (under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978), don\\'t identify the payer of any income to the trust but complete the rest of the return as provided in the instructions. Also write \"Blind Trust\" at the top of page 1.   \\xa0 Extraterritorial Income Exclusion  The extraterritorial income exclusion isn\\'t allowed for transactions after 2006. However, income from certain long-term sales and leases may still qualify for the exclusion. For details and to figure the amount of the exclusion, see Form 8873, Extraterritorial Income Exclusion, and its separate instructions. The estate or trust must report the extraterritorial income exclusion on line 15a of Form 1041, page 1. Although the extraterritorial income exclusion is entered on line 15a, it is an exclusion from income and should be treated as tax-exempt income when completing other parts of the return.   \\xa0 Line 1—Interest Income  Report the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of all taxable interest income that was received during the tax year. Examples of taxable interest include interest from:    Accounts (including certificates of deposit and money market accounts) with banks, credit unions, and thrift institutions;   Notes, loans, and mortgages;   U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds;   U.S. savings bonds;   Original issue discount; and   Income received as a regular interest holder of a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC).    \\xa0 For taxable bonds acquired after 1987, amortizable bond premium is treated as an offset to the interest income instead of as a separate interest deduction. See Pub. 550. For the year of the decedent\\'s death, Forms 1099-INT issued in the decedent\\'s name may include interest income earned after the date of death that should be reported on the income tax return of the decedent\\'s estate. When preparing the decedent\\'s final income tax return, report on Schedule B (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 1 the total interest shown on Form 1099-INT. Under the last entry on line 1, subtotal all the interest reported on line 1. Below the subtotal, write \"Form 1041\" and the name and address shown on Form 1041 for the decedent\\'s estate. Also, show the part of the interest reported on Form 1041 and subtract it from the subtotal.   \\xa0 Line 2a—Total Ordinary Dividends Report the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of all ordinary dividends received during the tax year. For the year of the decedent\\'s death, Forms 1099-DIV issued in the decedent\\'s name may include dividends earned after the date of death that should be reported on the income tax return of the decedent\\'s estate. When preparing the decedent\\'s final income tax return, report on Schedule B (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 5 the ordinary dividends shown on Form 1099-DIV. Under the last entry on line 5, subtotal all the dividends reported on line 5. Below the subtotal, write \"Form 1041\" and the name and address shown on Form 1041 for the decedent\\'s estate. Also, show the part of the ordinary dividends reported on Form 1041 and subtract it from the subtotal.  \\xa0 Report capital gain distributions on Schedule D (Form 1041), Line 13.   \\xa0 Line 2b—Qualified Dividends Enter the beneficiary\\'s allocable share of qualified dividends on line 2b(1) and enter the estate\\'s or trust\\'s allocable share on line 2b(2). If the estate or trust received qualified dividends that were derived from IRD, you must reduce the amount on line 2b(2) by the portion of the estate tax deduction claimed on Form 1041, page 1, line 19, that is attributable to those qualified dividends. Don\\'t reduce the amounts on line 2b by any other allocable expenses.  Note. The beneficiary\\'s share (as figured above) may differ from the amount entered on line 2b of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).   Qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are eligible for a lower tax rate than other ordinary income. Generally, these dividends are reported to the estate or trust in box 1b of Form(s) 1099-DIV. See Pub. 550 for the definition of qualified dividends if the estate or trust received dividends not reported on Form 1099-DIV.  \\xa0 Exception. Some dividends may be reported to the estate or trust as in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV but aren\\'t qualified dividends. These include:     Dividends received on any share of stock that the estate or trust held for less than 61 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the purchaser of a stock isn\\'t entitled to receive the next dividend payment. When counting the number of days the stock was held, include the day the estate or trust disposed of the stock but not the day it acquired the stock. However, you can\\'t count certain days during which the estate\\'s or trust\\'s risk of loss was diminished. See Pub. 550 for more details.   Dividends attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days that the estate or trust received on any share of preferred stock held for less than 91 days during the 181-day period that began 90 days before the ex-dividend date. When counting the number of days the stock was held, include the day the estate or trust disposed of the stock but not the day it acquired the stock. However, you can\\'t count certain days during which the estate\\'s or trust\\'s risk of loss was diminished. See Pub. 550 for more details. Preferred dividends attributable to periods totaling less than 367 days are subject to the 61-day holding period rule above.   Dividends on any share of stock to the extent that the estate or trust is under an obligation (including a short sale) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.   Payments in lieu of dividends, but only if you know or have reason to know that the payments are not qualified dividends.    \\xa0   \\xa0 If you have an entry on line 2b(2), be sure you use Schedule D (Form 1041), the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, or the Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet, whichever applies, to figure the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax. Figuring the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax liability in this manner will usually result in a lower tax.    \\xa0 Line 3—Business Income or (Loss) If the estate operated a business, report the income and expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Profit or Loss From Business. Enter the net profit or (loss) from Schedule C on line 3.   \\xa0 Line 4—Capital Gain or (Loss) Enter the gain from Schedule D (Form 1041), Part III, line 19, column (3) or the loss from Part IV, line 20. If you deferred a capital gain in to a qualified opportunity fund (QOF), you must file your return with Schedule D, Form 8949 and Form 8997 attached. You will need to file Form 8997 annually until you dispose of the investment. See the Form 8997 instructions.  \\xa0 Don\\'t substitute Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for Schedule D (Form 1041).   \\xa0 Line 5—Rents, Royalties, Partnerships, Other Estates and Trusts, etc. Use Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Supplemental Income and Loss, to report the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of income or (losses) from rents, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, other estates and trusts, and REMICs. Also use Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) to report farm rental income and expenses based on crops or livestock produced by a tenant. Enter the net profit or (loss) from Schedule E on line 5. See the Instructions for Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for reporting requirements. If the estate or trust received a Schedule K-1 from a partnership, S corporation, or other flow-through entity, use the corresponding lines on Form 1041 to report the interest, dividends, capital gains, etc., from the flow-through entity.   \\xa0 Line 6—Farm Income or (Loss) If the estate or trust operated a farm, use Schedule F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Profit or Loss From Farming, to report farm income and expenses. Enter the net profit or (loss) from Schedule F on line 6.  \\xa0 If an estate or trust has farm rental income and expenses based on crops or livestock produced by a tenant, report the income and expenses on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). Don\\'t use Form 4835, Farm Rental Income and Expenses, or Schedule F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) to report such income and expenses and don\\'t include the net profit or (loss) from such income and expenses on line 6.   \\xa0 Line 7—Ordinary Gain or (Loss) Enter from line 17, Form 4797, Sales of Business Property, the ordinary gain or loss from the sale or exchange of property other than capital assets and also from involuntary conversions (other than casualty or theft).   \\xa0 Line 8—Other Income Enter other items of income not included on lines 1, 2a, and 3 through 7. List the type and amount on an attached schedule if the estate or trust has more than one item. Items to be reported on line 8 include the following.    Section 461(I) excess business loss adjustments. Write \"ELA\" and the amount from Form 461, line 16 as a positive number on the entry space on line 8. Include this amount in the total of all Other Income on line 8. See Form 461 and its instructions for more information. Note. \"ELA\" and its dollar amount are the first entry to make on line 8.   Unpaid compensation received by the decedent\\'s estate that is IRD.   Any part of a total distribution shown on Form 1099-R, Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc., that is treated as ordinary income. For more information, see Form 4972, Tax on Lump-Sum Distributions, and its instructions.   Taxable contributions received during the tax year by an Alaska Native Settlement Trust from an Alaska Native Corporation. Report gain from taxable contributions of non-cash property on Schedule D (Form 1041).   Net section 965(a) inclusion. If you have a net section 965(a) inclusion for 2019, write “SEC 965” in the entry space and enter the net inclusion amount on line 8. The net 965(a) inclusion is figured by subtracting the 965(c) deduction (Form 965, Part II, line 17) from the 965(a) inclusion (Form 965, Part I, line 3). You must also complete and attach Form 965 and Form 965-A to your return. See the Instructions for Form 965 for more information.    \\xa0    \\xa0 Deductions  \\xa0 Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization A trust or decedent\\'s estate is allowed a deduction for depreciation, depletion, and amortization only to the extent the deductions aren\\'t apportioned to the beneficiaries. An estate or trust isn\\'t allowed to make an election under section 179 to expense depreciable business assets. The estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of depreciation, depletion, and amortization is generally reported on the appropriate lines of Schedule C, E, or F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), the net income or loss from which is shown on lines 3, 5, or 6 of Form 1041. If the deduction isn\\'t related to a specific business or activity, then report it on line 15a.  Depreciation. For a decedent\\'s estate, the depreciation deduction is apportioned between the estate and the heirs, legatees, and devisees on the basis of the estate\\'s income allocable to each. For a trust, the depreciation deduction is apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trust on the basis of the trust income allocable to each, unless the governing instrument (or local law) requires or permits the trustee to maintain a depreciation reserve. If the trustee is required to maintain a reserve, the deduction is first allocated to the trust, up to the amount of the reserve. Any excess is allocated among the income beneficiaries and the trust in the same manner as the trust\\'s accounting income. See Regulations section 1.167(h)-1(b).   Depletion. For mineral or timber property held by a decedent\\'s estate, the depletion deduction is apportioned between the estate and the heirs, legatees, and devisees on the basis of the estate\\'s income from such property allocable to each. For mineral or timber property held in trust, the depletion deduction is apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trust based on the trust income from such property allocable to each, unless the governing instrument (or local law) requires or permits the trustee to maintain a reserve for depletion. If the trustee is required to maintain a reserve, the deduction is first allocated to the trust, up to the amount of the reserve. Any excess is allocated among the beneficiaries and the trust in the same manner as the trust\\'s accounting income. See Regulations section 1.611-1(c)(4).   Amortization. The deduction for amortization is apportioned between an estate or trust and its beneficiaries under the same principles used to apportion the deductions for depreciation and depletion. The deduction for the amortization of reforestation expenditures under section 194 is allowed only to an estate.   Allocable share from a pass-through entity. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization received from a pass-through entity on a Schedule K-1 is apportioned and reported in the same manner as discussed above. A section 179 expense received from a pass-through entity on a Schedule K-1 isn\\'t deductible by the estate or trust.    \\xa0 Allocation of Deductions for Tax-Exempt Income Generally, no deduction that would otherwise be allowable is allowed for any expense (whether for business or for the production of income) that is allocable to tax-exempt income. Examples of tax-exempt income include:    Certain death benefits (section 101),   Interest on state or local bonds (section 103),   Compensation for injuries or sickness (section 104), and   Income from discharge of indebtedness in a title 11 case (section 108).    \\xa0  Exception. State income taxes and business expenses that are allocable to tax-exempt interest are deductible. Expenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt income are allocated only to tax-exempt income. A reasonable proportion of expenses indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt income and other income must be allocated to each class of income.    \\xa0 Deductions That May Be Allowable for Estate Tax Purposes Administration expenses and casualty and theft losses deductible on Form 706 may be deducted, to the extent otherwise deductible for income tax purposes, on Form 1041 if the fiduciary files a statement waiving the right to deduct the expenses and losses on Form 706. The statement must be filed before the expiration of the statutory period of limitations for the tax year the deduction is claimed. See Pub. 559 for more information.   \\xa0 Accrued Expenses Generally, an accrual basis taxpayer can deduct accrued expenses in the tax year that: (a) all events have occurred that determine the liability; and (b) the amount of the liability can be figured with reasonable accuracy. However, all the events that establish liability are treated as occurring only when economic performance takes place. There are exceptions for recurring items. See section 461(h).    \\xa0 Limitations on Deductions  \\xa0 At-Risk Loss Limitations Generally, the amount the estate or trust has \"at-risk\" limits the loss it can deduct for any tax year. Use Form 6198, At-Risk Limitations, to figure the deductible loss for the year and file it with Form 1041. For more information, see Pub. 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.   \\xa0 Passive Activity Loss and Credit Limitations  In general. Section 469 and the regulations thereunder generally limit losses from passive activities to the amount of income derived from all passive activities. Similarly, credits from passive activities are generally limited to the tax attributable to such activities. These limitations are first applied at the estate or trust level. Generally, an activity is a passive activity if it involves the conduct of any trade or business, and the taxpayer does not materially participate in the activity. Passive activities don\\'t include working interests in oil and gas properties. See section 469(c)(3).   Note. Material participation standards for estates and trusts haven\\'t been established by regulations.  \\xa0 For a grantor trust, material participation is determined at the grantor level. If the estate or trust distributes an interest in a passive activity, the basis of the property immediately before the distribution is increased by the passive activity losses allocable to the interest, and such losses can\\'t be deducted. See section 469(j)(12).  \\xa0 Losses from passive activities are first subject to the at-risk rules. When the losses are deductible under the at-risk rules, the passive activity rules then apply.   Rental activities. Generally, rental activities are passive activities, whether or not the taxpayer materially participates. However, certain taxpayers who materially participate in real property trades or businesses aren\\'t subject to the passive activity limitations on losses from rental real estate activities in which they materially participate. For more details, see section 469(c)(7). For tax years of an estate ending less than 2 years after the decedent\\'s date of death, up to $25,000 of deductions and deduction equivalents of credits from rental real estate activities in which the decedent actively participated are allowed. Any excess losses or credits are suspended for the year and carried forward.   Portfolio income. Portfolio income isn\\'t treated as income from a passive activity, and passive losses and credits generally may not be applied to offset it. Portfolio income generally includes interest, dividends, royalties, and income from annuities. Portfolio income of an estate or trust must be accounted for separately.   Forms to file. See Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations, to figure the amount of losses allowed from passive activities. See Form 8582-CR, Passive Activity Credit Limitations, to figure the amount of credit allowed for the current year.    \\xa0 Business Interest Business interest expense could be limited. For more information about limitations on deductions for business interest, see section 163(j) and Line 10-Interest, later.   \\xa0 Transactions Between Related Taxpayers Under section 267, a trust that uses the accrual method of accounting may only deduct business expenses and interest owed to a related party in the year the payment is included in the income of the related party. For this purpose, a related party includes:    A grantor and a fiduciary of any trust;   A fiduciary of a trust and a fiduciary of another trust, if the same person is a grantor of both trusts;   A fiduciary of a trust and a beneficiary of such trust;   A fiduciary of a trust and a beneficiary of another trust, if the same person is a grantor of both trusts;   A fiduciary of a trust and a corporation more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the trust or by or for a person who is a grantor of the trust; and   An executor of an estate and a beneficiary of that estate, except for a sale or exchange to satisfy a pecuniary bequest (that is, a bequest of a sum of money).    \\xa0   \\xa0 Line 10—Interest Enter the amount of interest (subject to limitations) paid or incurred by the estate or trust on amounts borrowed by the estate or trust, or on debt acquired by the estate or trust (for example, outstanding obligations from the decedent) that isn\\'t claimed elsewhere on the return. If the proceeds of a loan were used for more than one purpose (for example, to purchase a portfolio investment and to acquire an interest in a passive activity), the fiduciary must make an interest allocation according to the rules in Temporary Regulations section 1.163-8T. Don\\'t include interest paid on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations on which the interest is wholly exempt from income tax. Personal interest isn\\'t deductible. Examples of personal interest include interest paid on:    Revolving charge accounts used to purchase personal use property;   Personal notes for money borrowed from a bank, credit union, or other person;   Installment loans on personal use property; and   Underpayments of federal, state, or local income taxes.    \\xa0 Interest that is paid or incurred on indebtedness allocable to a trade or business (including a rental activity) should be deducted on the appropriate line of Schedule C, E, or F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), the net income or loss from which is shown on line 3, 5, or 6 of Form 1041. Types of interest to include on line 10 are:    Any investment interest (subject to limitations—see below);   Any qualified residence interest (see later); and   Any interest payable under section 6601 on any unpaid portion of the estate tax attributable to the value of a reversionary or remainder interest in property for the period during which an extension of time for payment of such tax is in effect.    \\xa0  Limitation on deduction of business interest. Business interest expense is limited to the sum of business interest income, 30% of the adjusted taxable income and floor plan financing interest. Business interest expense includes any interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to a trade or business. A taxpayer, other than a tax shelter, that meets the gross receipts test is not required to limit business interest expense under section 163(j). A taxpayer meets the gross receipts test if the taxpayer has average annual gross receipts of $26 million or less for the 3 prior tax years. Gross receipts include the aggregate gross receipts from all persons treated as a single employer such as a controlled group of corporations, commonly controlled partnerships or proprietorships, and affiliated service groups. If the taxpayer fails to meet the gross receipts test, Form 8990, Limitation on Business Interest Expense Under Section 163(j), is generally required.    Investment interest. Generally, investment interest is interest (including amortizable bond premium on taxable bonds acquired after October 22, 1986, but before January 1, 1988) that is paid or incurred on indebtedness that is properly allocable to property held for investment. Investment interest doesn\\'t include any qualified residence interest, or interest that is taken into account under section 469 in figuring income or loss from a passive activity. Generally, net investment income is the excess of investment income over investment expenses. Investment expenses (other than interest) are deductible only to the extent they are allowable under section 67(e). The amount of the investment interest deduction may be limited. Use Form 4952, Investment Interest Expense Deduction, to figure the allowable investment interest deduction. If you must complete Form 4952, check the box on line 10 of Form 1041 and attach Form 4952. Then, add the deductible investment interest to the other types of deductible interest and enter the total on line 10.   Qualified residence interest. Interest paid or incurred by an estate or trust on indebtedness secured by a qualified residence of a beneficiary of an estate or trust is treated as qualified residence interest if the residence would be a qualified residence (that is, the principal residence or the secondary residence selected by the beneficiary) if owned by the beneficiary. The beneficiary must have a present interest in the estate or trust or an interest in the residuary of the estate or trust. See Pub. 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction, for an explanation of the general rules for deducting home mortgage interest. See section 163(h)(3) for a definition of qualified residence interest and for limitations on indebtedness.   Qualified mortgage insurance premiums. Enter (on the worksheet later) the qualified mortgage insurance premiums paid under a mortgage insurance contract issued after December 31, 2006, in connection with qualified residence acquisition debt that was secured by a principal or secondary residence. See Prepaid mortgage insurance below if the estate or trust paid any premiums allocable after 2019. If at least one other person was liable for and paid the premiums in connection with the loan, and the premiums were reported on Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, include the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of the 2019 premiums on the worksheet later.  Qualified mortgage insurance is mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Housing Administration, or the Rural Housing Service (or their successor organizations), and private mortgage insurance (as defined in section 2 of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 as in effect on December 20, 2006). Mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Rural Housing Service is commonly known as a funding fee and guarantee fee, respectively. These fees can be deducted fully in 2019 if the mortgage insurance contract was issued in 2019. Contact the mortgage insurance issuer to determine the deductible amount if it is not included in box 5 of Form 1098.  \\xa0 Qualified Mortgage Insurance Premiums Deduction Worksheet                  \\xa0 \\xa0   1. \\xa0 Enter the total premiums the estate or trust paid in 2019 for qualified mortgage insurance for a contract issued after December 31, 2006 1. _____ \\xa0   2. \\xa0 Enter the estate\\'s or trust\\'s AGI 2. _____ \\xa0 \\xa0   3. \\xa0 Enter $100,000 3. _____ \\xa0 \\xa0   4. \\xa0 Is the amount on line 2 more than the amount on line 3? \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 No.  The deduction is not limited.

Enter the result here and include the amount on Form 1041, line 10  7. _____ \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0        \\xa0 Prepaid mortgage insurance. If the estate or trust paid mortgage insurance premiums allocable to periods after 2019, such premiums must be allocated over the shorter of:    The stated term of the mortgage, or   84 months, beginning with the month the insurance was obtained.    \\xa0 The premiums are treated as paid in the year to which they are allocated. If the mortgage is satisfied before its term, no deduction is allowed for the unamortized balance. See Pub. 936 for details. These allocation rules do not apply to qualified mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Rural Housing Service (or their successor organizations).   \\xa0 Limit on the amount that is deductible. The estate or trust cannot deduct mortgage insurance premiums if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s AGI is more than $109,000. If the estate\\'s or trust\\'s AGI is more than $100,000, its deduction is limited and you must use the Qualified Mortgage Insurance Premiums Deduction Worksheet, above, to figure the deduction. See Adjusted gross income (AGI), earlier, for information on figuring AGI.    \\xa0 Line 11—Taxes  \\xa0 The deduction for state and local taxes is limited to $10,000. The limitation applies to the total of your state and local income taxes (or general sales taxes, if elected instead of income taxes), real estate taxes, and personal property taxes. The limitation does not apply to foreign income taxes, and state and local taxes paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business or for the production of income. Enter any deductible taxes paid or incurred during the tax year that aren\\'t deductible elsewhere on Form 1041. Deductible taxes include the following:    State and local income taxes. You can deduct state and local income taxes unless you elect to deduct state and local general sales taxes. You can\\'t deduct both.   State and local general sales taxes. You can elect to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes. Generally, you can elect to deduct the actual state and local general sales taxes (including compensating use taxes) you paid in 2019 if the tax rate was the same as the general sales tax rate. However, sales taxes on food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles are deductible as a general sales tax even if the tax rate was less than the general sales tax rate. Sales taxes on motor vehicles are also deductible as a general sales tax if the tax rate was more than the general sales tax rate, but the tax is deductible only up to the amount of tax that would have been imposed at the general sales tax rate. Motor vehicles include cars, motorcycles, motor homes, recreational vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, and off-road vehicles. Also include any state and local general sales taxes paid for a leased motor vehicle. Do not include sales taxes paid on items used in a trade or business. An estate or trust cannot use the Optional Sales Tax Tables for individuals in the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Itemized Deductions, to figure its deduction.   State and local real property taxes.  Note. The deduction for foreign real property taxes is no longer allowed.    State and local personal property taxes.   Foreign or U.S. possession income taxes. You may want to take a credit for the tax instead of a deduction. See the instructions for Schedule G, Part I, line 2a, later, for more details.   The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax imposed on income distributions.    \\xa0 Don\\'t deduct:    Federal income taxes;   Estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, and gift taxes;   Federal duties and excise taxes; or   Foreign real property taxes.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Line 12—Fiduciary Fees Enter the deductible fees paid or incurred to the fiduciary for administering the estate or trust during the tax year. Fiduciary expenses include probate court fees and costs, fiduciary bond premiums, legal publication costs of notices to creditors or heirs, the cost of certified copies of the decedent\\'s death certificate, and costs related to fiduciary accounts.  \\xa0 Fiduciary fees deducted on Form 706 can\\'t be deducted on Form 1041.   Note. Fiduciary fees are allowable under section 67(e) if they are costs that are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of an estate or a non-grantor trust that would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such estate or trust. See Notice 2018-61 and Regulations section 1.67-4 available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2014-22_IRB/ar05.html, amended at IRS.gov/irb/2014–32_IRB/ar06.html for more information.   \\xa0 Line 14—Attorney, Accountant, and Return Preparer Fees Expenses for preparation of fiduciary income tax returns, the decedent\\'s final individual income tax returns, and all estate and generation-skipping transfer tax returns, are fully deductible. However, expenses for preparing all other tax returns, including gift tax returns, are considered costs commonly and customarily incurred by individuals and are not deductible. For more information, see Notice 2018-61 and Regulations section 1.67-4.   \\xa0 Line 15a—Other Deductions Attach your own statement, listing by type and amount all allowable deductions that aren\\'t deductible elsewhere on Form 1041. Allowable deductions include all deductions listed in section 67(b) (including estate taxes attributable to IRD under section 691(c)), and other costs allowable under section 67(e) paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust that would not have been incurred if the property were not held in the estate or trust. Don\\'t include any losses on worthless bonds and similar obligations and nonbusiness bad debts. Report these losses as applicable on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets. Don\\'t deduct medical or funeral expenses on Form 1041. Medical expenses of the decedent paid by the estate may be deductible on the decedent\\'s income tax return for the year incurred. See section 213(c). Funeral expenses are deductible only on Form 706.  Other costs paid or incurred by estates and non-grantor trusts. Under section 67(e), deductions are allowable for costs which are paid or incurred by an estate or non-grantor trust in connection with the administration of the estate or trust and would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate.  In determining whether a cost is deductible by an estate or non-grantor trust it must be determined whether the cost would be “commonly or customarily” incurred by a hypothetical individual owning the same property. If the cost would be deductible by a hypothetical individual, it is not deductible by the estate or non-grantor trust. It is the type of product or service rendered to the estate or non-grantor trust in exchange for the cost, rather than the description of the cost of that product or service that is determinative. Costs that are incurred commonly or customarily by individuals include costs incurred in defense of a claim against the estate, the decedent, or the non-grantor trust that are unrelated to the existence, validity, or administration of the estate or trust. These amounts are not allowable deductions.    Ownership costs. Ownership costs are costs that are chargeable to or incurred by an owner of property simply by reason of being the owner of the property. These costs are commonly or customarily incurred by a hypothetical individual owner of such property and are not deductible by an estate or non-grantor trust. Under section 67(b), they include, but are not limited to, condominium fees, insurance premiums, maintenance and lawn services, automobile registration and insurance costs, and partnership costs deemed to be passed through to and reportable by a partner. Other expenses incurred merely by reason of the ownership of property may be fully deductible under other provisions of the Code.   Appraisal fees. Appraisal fees incurred to determine the fair market value of assets as of the decedent\\'s date of death (or the alternate valuation date), to determine value for purposes of making distributions, or as otherwise required to properly prepare the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax returns, or a generation-skipping transfer tax return, are not incurred commonly or customarily by an individual and are deductible. The cost of appraisals for other purposes (for example, insurance) is commonly or customarily incurred by individuals and is not an allowable deduction.   Investment advisory fees. Fees for investment advice, including any related services that would be provided to any individual investor as part of an investment advisory fee, are incurred commonly or customarily by a hypothetical individual investor and are not deductible. However, certain incremental costs of investment advice beyond the amount that normally would be charged to an individual investor are deductible. An incremental cost is a special, additional charge that is added solely because the investment advice is rendered to a trust or estate rather than to an individual, including balancing beyond the usual varying interests of current beneficiaries and remaindermen. The deductible portion of the investment advisory fees is limited to the amount of those fees, if any, that exceeds the fees normally charged to an individual investor. See Regulations section 1.67-4(b)(4).   Bundled fees. If an estate or non-grantor trust pays a single fee, commission, or other expense, such as a fiduciary\\'s commission, attorney\\'s fee, or accountant\\'s fee for both costs that are incurred commonly or customarily by individuals and costs (other than a de minimis amount) that are not incurred commonly or customarily by individuals, then (except to the extent provided otherwise by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin) the single fee, commission, or other expense (bundled fee) must be allocated, between the costs that are incurred commonly or customarily by individuals, such costs not being deductible, and costs that are not incurred commonly or customarily by individuals, such costs being deductible. There is an exception to the allocation rule if a bundled fee is not computed on an hourly basis. In this situation, only the portion of that fee that is attributable to investment advice is not deductible. The remaining portion is deductible. Out-of-pocket expenses billed to the estate or non-grantor trust are treated as separate from the bundled fee and are not subject to allocation. Estates and non-grantor trusts cannot deduct payments made from the bundled fee to third parties if such payments would not have been deductible if they had been paid directly by the estate or non-grantor trust. Any reasonable method may be used to allocate a bundled fee, including without limitation the allocation of a portion of a fiduciary commission that is a bundled fee to investment advice. For more information, see Regulations section 1.67-4(c)(4). Note. The reasonable method standard does not apply to determine the portion of the bundled fee attributable to payments made to third parties for commonly or customarily incurred by an individual or to any other separately assessed expense commonly or customarily incurred by an individual, because those payments and expenses are readily identifiable without any discretion on the part of the fiduciary or return preparer. For more information, see Regulations 1.67-4.   \\xa0    Other deductions reported on line 15a.     Bond premium(s). For taxable bonds acquired before October 23, 1986, if the fiduciary elected to amortize the premium, report the amortization on this line. If you made the election to amortize the premium, the basis in the taxable bond must be reduced by the amount of amortization. For tax-exempt bonds, you can\\'t deduct the premium that is amortized. Although the premium can\\'t be deducted, you must amortize the tax-exempt bond by the amount of premium amortized. For more information, see section 171 and Pub. 550. If you claim a bond premium deduction for the estate or trust, figure the deduction on a separate sheet and attach it to Form 1041.    Casualty and theft losses. Use Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts, to figure any deductible casualty and theft losses.   Estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of amortization, depreciation, and depletion not claimed elsewhere. If you can\\'t deduct the estate\\'s or trust\\'s apportioned share of amortization, depreciation, and depletion as rent or royalty expenses on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), or as business or farm expenses on Schedule C, or F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), itemize the estate\\'s or trust\\'s apportioned share of the deductions on an attached sheet and include them on line 15a.   Note. Don\\'t report the beneficiary\\'s apportioned share of depreciation, depletion, and amortization on line 15a. Report the beneficiary\\'s apportioned share of deductions on Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 9.  \\xa0 Itemize each beneficiary\\'s apportioned share of the deductions and report them in the appropriate box of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).    \\xa0 Line15b—Net Operating Loss Deduction An estate or trust is allowed a net operating loss deduction (NOLD) under section 172. If you claim a NOLD for the estate or trust, figure the deduction on a separate sheet and attach it to the return.   \\xa0 Line 18—Income Distribution Deduction  If the estate or trust was required to distribute income currently or if it paid, credited, or was required to distribute any other amounts to beneficiaries during the tax year, complete Schedule B to determine the estate\\'s or trust\\'s income distribution deduction. However, if you are filing for a pooled income fund, don\\'t complete Schedule B. Instead, attach a statement to support the computation of the income distribution deduction. For more information, see Pooled Income Funds, earlier. If the estate or trust claims an income distribution deduction, complete and attach:    Part I (through line 24) and Part II of Schedule I (Form 1041) to refigure the deduction on a minimum tax basis, and   Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) for each beneficiary to which a distribution was made or required to be made.    \\xa0  Cemetery perpetual care fund.  On line 18, deduct the amount, not more than $5 per gravesite, paid for maintenance of cemetery property. To the right of the entry space for line 18, enter the number of gravesites. Also write \"Section 642(i) trust\" in parentheses after the trust\\'s name at the top of Form 1041. You don\\'t have to complete Schedules B of Form 1041 and K-1 (Form 1041).   Don\\'t enter less than zero on line 18.    \\xa0 Line 19—Estate Tax Deduction (Including Certain Generation-Skipping Transfer Taxes)  If the estate or trust includes IRD in its gross income, and such amount was included in the decedent\\'s gross estate for estate tax purposes, the estate or trust is allowed to deduct in the same tax year that the income is included that portion of the estate tax imposed on the decedent\\'s estate that is attributable to the inclusion of the IRD in the decedent\\'s estate. For an example of the computation, see Regulations section 1.691(c)-1 and Pub. 559. If any amount properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed by an estate or trust to a beneficiary consists of IRD received by the estate or trust, don\\'t include such amounts in determining the estate tax deduction for the estate or trust. Figure the deduction on a separate sheet. Attach the sheet to your return.  \\xa0 If you claim a deduction for estate tax attributable to qualified dividends or capital gains, you may have to adjust the amount on Form 1041, page 1, line 2b(2), or Schedule D (Form 1041), line 22. Also, a deduction is allowed for the GST tax imposed as a result of a taxable termination or a direct skip occurring as a result of the death of the transferor. See section 691(c)(3). Enter the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of these deductions on line 19.   \\xa0 Line 20—Qualified Business Income Deduction  To figure your Qualified Business Income Deduction, use Form 8995, Qualified Business Income Deduction Simplified Computation, or Form 8995-A, Qualified Business Income Deduction, as applicable.  Use Form 8995 if:    You have qualified business income (loss), REIT dividends, or PTP income (loss),   Your 2019 taxable income before the qualified business income deduction is less than or equal to $160,700, and   You aren’t a patron in a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative.      If you don’t meet these requirements, use Form 8995-A. See instructions for Forms 8995 and 8995-A for more information for figuring and reporting your QBI deduction.  Note. Report the beneficiary’s apportioned share of items of qualified business income (loss) subject to beneficiary specific determinations, W-2 wages, unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income on a statement attached to Schedule K-1 (Form 1041). See the Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 14, code I, later.  \\xa0   \\xa0 Line 21—Exemption   Decedents\\' estates.  A decedent\\'s estate is allowed a $600 exemption.   Trusts required to distribute all income currently.  A trust whose governing instrument requires that all income be distributed currently is allowed a $300 exemption, even if it distributed amounts other than income during the tax year.   Qualified disability trusts.  A qualified disability trust is allowed a $4,200 exemption. This amount is not subject to phaseout.   A qualified disability trust is any trust:       Described in 42 U.S.C. 1396p(c)(2)(B)(iv) and established solely for the benefit of an individual under 65 years of age who is disabled, and   All of the beneficiaries of which are determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to have been disabled for some part of the tax year within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3).      \\xa0   A trust will not fail to meet item 2 above just because the trust\\'s corpus may revert to a person who isn\\'t disabled after the trust ceases to have any disabled beneficiaries.   All other trusts. A trust not described above is allowed a $100 exemption.     \\xa0 Tax and Payments  \\xa0 Line 23—Taxable Income   Minimum taxable income.  Line 23 can\\'t be less than the larger of:       The inversion gain of the estate or trust, as figured under section 7874, if the estate or trust is an expatriated entity or a partner in an expatriated entity, or   The sum of the excess inclusions of the estate or trust from Schedule Q (Form 1066), Quarterly Notice to Residual Interest Holder of REMIC Taxable Income or Net Loss Allocation, line 2c.      \\xa0   Net operating loss (NOL).  If line 23 (figured without regard to the minimum taxable income rule stated above) is a loss, the estate or trust may have an NOL. Don\\'t include the deductions claimed on lines 13, 18, and 21 when figuring the amount of the NOL.   Generally, an NOL can only be carried forward to subsequent years and cannot be carried back. The 2-year carryback period only applies to the portion of an NOL attributable to a farming loss. For more information, see Pub. 536, Net Operating Losses (NOLs) for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts.    Complete Schedule A of Form 1045 to figure the amount of the NOL that is available for carryback or carryover. Use Form 1045 or file an amended return to apply for a refund based on an NOL carryback. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 1045, Application for Tentative Refund.   On the termination of the estate or trust, any unused NOL carryover that would be allowable to the estate or trust in a later tax year, but for the termination, is allowed to the beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate or trust. See the instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 11, codes D and E, later.   Excess deductions on termination. If the estate or trust has for its final year deductions (excluding the charitable deduction and exemption) in excess of its gross income, the excess is allowed as an itemized deduction to the beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate or trust. In general, an unused NOL carryover that is allowed to beneficiaries (as explained above) can\\'t also be treated as an excess deduction. However, if the final year of the estate or trust is also the last year of the NOL carryover period, the NOL carryover not absorbed in that tax year by the estate or trust is included as an excess deduction. See the instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 11, code A, later.     \\xa0 Line 25—2019 Net 965 Tax Liability Paid If you made a payment with respect to a 2019 net 965 tax liability, enter the amount of the payment from Form 965-A, Part II, column (k), line 3. \\xa0  Note. Include on line 25 amounts paid related to the net 965 tax liability attributable to the S portion of an ESBT. See Schedule G, Part I, Line 4 -Tax on ESBTs, later, for more information.  \\xa0   \\xa0 Line 27—Estimated Tax Penalty  If line 27 is at least $1,000 and more than 10% of the tax shown on Form 1041, or the estate or trust underpaid its 2019 estimated tax liability for any payment period, it may owe a penalty. See Form 2210 to determine whether the estate or trust owes a penalty and to figure the amount of the penalty.  Note. The penalty may be waived or reduced under certain conditions. See Pub. 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax, and the Instructions for Form 2210 for details.  \\xa0   \\xa0 Line 28—Tax Due You must pay the tax in full when the return is filed. You may pay by EFTPS. For more information about EFTPS, see Electronic Deposits, earlier. Also, you may pay by check or money order or by credit or debit card.  To pay by check or money order.  If you pay by check or money order:    Make it payable to \"United States Treasury\",   Make sure the name of the estate or trust appears on the payment,   Write the estate’s or trust’s EIN and \"2019 Form 1041\" on the payment,   Consider completing the 2019 Form 1041-V, and   Enclose, but don\\'t attach, the payment (and Form 1041-V, if completed) with Form 1041.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Note. The IRS can\\'t accept a single check (including a cashier\\'s check) for amounts of $100,000,000 ($100 million) or more. If you\\'re sending $100 million or more by check, you\\'ll need to spread the payments over two or more checks with each check made out for an amount less than $100 million. The $100 million or more amount limit doesn\\'t apply to other methods of payment (such as electronic payments), so please consider paying by means other than checks.    To pay by credit or debit card.  For information on paying your taxes electronically, including by credit or debit card, go to IRS.gov/E-pay.    \\xa0 Line 30a—Credited to 2020 Estimated Tax  Enter the amount from line 29 that you want applied to the estate\\'s or trust\\'s 2020 estimated tax.    \\xa0 Schedule A—Charitable Deduction   \\xa0 General Instructions Generally, any part of the gross income of an estate or trust (other than a simple trust) that, under the terms of the will or governing instrument, is paid (or treated as paid) during the tax year for a charitable purpose specified in section 170(c) is allowed as a deduction to the estate or trust. It isn\\'t necessary that the charitable organization be created or organized in the United States. A pooled income fund or a section 4947(a)(1) nonexempt charitable trust  treated as a private foundation must attach a separate sheet to Form 1041 instead of using Schedule A of Form 1041 to figure the charitable deduction.  Additional return to be filed by trusts. Trusts, other than split-interest trusts or nonexempt charitable trusts, that claim a charitable deduction also file Form 1041-A unless the trust is required to distribute currently to the beneficiaries all the income for the year determined under section 643(b) and related regulations. Pooled income funds and charitable lead trusts also file Form 5227. See Form 5227 for information about any exceptions.   Election to treat contributions as paid in the prior tax year.  The fiduciary of an estate or trust may elect to treat as paid during the tax year any amount of gross income received during that tax year or any prior tax year that was paid in the next tax year for a charitable purpose.   For example, if a calendar year estate or trust makes a qualified charitable contribution on February 7, 2020, from income earned in 2019 or prior, then the fiduciary can elect to treat the contribution as paid in 2019.   To make the election, the fiduciary must file a statement with Form 1041 for the tax year in which the contribution is treated as paid. This statement must include:       The name and address of the fiduciary;   The name of the estate or trust;   An indication that the fiduciary is making an election under section 642(c)(1) for contributions treated as paid during such tax year;   The name and address of each organization to which any such contribution is paid; and   The amount of each contribution and date of actual payment or, if applicable, the total amount of contributions paid to each organization during the next tax year, to be treated as paid in the prior tax year.      \\xa0   The election must be filed by the due date (including extensions) for Form 1041 for the next tax year. If the original return was filed on time, you may make the election on an amended return filed no later than 6 months after the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" at the top of the amended return and file it at the same address you used for your original return.   For more information about the charitable deduction, see section 642(c) and related regulations.    \\xa0 Specific Instructions  \\xa0    Line 1—Amounts Paid or Permanently Set Aside for Charitable Purposes From Gross Income     Enter amounts that were paid for a charitable purpose out of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s gross income, including any capital gains that are attributable to income under the governing instrument or local law. Include amounts paid during the tax year from gross income received in a prior tax year, but only if no deduction was allowed for any prior tax year for these amounts. Estates, and certain trusts, may claim a deduction for amounts permanently set aside for a charitable purpose from gross income. Such amounts must be permanently set aside during the tax year to be used exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the establishment, acquisition, maintenance, or operation of a public cemetery not operated for profit. For a trust to qualify, the trust may not be a simple trust, and the set aside amounts must be required by the terms of a trust instrument that was created on or before October 9, 1969. Further, the trust instrument must provide for an irrevocable remainder interest to be transferred to or for the use of an organization described in section 170(c); or the trust must have been created by a grantor who was at all times after October 9, 1969, under a mental disability to change the terms of the trust. Also, certain testamentary trusts that were established by a will that was executed on or before October 9, 1969, may qualify. See Regulations section 1.642(c)-2(b). Don\\'t include any capital gains for the tax year allocated to corpus and paid or permanently set aside for charitable purposes. Instead, enter these amounts on line 4.   \\xa0    Line 2—Tax-Exempt Income Allocable to Charitable Contributions    Any estate or trust that pays or sets aside any part of its income for a charitable purpose must reduce the deduction by the portion allocable to any tax-exempt income. If the governing instrument specifically provides as to the source from which amounts are paid, permanently set aside, or to be used for charitable purposes, the specific provisions control. In all other cases, determine the amount of tax-exempt income allocable to charitable contributions by multiplying line 1 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total tax-exempt income of the estate or trust, and the denominator of which is the gross income of the estate or trust. Don\\'t include in the denominator any losses allocated to corpus.   \\xa0    Line 4—Capital Gains for the Tax Year Allocated to Corpus and Paid or Permanently Set Aside for Charitable Purposes    Enter the total of all capital gains for the tax year that are:    Allocated to corpus, and   Paid or permanently set aside for charitable purposes.    \\xa0   \\xa0    Line 6—Section 1202 Exclusion Allocable to Capital Gains Paid or Permanently Set Aside for Charitable Purposes    If the exclusion of gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business (QSB) stock was claimed, enter the part of the gain included on Schedule A, lines 1 and 4, that was excluded under section 1202.     \\xa0 Schedule B—Income Distribution Deduction   \\xa0 General Instructions If the estate or trust was required to distribute income currently or if it paid, credited, or was required to distribute any other amounts to beneficiaries during the tax year, complete Schedule B to determine the estate\\'s or trust\\'s income distribution deduction.  Note. Use Schedule I (Form 1041) to compute the DNI and income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis.  \\xa0  Pooled income funds. Don\\'t complete Schedule B for these funds. Instead, attach a separate statement to support the computation of the income distribution deduction. See Pooled Income Funds, earlier, for more information.   Separate share rule.  If a single trust or an estate has more than one beneficiary, and if different beneficiaries have substantially separate and independent shares, their shares are treated as separate trusts or estates for the sole purpose of determining the DNI allocable to the respective beneficiaries.   If the separate share rule applies, figure the DNI allocable to each beneficiary on a separate sheet and attach the sheet to this return. Any deduction or loss that is applicable solely to one separate share of the trust or estate isn\\'t available to any other share of the same trust or estate.   For more information, see section 663(c) and related regulations.   Withholding of tax on foreign persons.  The fiduciary may be liable for withholding tax on distributions to beneficiaries who are foreign persons. For more information, see Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities, and Forms 1042 and 1042-S.    \\xa0 Specific Instructions  \\xa0    Line 1—Adjusted Total Income    Generally, enter on line 1, Schedule B, the amount from line 17 on page 1 of Form 1041. However, if both line 4 and line 17 on page 1 of Form 1041 are losses, enter on line 1, Schedule B, the smaller of those losses. If line 4 is zero or a gain and line 17 is a loss, enter zero on line 1, Schedule B. If you are filing for a simple trust, subtract from adjusted total income any extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends included on page 1, line 2, and determined under the governing instrument and applicable local law to be allocable to corpus.   \\xa0    Line 2—Adjusted Tax-Exempt Interest    To figure the adjusted tax-exempt interest: Step 1. Add tax-exempt interest income on line 2 of Schedule A, any expenses allowable under section 212 allocable to tax-exempt interest, and any interest expense allocable to tax-exempt interest. Step 2. Subtract the Step 1 total from the amount of tax-exempt interest (including exempt-interest dividends) received. Section 212 expenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt interest are allocated only to tax-exempt interest. A reasonable proportion of section 212 expenses that are indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt interest and other income must be allocated to each class of income. Figure the interest expense allocable to tax-exempt interest according to the guidelines in Rev. Proc. 72-18, 1972-1 C.B. 740. See Regulations sections 1.643(a)-5 and 1.265-1 for more information.   \\xa0    Line 3    Include all capital gains, whether or not distributed, that are attributable to income under the governing instrument or local law. For example, if the trustee distributed 50% of the current year\\'s capital gains to the income beneficiaries (and reflects this amount in column (1), line 19 of Schedule D (Form 1041)), but under the governing instrument all capital gains are attributable to income, then include 100% of the capital gains on line 3. If the amount on Schedule D (Form 1041), line 19, column (1), is a net loss, enter zero. If the exclusion of gain from the sale or exchange of QSB stock  was claimed, don\\'t reduce the gain on line 3 by any amount excluded under section 1202.   \\xa0    Line 5    In figuring the amount of long-term and short-term capital gain for the tax year included on Schedule A, line 1, the specific provisions of the governing instrument control if the instrument specifically provides as to the source from which amounts are paid, permanently set aside, or to be used for charitable purposes. In all other cases, determine the amount to enter by multiplying line 1 of Schedule A by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of net capital gains that are included in the accounting income of the estate or trust (that is, not allocated to corpus) and are distributed to charities, and the denominator of which is all items of income (including the amount of such net capital gains) included in the DNI. Reduce the amount on line 5 by any allocable section 1202 exclusion.   \\xa0    Line 8—Accounting Income    If you are filing for a decedent\\'s estate or a simple trust, skip this line. If you are filing for a complex trust, enter the income for the tax year determined under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law. Don\\'t include extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends determined under the governing instrument and applicable local law to be allocable to corpus.   \\xa0    Lines 9 and 10    Don\\'t include any:    Amount that was deducted on the prior year\\'s return that was required to be distributed in the prior year;   Amount that is paid or permanently set aside for charitable purposes or otherwise qualifying for the charitable deduction; or   Amount that is properly paid or credited as a gift or bequest of a specific amount of money or specific property.  Note. An amount that can be paid or credited only from income isn\\'t considered a gift or bequest. Also, to qualify as a gift or bequest, the amount must be paid in three or fewer installments.    \\xa0   \\xa0    Line 9—Income Required To Be Distributed Currently    Line 9 is to be completed by all simple trusts as well as complex trusts and decedent\\'s estates that are required to distribute income currently, whether it is distributed or not. The determination of whether trust income is required to be distributed currently depends on the terms of the governing instrument and the applicable local law. The line 9 distributions are referred to as first tier distributions and are deductible by the estate or trust to the extent of the DNI. The beneficiary includes such amounts in his or her income to the extent of his or her proportionate share of the DNI.   \\xa0    Line 10—Other Amounts Paid, Credited, or Otherwise Required To Be Distributed    Line 10 is to be completed only by a decedent\\'s estate or complex trust. These distributions consist of any other amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed and are referred to as second tier distributions. Such amounts include annuities to the extent not paid out of income, mandatory and discretionary distributions of corpus, and distributions of property in kind. If Form 1041-T was timely filed to elect to treat estimated tax payments as made by a beneficiary, the payments are treated as paid or credited to the beneficiary on the last day of the tax year and must be included on line 10. Unless a section 643(e)(3) election is made, the value of all noncash property actually paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiaries is the smaller of:    The estate\\'s or trust\\'s adjusted basis in the property immediately before distribution, plus any gain or minus any loss recognized by the estate or trust on the distribution (basis of beneficiary), or   The FMV of such property.    If a section 643(e)(3) election is made by the fiduciary, then the amount entered on line 10 will be the FMV of the property. A fiduciary of a complex trust or a decedent\\'s estate may elect to treat any amount paid or credited to a beneficiary within 65 days following the close of the tax year as being paid or credited on the last day of that tax year. To make this election, see the instructions for Other Information, Question 6, later. The beneficiary includes the amounts on line 10 in his or her income only to the extent of his or her proportionate share of the DNI.  Complex trusts. If the second tier distributions exceed the DNI allocable to the second tier, the trust may have an accumulation distribution. See the line 11 instructions below.    \\xa0    Line 11—Total Distributions    If line 11 is more than line 8, and you are filing for a complex trust that has previously accumulated income, see the instructions for Schedule J, later, to see if you must complete Schedule J (Form 1041).   \\xa0    Line 12—Adjustment for Tax-Exempt Income    In figuring the income distribution deduction, the estate or trust isn\\'t allowed a deduction for any item of the DNI that isn\\'t included in the gross income of the estate or trust. Thus, for purposes of figuring the allowable income distribution deduction, the DNI (line 7) is figured without regard to any tax-exempt interest. If tax-exempt interest is the only tax-exempt income included in the total distributions (line 11), and the DNI (line 7) is less than or equal to line 11, then enter on line 12 the amount from line 2. If tax-exempt interest is the only tax-exempt income included in the total distributions (line 11), and the DNI is more than line 11 (that is, the estate or trust made a distribution that is less than the DNI), then figure the adjustment by multiplying line 2 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total distributions (line 11), and the denominator of which is the DNI (line 7). Enter the result on line 12. If line 11 includes tax-exempt income other than tax-exempt interest, figure line 12 by subtracting the total of the following from tax-exempt income included on line 11:    The charitable contribution deduction allocable to such tax-exempt income, and   Expenses allocable to tax-exempt income.    \\xa0 Expenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt income are allocated only to tax-exempt income. A reasonable proportion of expenses indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt income and other income must be allocated to each class of income.     \\xa0 Schedule G—Tax Computation and Payments  \\xa0 Part I – Tax Computation   \\xa0 Line 1a  2019 tax rate schedule. For tax years beginning in 2019, figure the tax using the following Tax Rate Schedule and enter the tax on line 1a. However, see the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041) and the Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet, later.             2019 Tax Rate Schedule    If taxable income is:  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   Over—  But not over—  Its tax is:  Of the amount over—    $0 $2,600 10% $0   2,600 9,300 $260 + 24% 2,600   9,300 12,750 1,868 + 35% 9,300   12,750 ----- 3,075.50 + 37% 12,750   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0     \\xa0   Schedule D (Form 1041) and Schedule D Tax Worksheet.

If you don\\'t have to complete Part I or Part II of Schedule D and the estate or trust has an amount entered on line 2b(2) of Form 1041 and any taxable income (line 23), then figure the estate\\'s or trust\\'s tax using the worksheet, later, and enter the tax on line 1a.   Note. You must reduce the amount you enter on line 2b(2) of Form 1041 by the portion of the section 691(c) deduction claimed on line 19 of Form 1041 if the estate or trust received qualified dividends that were IRD.  \\xa0   Line 1c—AMT.

The estate or trust may claim credit for that part of the foreign taxes not allocable to the beneficiaries (including charitable beneficiaries). Enter the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of the credit on line 2a. See Pub. 514, Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals, for details.   \\xa0 Line 2b—General Business Credit   \\xa0 Don\\'t include any amounts that are allocated to a beneficiary. Credits that are allocated between the estate or trust and the beneficiaries are listed in the instructions for Schedule K-1, box 13, later.

Enter on line 2b the estate\\'s or trust\\'s total general business credit allowed for the current year from Form 3800. The estate or trust must file Form 3800 to claim any of the general business credits. Generally, if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s only source of a credit is from a pass-through entity and the beneficiary isn\\'t entitled to an allocable share of a credit, you aren\\'t required to complete the source form for that credit. However, certain credits have limitations and special computations that may require you to complete the source form. See the Instructions for Form 3800 for more information.   \\xa0 Line 2c—Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax An estate or trust that paid AMT in a previous year may be eligible for a minimum tax credit in 2019.

If the estate or trust disposed of investment credit property or changed its use before the end of the recapture period, see Form 4255, Recapture of Investment Credit, to figure the recapture tax allocable to the estate or trust. Include the tax on line 6 and write \"ICR\" on the dotted line to the left of the entry space.   Recapture of low-income housing credit. If the estate or trust disposed of property (or there was a reduction in the qualified basis of the property) on which the low-income housing credit was claimed, see Form 8611, Recapture of Low-Income Housing Credit, to figure any recapture tax allocable to the estate or trust. Include the tax on line 6 and write \"LIHCR\" on the dotted line to the left of the entry space.   Recapture of qualified electric vehicle credit. If the estate or trust claimed the qualified electric vehicle credit in a prior tax year for a vehicle that ceased to qualify for the credit, part or all of the credit may have to be recaptured. See Regulations section 1.30-1(b) for details. If the estate or trust owes any recapture tax, include it on line 6 and write \"QEVCR\" on the dotted line to the left of the entry space.   Recapture of the Indian employment credit. Generally, if the estate or trust terminates a qualified employee less than 1 year after the date of initial employment, any Indian employment credit allowed for a prior tax year by reason of wages paid or incurred to that employee must be recaptured.

The estate or trust paid any one household employee cash wages of $2,100 or more in 2019. Cash wages include wages paid by checks, money orders, etc. When figuring the amount of cash wages paid, combine cash wages paid by the estate or trust with cash wages paid to the household employee in the same calendar year by the household of the decedent or beneficiary for whom the administrator, executor, or trustee of the estate or trust is acting.   The estate or trust withheld federal income tax during 2019 at the request of any household employee.   The estate or trust paid total cash wages of $1,000 or more in any calendar quarter of 2018 or 2019 to household employees.    \\xa0  Note. See Amended Schedule H (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) under F. Initial Return, Amended Return, etc., earlier for information on filing an amended Schedule H (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for a Form 1041.    \\xa0 Line 8 — Other Taxes and Amounts Due  Triggering event under section 965(i). If you had a triggering event under section 965(i) during the year, enter on Line 8, Other taxes and amounts due, the current year tax liability from the triggered deferred net 965 tax liability from Form 965-A, Part IV, column (f).

Interest on deferred tax attributable to installment sales of certain timeshares and residential lots and certain nondealer real property installment obligations. If an obligation arising from the disposition of real property to which section 453(l) or 453A applies is outstanding at the close of the year, the estate or trust must include the interest due under section 453(l)(3)(B) or 453A(c), whichever is applicable, in the amount to be entered on line 8 of Schedule G, Form 1041, with the notation \"Section 453(l) interest\" or \"Section 453A(c) interest,\" whichever is applicable. Attach a schedule showing the computation.   Form 4970, Tax on Accumulation Distribution of Trusts. Include on this line any tax due on an accumulation distribution from a trust. To the left of the entry space, write \"From Form 4970\" and the amount of the tax.   Form 8697, Interest Computation Under the Look-Back Method for Completed Long-Term Contracts.

If the estate or trust fails to receive the minimum distribution under section 4974, use Form 5329 to pay the excise tax. To the left of the entry space, write \"From Form 5329\" and the amount of the tax.   Additional tax on the early disposition of noncash property for which a section 247(g)(3) election was made by an Alaska Native Settlement Trust. This additional 10% tax only should be shown on an amended return filed by a Settlement Trust for the year in which the Settlement Trust received a contribution of noncash property from an Alaska Native Corporation and elected to defer the recognition of income related to such property, but disposed of the property within the first tax year subsequent to the tax year the Settlement Trust received the property. Determine the increase in tax due to the inclusion of the deferred income and include on this line the additional tax due, equal to 10% of the increase in tax due to the inclusion of the deferred income. The increase in tax due to the inclusion of the deferred income, which is the base amount for the computation of the additional 10% tax shown on this line, should be shown elsewhere on Schedule G. If the amended return also shows changes to income, deductions, or credits unrelated to the inclusion of the deferred income, attach a schedule showing the computation of the additional tax due only to the inclusion of the deferred income. To the left of the entry space, write \"Section 247(g)(3) tax.\"     \\xa0 Part II – Payments   \\xa0 Line 10—2019 Estimated Tax Payments and Amount Applied From 2018 Return Enter the amount of any estimated tax payment you made with Form 1041-ES for 2019 plus the amount of any overpayment from the 2018 return that was applied to the 2019 estimated tax. If the estate or trust is the beneficiary of another trust and received a payment of estimated tax that was credited to the trust (as reflected on the Schedule K-1 issued to the trust), then report this amount separately with the notation \"section 643(g)\" in the space next to line 10 and include this amount in the amount entered on line 10.  \\xa0 Don\\'t include on Form 1041 estimated tax paid by an individual before death. Instead, include those payments on the decedent\\'s final income tax return.   \\xa0 Line 11—Estimated Tax Payments Allocated to Beneficiaries (from Form 1041-T) The trustee (or executor, for the final year of the estate) may elect under section 643(g) to have any portion of its estimated tax treated as a payment of estimated tax made by a beneficiary or beneficiaries. The election is made on Form 1041-T, Allocation of Estimated Tax Payments to Beneficiaries, which must be filed by the 65th day after the close of the trust\\'s tax year. Form 1041-T shows the amounts to be allocated to each beneficiary. This amount is reported on the beneficiary\\'s Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 13, code A. Attach Form 1041-T to your return only if you haven\\'t yet filed it; however, attaching Form 1041-T to Form 1041 doesn\\'t extend the due date for filing Form 1041-T. If you have already filed Form 1041-T, don\\'t attach a copy to your return.  \\xa0 Failure to file Form 1041-T by the due date (March 5, 2020, for calendar year estates and trusts) will result in an invalid election. An invalid election will require the filing of amended Schedules K-1 for each beneficiary who was allocated a payment of estimated tax.   \\xa0 Line 13—Tax Paid with Form 7004 If you filed Form 7004 to request an extension of time to file Form 1041, enter the amount that you paid with the extension request.   \\xa0 Line 14—Federal Income Tax Withheld Use line 14 to claim a credit for any federal income tax withheld (and not repaid) by: (a) an employer on wages and salaries of a decedent received by the decedent\\'s estate; (b) a payer of certain gambling winnings (for example, state lottery winnings); or (c) a payer of distributions from pensions, annuities, retirement or profit-sharing plans, IRAs, insurance contracts, etc., received by a decedent\\'s estate or trust. Attach a copy of Form W-2, Form W-2G, or Form 1099-R to the front of the return.  \\xa0 Except for backup withholding (as explained below), withheld income tax can\\'t be passed through to beneficiaries on either Schedule K-1 or Form 1041-T.  Backup withholding. If the estate or trust received a 2019 Form 1099 showing federal income tax withheld (that is, backup withholding) on interest income, dividends, or other income, check the box and include the amount withheld on income retained by the estate or trust in the total for line 14. Report on Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 13, code B, any credit for backup withholding on income distributed to the beneficiary.    \\xa0 Line 15—2019 Net 965 Tax Liability - Eligible for Installment Payment Election If you have a 2019 net 965 tax liability eligible for installment payment election, enter this amount from Form 965-A, Part I, column (f), line 3. \\xa0  Note. Include on line 15 amounts from the net 965 tax liability attributable to the S portion of an ESBT that are not deferred under section 965(i). See Schedule G, Part I, Line 4-Tax on ESBTs, earlier, for more information.  \\xa0   \\xa0 Line 16a—Credit for Tax Paid on Undistributed Capital Gains Attach Copy B of Form 2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains.   \\xa0 Line 16b—Credit for Federal Tax on Fuels Enter any credit for federal excise taxes paid on fuels that are ultimately used for nontaxable purposes (for example, an off-highway business use). Attach Form 4136, Credit for Federal Tax Paid on Fuels. See Pub. 510, Excise Taxes, for more information.    \\xa0 Net Investment Income Tax  Certain estates and trusts may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). Estates and trusts use Form 8960 to report their Net Investment Income (NII) and calculate the tax. The amount of NIIT payable by the estate or trust is reported on Form 1041, Schedule G, line 5. The NIIT is imposed on estates and trusts to the extent that they have undistributed net investment income and adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeding $12,750. See Definitions, earler, for the calculation of an estate or trust’s AGI. The following types of estates and trusts may owe the NIIT in addition to their regular income tax liability:    Decedent’s estates,   Simple and complex trusts,   Electing small business trusts (ESBTs),   Pooled income funds, and   Bankruptcy estates.    \\xa0 However, in the case of bankruptcy estates, the adjusted gross income threshold is $125,000.  Calculation of Net Investment Income. In general, an estate or trust’s NII is calculated in the same way as an individual. However, there are special rules for the calculation of NII in the case of an ESBT. See instructions to Form 8960 and Regulations section 1.1411-3(e) for information on the calculation (and Regulations section 1.1411-3(c)(1) for information on the ESBT calculation).   Distributions on Net Investment Income. The NIIT is imposed on estates and trusts to the extent it has undistributed net investment income. In order to arrive at the estate or trust’s undistributed net investment income, the estate or trust’s NII is reduced for (1) distributions of NII to beneficiaries, and (2) NII allocable to charities when the estate or trust is allowed a deduction under section 642(c). Instructions for Form 8960, line 18, provide more information on the calculation of undistributed net investment income.   NII allocable to the deduction under section 642(c). An estate, trust, or pooled income fund’s NII is reduced by the amount of NII allocable to the charitable deduction allowed under section 642(c). In the case of an estate, trust, or pooled income fund that has NII and non-NII income in a year when a section 642(c) deduction is claimed, the amount of the NII deduction allocable to the section 642(c) deduction will be less than the amount reported on Form 1041, Schedule A, line 7 (or on the separate calculation in the case of a pooled income fund).   Beneficiary reporting. In general, the amount of the income distribution deduction (from Form 1041, Schedule B, line 15) that reduces the estate or trust’s NII will be the amount of NII that will be taxable to the beneficiaries on their Schedules K-1 (Form 1041).  The Schedule K-1 has a code H in box 14 to report the amount of net investment income distributed to the beneficiary. The amount reported in code H represents an adjustment (either positive or negative) that the beneficiary must use in completing its Form 8960 (if necessary). In the case where the trust’s income distribution deduction allowed in calculating undistributed net investment income is less than the amount on Schedule B, line 15, then code H will show a negative number that is the difference between the two amounts. In the case of an estate or trust that issues more than one Schedule K-1 for a year, the sum of the amounts reported in code H on all of the Schedules K-1 will be the difference between Schedule B, line 15, and the amount deducted on Form 8960, line 18b, for amounts of NII distributed to a beneficiary.  \\xa0 The beneficiary\\'s NII will equal all taxable amounts reported on the Schedule K-1, adjusted by the amount reported in box 14, code H.  \\xa0 The only instance where code H will be a positive number is when:    The estate or trust owns directly, or indirectly, an (a) interest in a section 1291 fund, or (b) interest in a controlled foreign corporation or qualified electing fund and no election under Regulations section 1.1411–10(g) has been made with respect to that interest, and   The distribution from one of the entities described above is (a) net investment income to the estate or trust, but not included in its taxable income, and (b) the distributions from the estate or trust to the beneficiary(s) in the year exceed the amount of the income distribution deduction allowed for regular tax purposes (from Schedule B, line 15).    \\xa0   Special rules. In the final year of an estate or trust, deductions in excess of income may be reported to the beneficiary on Schedule K-1, box 11. These deductions may also be deductible by the beneficiary for NIIT purposes. In this situation, the terminating estate or trust should provide the beneficiary information regarding whether the amounts reported in box 11, codes A through D, include any amounts that are deductible for NIIT purposes. See Regulations section 1.1411-4(g)(4).     \\xa0 Other Information  \\xa0 Question 1 If the estate or trust received tax-exempt income, figure the allocation of expenses between tax-exempt and taxable income on a separate sheet and attach it to the return. Enter only the deductible amounts on the return. Don\\'t figure the allocation on the return itself. For more information, see the instructions for Allocation of Deductions for Tax-Exempt Income, earlier. Report the amount of tax-exempt interest income received or accrued in the space provided below Question 1. Also, include any exempt-interest dividends the estate or trust received as a shareholder in a mutual fund or other regulated investment company.   \\xa0 Question 2 All salaries, wages, and other compensation for personal services must be included on the return of the person who earned the income, even if the income was irrevocably assigned to a trust by a contract assignment or similar arrangement. The grantor or person creating the trust is considered the owner if he or she keeps \"beneficial enjoyment\" of or substantial control over the trust property. The trust\\'s income, deductions, and credits are allocable to the owner. If you checked \"Yes\" for Question 2, see Special Reporting Instructions, earlier.   \\xa0 Question 3 Check the \"Yes\" box and enter the name of the foreign country if either 1 or 2 below applies.    The estate or trust owns more than 50% of the stock in any corporation that owns one or more foreign bank accounts.   At any time during the year the estate or trust had an interest in or signature or other authority over a bank, securities, or other financial account in a foreign country.    \\xa0  Exception.  Check \"No\" if either of the following applies to the estate or trust:     The combined value of the accounts was $10,000 or less during the whole year, or   The accounts were with a U.S. military banking facility operated by a U.S. financial institution.    \\xa0 If you checked \"Yes\" for Question 3, electronically file FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), with the Department of the Treasury using the FinCEN\\'s BSA E-Filing Sytem. Because FinCEN Form 114 isn\\'t a tax form, don\\'t file it with Form 1041. See fincen.gov for more information.    \\xa0 If you are required to file FinCEN Form 114 but don\\'t, you may have to pay a penalty of up to $10,000 (or more in some cases).  \\xa0 Question 4 The estate or trust may be required to file Form 3520, Annual Return To Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts, if:    It directly or indirectly transferred property or money to a foreign trust. For this purpose, any U.S. person who created a foreign trust is considered a transferor;   It is treated as the owner of any part of the assets of a foreign trust under the grantor trust rules; or   It received a distribution from a foreign trust.  \\xa0 An owner of a foreign trust must ensure that the trust files an annual information return on Form 3520-A, Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a U.S. Owner.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Question 5 An estate or trust claiming an interest deduction for qualified residence interest (as defined in section 163(h)(3)) on seller-provided financing must include on an attachment to the 2019 Form 1041 the name, address, and TIN of the person to whom the interest was paid or accrued (that is, the seller). If the estate or trust received or accrued such interest, it must provide identical information on the person liable for such interest (that is, the buyer). This information doesn\\'t need to be reported if it duplicates information already reported on Form 1098.   \\xa0 Question 6 To make the section 663(b) election to treat any amount paid or credited to a beneficiary within 65 days following the close of the tax year as being paid or credited on the last day of that tax year, check the box. This election can be made by the fiduciary of a complex trust or the executor of a decedent\\'s estate. For the election to be valid, you must file Form 1041 by the due date (including extensions). Once made, the election is irrevocable.   \\xa0 Question 7 To make the section 643(e)(3) election to recognize gain on property distributed in kind, check the box and see the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041).   \\xa0 Question 9 Generally, a beneficiary is a skip person if the beneficiary is in a generation that is two or more generations below the generation of the transferor to the trust. To determine if a beneficiary that is a trust is a skip person, and for exceptions to the general rules, see the definition of a skip person in the instructions for Schedule R of Form 706.   \\xa0 Question 10 A domestic trust that is a specified domestic entity must file Form 8938 along with Form 1041 for the tax year. Form 8938 must be filed each year the value of the trust\\'s specified foreign financial assets meets or exceeds the reporting threshold. A trust exceeds the threshold amount if the total value of the specified foreign financial assets is more than $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or more than $75,000 at any time during the tax year. For more information on domestic trusts that are specified domestic entities, the filing threshold, and the types of foreign financial assets that must be reported, see the Instructions for Form 8938. A domestic trust that is required to file Form 8938 along with Form 1041 for the tax year must check \"Yes\" to Question 10 under Other Information, Form 1041.   \\xa0 Question 11a A distribution of S corporation stock by an estate or trust that results in a change of ownership for federal income tax purposes is a triggering event described in Regulations section 1.965-7(c)(3). If the estate or trust transfers less than all of its shares of stock of the S corporation, the transfer will be a triggering event only with respect to the portion of the estate’s or trust’s section 965(i) net tax liability that is properly allocable to the transferred shares. If the person who received the distribution of S corporation stock is an eligible section 965(i) transferee, the estate or trust may enter into a transfer agreement with the eligible section 965(i) transferee to prevent the assessment of the estate’s or trust’s section 965(i) net tax liability in the tax year that includes the triggering event. The estate or trust must report in Part IV, column (g) of Form 965-A, Individual Report of Net 965 Tax Liability, the transfer out of the section 965 tax liability properly allocable to S corporation shares for which the estate or trust entered into a transfer agreement with an eligible section 965(i) transferee. See the instructions for Form 965-A for additional information.  \\xa0 The transfer agreement must be filed within 30 days of the triggering event. See Form 965-D, Transfer Agreement Under 965(i)(2), and the related instructions for additional information.   \\xa0 Question 11b If the estate or trust distributed S corporation shares and the estate or trust did not enter into a timely transfer agreement for all shares transferred during the tax year, the transfer of shares not covered by a transfer agreement is a triggering event. See Triggering event under section 965(i), earlier. The estate or trust may file a consent agreement under section 965(i)(4)(D) to make the election under section 965(h) to pay in installments the triggered section 965(i) net tax liability. See Form 965-E, Consent Agreement Under Section 965(i)(4)(D), and the related instructions for how to file the consent agreement. See the instructions for Triggered deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, in Part I of the instructions for Form 965-A for how to make the installment election. See Line 25 — 2019 Net 965 Tax Liability Paid, and Schedule G, Part II, Line 15 — 2019 Net 965 Tax Liability – Eligible for Installment Payment Election, earlier, for how to report payments of the 965 tax.  \\xa0 The due date of the original Form 965-E is within 30 days of the triggering event.  \\xa0 The due date of the election to pay in installments is the due date of the return for the tax year, including extension. The actual payment of the first installment is due no later than the due date of the return for the tax year without extension, even if the election is made on a return filed by the extended due date.   \\xa0 Question 12 \\xa0  Note: Check the “Yes” box if the estate or trust entered into a transfer agreement as an eligible 965(i) transferee.  \\xa0 The estate or trust must report on Form 965-A the net 965 tax liability with respect to an S corporation, whether or not deferred. If during the tax year the estate or trust entered into a transfer agreement as an eligible 965(i) transferee, the estate or trust must report the transfer in of that liability on Part IV of Form 965-A. See the instructions for Form 965-A for additional information.   \\xa0 Question 13 If the deemed owner of a grantor portion of the ESBT is a nonresident alien, the items of income, deduction, and credit from that grantor portion must be reallocated to the S portion. See Schedule G, Part I, line 4, Tax on the ESBT Portion of the Trust, earlier for how to figure the tax on the S portion of the trust.   \\xa0 Question 14 The S portion of the ESBT must take into account the qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss and other items from any S corporation owned by the ESBT, and any qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss and other items reallocated to the S portion. See Question 13, earlier. For purposes of determining whether the taxable income of an ESBT exceeds the threshold amount, the S portion and the non-S portion of an ESBT are treated as a single trust. See Regulations section 1.199A-6(d)(3)(vi).    \\xa0 Schedule J (Form 1041) — Accumulation Distribution for Certain Complex Trusts  \\xa0 General Instructions Use Schedule J (Form 1041) to report an accumulation distribution for a domestic complex trust that was:    Previously treated at any time as a foreign trust (unless an exception is provided in future regulations), or   Created before March 1, 1984, unless that trust would not be aggregated with other trusts under the rules of section 643(f) if that section applied to the trust.    \\xa0 An accumulation distribution is the excess of amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed (other than income required to be distributed currently) over the DNI of the trust reduced by income required to be distributed currently. To have an accumulation distribution, the distribution must exceed the accounting income of the trust.   \\xa0 Specific Instructions  \\xa0    Part I—Accumulation Distribution in 2019      \\xa0    Line 1—Distribution Under Section 661(a)(2)    Enter the amount from Form 1041, Schedule B, line 10, for 2019. This is the amount properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed other than the amount of income for the current tax year required to be distributed currently.   \\xa0    Line 2—DNI    Enter the amount from Form 1041, Schedule B, line 7, for 2019. This is the amount of DNI for the current tax year determined under section 643(a).   \\xa0    Line 3—Distribution Under Section 661(a)(1)    Enter the amount from Form 1041, Schedule B, line 9, for 2019. This is the amount of income for the current tax year required to be distributed currently.   \\xa0    Line 5—Accumulation Distribution    If line 11 of Form 1041, Schedule B, is more than line 8 of Form 1041, Schedule B, complete the rest of Schedule J and file it with Form 1041, unless the trust has no previously accumulated income. Generally, amounts accumulated before a beneficiary reaches age 21 may be excluded by the beneficiary. See sections 665 and 667(c) for exceptions relating to multiple trusts. The trustee reports to the IRS the total amount of the accumulation distribution before any reduction for income accumulated before the beneficiary reaches age 21. If the multiple trust rules don\\'t apply, the beneficiary claims the exclusion when filing Form 4970, as you may not be aware that the beneficiary may be a beneficiary of other trusts with other trustees. For examples of accumulation distributions that include payments from one trust to another trust, and amounts distributed for a dependent\\'s support, see Regulations section 1.665(b)-1A(b).    \\xa0 Part II—Ordinary Income Accumulation Distribution Enter the applicable year at the top of each column for each throwback year.  \\xa0    Line 6—DNI for Earlier Years    Enter the applicable amounts as follows:          Throwback year(s) \\xa0 Amount from line   1969–1977 Form 1041, Schedule C, line 5   1978–1979 Form 1041, line 61   1980 Form 1041, line 60   1981–1982 Form 1041, line 58   1983–1996 Form 1041, Schedule B, line 9   1997–2018 Form 1041, Schedule B, line 7     \\xa0 For information about throwback years, see the instructions for line 13. For purposes of line 6, in figuring the DNI of the trust for a throwback year, subtract any estate tax deduction for IRD if the income is includible in figuring the DNI of the trust for that year.   \\xa0    Line 7—Distributions Made During Earlier Years    Enter the applicable amounts as follows:          Throwback year(s) \\xa0 Amount from line   1969–1977 Form 1041, Schedule C, line 8   1978 Form 1041, line 64   1979 Form 1041, line 65   1980 Form 1041, line 64   1981–1982 Form 1041, line 62   1983–1996 Form 1041, Schedule B, line 13   1997–2018 Form 1041, Schedule B, line 11     \\xa0   \\xa0    Line 11—Prior Accumulation Distribution Thrown Back to Any Throwback Year    Enter the amount of prior accumulation distributions thrown back to the throwback years. Don\\'t enter distributions excluded under section 663(a)(1) for gifts, bequests, etc.   \\xa0    Line 13—Throwback Years     Allocate the amount on line 5 that is an accumulation distribution to the earliest applicable year first, but don\\'t allocate more than the amount on line 12 for any throwback year. An accumulation distribution is thrown back first to the earliest preceding tax year in which there is undistributed net income (UNI). Then, it is thrown back beginning with the next earliest year to any remaining preceding tax years of the trust. The portion of the accumulation distribution allocated to the earliest preceding tax year is the amount of the UNI for that year. The portion of the accumulation distribution allocated to any remaining preceding tax year is the amount by which the accumulation distribution is larger than the total of the UNI for all earlier preceding tax years. A tax year of a trust during which the trust was a simple trust for the entire year isn\\'t a preceding tax year unless (a) during that year the trust received outside income, or (b) the trustee didn\\'t distribute all of the trust\\'s income that was required to be distributed currently for that year. In this case, UNI for that year must not be more than the greater of the outside income or income not distributed during that year. The term \"outside income\"  means amounts that are included in the DNI of the trust for that year but that aren\\'t \"income\" of the trust as defined in Regulations section 1.643(b)-1. Some examples of outside income are: (a) income taxable to the trust under section 691; (b) unrealized accounts receivable that were assigned to the trust; and (c) distributions from another trust that include the DNI or UNI of the other trust.   \\xa0    Line 16—Tax-Exempt Interest Included on Line 13    For each throwback year, divide line 15 by line 6 and multiply the result by the following:          Throwback year(s) \\xa0 Amount from line   1969–1977 Form 1041, Schedule C, line 2(a)   1978–1979 Form 1041, line 58(a)   1980 Form 1041, line 57(a)   1981–1982 Form 1041, line 55(a)   1983–2018 Form 1041, Schedule B, line 2     \\xa0    \\xa0 Part III—Taxes Imposed on Undistributed Net Income For the regular tax computation, if there is a capital gain, complete lines 18 through 25 for each throwback year.

If the accumulation distribution is allocated to more than one beneficiary, attach an additional copy of Schedule J with Part IV completed for each additional beneficiary. Give each beneficiary a copy of his or her respective Part IV information. If more than 5 throwback years are involved, use another Schedule J, completing Parts II and III for each additional throwback year. If the beneficiary is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, see section 667(e) about retaining the character of the amounts distributed to determine the amount of the U.S. withholding tax. The beneficiary uses Form 4970 to figure the tax on the distribution. The beneficiary also uses Form 4970 for the section 667(b)(6) tax adjustment if an accumulation distribution is subject to estate or generation-skipping transfer tax. This is because the trustee can\\'t be the estate or generation-skipping transfer tax return filer.    \\xa0 Schedule K-1 (Form 1041)— Beneficiary\\'s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.  \\xa0 General Instructions Use Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) to report the beneficiary\\'s share of income, deductions, and credits from a trust or a decedent\\'s estate.  Note. Section 67(g) suspends miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor for tax years 2018 through 2025. See  Notice 2018-61 for information about allowable beneficiary deductions under section 67(e) and 642(h).   \\xa0 Grantor type trusts don\\'t use Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) to report the income, deductions, or credits of the grantor (or other person treated as owner). See Grantor Type Trusts, earlier.  \\xa0    Who Must File     The fiduciary (or one of the joint fiduciaries) must file Schedule K-1. A copy of each beneficiary\\'s Schedule K-1 is attached to the Form 1041 filed with the IRS, and each beneficiary is given a copy of his or her respective Schedule K-1. One copy of each Schedule K-1 must be retained for the fiduciary\\'s records.   \\xa0    Beneficiary\\'s Identifying Number    As a payer of income, you are required to request and provide a proper identifying number for each recipient of income. Enter the beneficiary\\'s number on the respective Schedule K-1 when you file Form 1041. Individuals and business recipients are responsible for giving you their TINs upon request. You may use Form W-9 to request the beneficiary\\'s identifying number.  Penalty.  You may be charged a $50 penalty for each failure to provide a required TIN, unless reasonable cause is established for not providing it. Explain any reasonable cause in a signed affidavit and attach it to this return.   Truncating recipient\\'s identification number on beneficiary\\'s statement. The estate or trust can truncate a beneficiary’s identifying number on the Schedule K-1 the estate or trust sends to the beneficiary. Truncation isn\\'t allowed on the Schedule K-1 the estate or trust files with the IRS. Also, the estate or trust can\\'t truncate its own identification number on any form. To truncate, where allowed, replace the first five digits of the nine-digit number with asterisks (*) or Xs (for example, a SSN xxx-xx-xxxx would appear as ***-**-xxxx or XXX-XX-xxxx). For more information, see Regulations section 301.6109-4.    \\xa0    Substitute Forms     You don\\'t need IRS approval to use a substitute Schedule K-1 if it is an exact copy of the IRS schedule. The boxes must use the same numbers and titles and must be in the same order and format as on the comparable IRS Schedule K-1. The substitute schedule must include the OMB number and the 6-digit form ID code in the upper right-hand corner of the schedule. You must provide each beneficiary with the Instructions for Beneficiary Filing Form 1040 or 1040-SR or other prepared specific instructions for each item reported on the beneficiary\\'s Schedule K-1.   \\xa0    Inclusion of Amounts in Beneficiaries\\' Income     Simple trust.  The beneficiary of a simple trust must include in his or her gross income the amount of the income required to be distributed currently, whether or not distributed, or if the income required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries exceeds the DNI, his or her proportionate share of the DNI. The determination of whether trust income is required to be distributed currently depends on the terms of the trust instrument and applicable local law. See Regulations section 1.652(c)-4 for a comprehensive example.   Estates and complex trusts.  The beneficiary of a decedent\\'s estate or complex trust must include in his or her gross income the sum of:       The amount of the income required to be distributed currently, or if the income required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries exceeds the DNI (figured without taking into account the charitable deduction), his or her proportionate share of the DNI (as so figured), and   All other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed, or if the sum of the income required to be distributed currently and other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to all beneficiaries exceeds the DNI, his or her proportionate share of the excess of DNI over the income required to be distributed currently.      \\xa0   See Regulations section 1.662(c)-4 for a comprehensive example.   For complex trusts that have more than one beneficiary, and if different beneficiaries have substantially separate and independent shares, their shares are treated as separate trusts for the sole purpose of determining the amount of DNI allocable to the respective beneficiaries. A similar rule applies to treat substantially separate and independent shares of different beneficiaries of an estate as separate estates. For examples of the application of the separate share rule, see the regulations under section 663(c).   Gifts and bequests. Don\\'t include in the beneficiary\\'s income any gifts or bequests of a specific sum of money or of specific property under the terms of the governing instrument that are paid or credited in three installments or less. Amounts that can be paid or credited only from income of the estate or trust don\\'t qualify as a gift or bequest of a specific sum of money.   Past years. Don\\'t include in the beneficiary\\'s income any amounts deducted on Form 1041 for an earlier year that were credited or required to be distributed in that earlier year.   Character of income. The beneficiary\\'s income is considered to have the same proportion of each class of items entering into the computation of DNI that the total of each class has to the DNI (for example, half dividends and half interest if the income of the estate or trust is half dividends and half interest).   \\xa0 Allocation of deductions. Generally, items of deduction that enter into the computation of DNI are allocated among the items of income to the extent such allocation isn\\'t inconsistent with the rules set out in section 469 and its regulations, relating to passive activity loss limitations, in the following order. First, all deductions directly attributable to a specific class of income are deducted from that income. For example, rental expenses, to the extent allowable, are deducted from rental income. Second, deductions that aren\\'t directly attributable to a specific class of income generally may be allocated to any class of income, as long as a reasonable portion is allocated to any tax-exempt income. Deductions considered not directly attributable to a specific class of income under this rule include fiduciary fees, and state income and personal property taxes. The charitable deduction, however, must be ratably apportioned among each class of income included in DNI. Finally, any excess deductions that are directly attributable to a class of income may be allocated to another class of income. However, in no case can excess deductions from a passive activity be allocated to income from a nonpassive activity, or to portfolio income earned by the estate or trust. Excess deductions attributable to tax-exempt income can\\'t offset any other class of income. In no case can deductions be allocated to an item of income that isn\\'t included in the computation of DNI, or attributable to corpus. You can\\'t show any negative amounts for any class of income shown in boxes 1 through 8 of Schedule K-1. However, for the final year of the estate or trust, certain deductions or losses can be passed through to the beneficiary(ies). See the instructions for box 11 for more information on these deductions and losses. Also, the beneficiary\\'s share of depreciation and depletion is apportioned separately. These deductions may be allocated to the beneficiary(ies) in amounts greater than his or her income. See Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization, earlier, and Rev. Rul. 74-530, 1974-2 C.B. 188.    \\xa0    Beneficiary\\'s Tax Year     The beneficiary\\'s income from the estate or trust must be included in the beneficiary\\'s tax year during which the tax year of the estate or trust ends. See Pub. 559 for more information, including the effect of the death of a beneficiary during the tax year of the estate or trust.    \\xa0 General Reporting Information If the return is for a fiscal year or a short tax year, fill in the tax year space at the top of each Schedule K-1. On each Schedule K-1, enter the information about the estate or trust and the beneficiary in Parts I and II (items A through H). In Part III, enter the beneficiary\\'s share of each item of income, deduction, credit, and any other information the beneficiary needs to file his or her income tax return.  Codes. In box 9 and boxes 11 through 14, identify each item by entering a code in the column to the left of the entry space for the dollar amount. These codes are identified in these instructions and on the back of the Schedule K-1.   Attached statements. Enter an asterisk (*) after the code, if any, in the column to the left of the dollar amount entry space for each item for which you have attached a statement providing additional information. For those informational items that can\\'t be reported as a single dollar amount, enter the code and asterisk in the left-hand column and enter \"STMT\" in the entry space to the right to indicate that the information is provided on an attached statement. More than one attached statement can be placed on the same sheet of paper and should be identified in alphanumeric order by box number followed by the letter code (if any). For example: \"Box 9, Code A—Depreciation\" (followed by the information the beneficiary needs).   Too few entry spaces on Schedule K-1? If the estate or trust has more coded items than the number of spaces in box 9 or boxes 11 through 14, don\\'t enter a code or dollar amount in the last entry space of the box. In the last entry space, enter an asterisk in the left column and enter \"STMT\" in the entry space to the right. Report the additional items on an attached statement and provide the box number, code, description, and dollar amount or information for each additional item. For example: \"Box 13, Code H—Biofuel Producer Credit, $500.00.\"     \\xa0 Specific Instructions   \\xa0 Part I. Information About the Estate or Trust On each Schedule K-1, enter the name, address, and identifying number of the estate or trust. Also, enter the name and address of the fiduciary.  \\xa0    Item D    If the fiduciary of a trust or decedent\\'s estate filed Form 1041-T, you must check this box and enter the date it was filed.   \\xa0    Item E    If this is the final year of the estate or trust, you must check this box.  Note. If this is the final K-1 for the beneficiary, check the \"Final K-1\" box at the top of Schedule K-1.     \\xa0 Part II. Information About the Beneficiary Complete a Schedule K-1 for each beneficiary. On each Schedule K-1, enter the beneficiary\\'s name, address, and identifying number.  \\xa0    Item H    Check the foreign beneficiary box if the beneficiary is a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, or a foreign estate or trust. Otherwise, check the domestic beneficiary box.    \\xa0 Part III. Beneficiary\\'s Share of Current Year Income, Deductions, Credits, and Other Items  \\xa0    Box 1—Interest    Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the taxable interest income minus allocable deductions.   \\xa0    Box 2a—Total Ordinary Dividends    Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of ordinary dividends minus allocable deductions.   \\xa0    Box 2b—Total Qualified Dividends    Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of qualified dividends minus allocable deductions.   \\xa0    Box 3—Net Short-Term Capital Gain    Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the net short-term capital gain from Schedule D (Form 1041), line 17, column (1), minus allocable deductions. Don\\'t enter a loss in box 3. If, for the final year of the estate or trust, there is a capital loss carryover, enter in box 11, code B, the beneficiary\\'s share of short-term capital loss carryover. However, if the beneficiary is a corporation, enter in box 11, code B, the beneficiary\\'s share of all short- and long-term capital loss carryovers as a single item. See section 642(h) and related regulations for more information.   \\xa0    Boxes 4a through 4c—Net Long-Term Capital Gain    Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the net long-term capital gain from Schedule D (Form 1041), lines 18a through 18c, column (1), minus allocable deductions. Don\\'t enter a loss in boxes 4a through 4c. If, for the final year of the estate or trust, there is a capital loss carryover, enter in box 11, code C, the beneficiary\\'s share of the long-term capital loss carryover. (If the beneficiary is a corporation, see the instructions for box 3.) See section 642(h) and related regulations for more information. Gains or losses from the complete or partial disposition of a rental, rental real estate, or trade or business activity that is a passive activity must be shown on an attachment to Schedule K-1.   \\xa0    Box 5—Other Portfolio and Nonbusiness Income    Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of annuities, royalties, or any other income, minus allocable deductions (other than directly apportionable deductions), that isn\\'t subject to any passive activity loss limitation rules at the beneficiary level. Use boxes 6 through 8 to report income items subject to the passive activity rules at the beneficiary\\'s level.   \\xa0    Boxes 6 through 8—Ordinary Business Income, Rental Real Estate, and Other Rental Income    Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of trade or business, rental real estate, and other rental income, minus allocable deductions (other than directly apportionable deductions). To assist the beneficiary in figuring any applicable passive activity loss limitations, also attach a separate schedule showing the beneficiary\\'s share of income derived from each trade or business, rental real estate, and other rental activity.   \\xa0    Box 9—Directly Apportioned Deductions     \\xa0 The limitations on passive activity losses and credits under section 469 apply to estates and trusts. Estates and trusts that distribute income to beneficiaries are allowed to apportion depreciation, depletion, and amortization deductions to the beneficiaries. These deductions are referred to as \"directly apportionable deductions.\"  \\xa0 Rules for treating a beneficiary\\'s income and directly apportionable deductions from an estate or trust and other rules for applying the passive loss and credit limitations to beneficiaries of estates and trusts haven\\'t yet been issued.  \\xa0 Any directly apportionable deduction, such as depreciation, is treated by the beneficiary as having been incurred in the same activity as incurred by the estate or trust. However, the character of such deduction may be determined as if the beneficiary incurred the deduction directly.   \\xa0 To assist the beneficiary in figuring any applicable passive activity loss limitations, also attach a separate schedule showing the beneficiary\\'s share of directly apportionable deductions derived from each trade or business, rental real estate, and other rental activity.   \\xa0 Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of directly apportioned deductions using codes A through C.    Depreciation (code A). Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the depreciation deductions directly apportioned to each activity reported in boxes 5 through 8. See the instructions under Deductions, earlier, for a discussion of how the depreciation deduction is apportioned between the beneficiaries and the estate or trust. Report any AMT adjustment or tax preference item attributable to depreciation separately in box 12, using code G.   Note. An estate or trust can\\'t make an election under section 179 to expense certain depreciable business assets.  \\xa0   Depletion (code B). Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the depletion deduction under section 611 directly apportioned to each activity reported in boxes 5 through 8. See Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization, earlier, for a discussion of how the depletion deduction is apportioned between the beneficiaries and the estate or trust. Report any tax preference item attributable to depletion separately in box 12, using code H.   Amortization (code C). Itemize the beneficiary\\'s share of the amortization deductions directly apportioned to each activity reported in boxes 5 through 8. Apportion the amortization deductions between the estate or trust and the beneficiaries in the same way that the depreciation and depletion deductions are divided. Report any AMT adjustment attributable to amortization separately in box 12, using code I.   \\xa0    Box 10—Estate Tax Deduction (Including Certain Generation-Skipping Transfer Taxes)    If the distribution deduction consists of any IRD, and the estate or trust was allowed a deduction under section 691(c) for the estate tax paid attributable to such income (see the line 19 instructions), then the beneficiary is allowed an estate tax deduction in proportion to his or her share of the distribution that consists of such income. For an example of the computation, see Regulations section 1.691(c)-2. Figure the computation on a separate sheet and attach it to the return.   \\xa0    Box 11, Code A—Excess Deductions on Termination    If this is the final return of the estate or trust, and there are excess deductions on termination (see the instructions for line 23), enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the excess deductions in box 11, using code A. Figure the deductions on a separate sheet and attach it to the return. Excess deductions on termination occur only during the last tax year of the trust or decedent\\'s estate when the total deductions (excluding the charitable deduction and exemption) are greater than the gross income during that tax year. Generally, a deduction based on an NOL carryover isn\\'t available to a beneficiary as an excess deduction. However, if the last tax year of the estate or trust is also the last year in which an NOL carryover may be taken (see section 172(b)), the NOL carryover is considered an excess deduction on the termination of the estate or trust to the extent it isn\\'t absorbed by the estate or trust during its final tax year. For more information, see Regulations section 1.642(h)-4 for a discussion of the allocation of the carryover among the beneficiaries. Only the beneficiary of an estate or trust that succeeds to its property is allowed to deduct that entity\\'s excess deductions on termination. A beneficiary who doesn\\'t have enough income in that year to absorb the entire deduction can\\'t carry the balance over to any succeeding year. An individual beneficiary must be able to itemize deductions in order to claim the excess deductions in determining taxable income.   \\xa0    Box 11, Codes B and C—Unused Capital Loss Carryover    Upon termination of the trust or decedent\\'s estate, the beneficiary succeeding to the property is allowed as a deduction any unused capital loss carryover under section 1212. If the estate or trust incurs capital losses in the final year, use the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041) to figure the amount of capital loss carryover to be allocated to the beneficiary.   \\xa0    Box 11, Codes D and E—NOL Carryover    Upon termination of a trust or decedent\\'s estate, a beneficiary succeeding to its property is allowed to deduct any unused NOL (and any ATNOL) carryover for regular and AMT purposes if the carryover would be allowable to the estate or trust in a later tax year but for the termination. Enter in box 11, using codes D and E, the unused carryover amounts.   \\xa0    Box 12—AMT Items      Adjustment for minimum tax purposes (code A). Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the adjustment for minimum tax purposes. To figure the adjustment, subtract the beneficiary\\'s share of the income distribution deduction figured on Schedule B, line 15, from the beneficiary\\'s share of the income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis figured on Schedule I (Form 1041), line 42. The difference is the beneficiary\\'s share of the adjustment for minimum tax purposes.   Note. Schedule B, line 15 equals the sum of all Schedules K-1, boxes 1, 2a, 3, 4a, 5, 6, 7, and 8.   AMT adjustment attributable to qualified dividends, net short-term capital gains, or net long-term capital gains (codes B through D). If any part of the amount reported in box 12, code A, is attributable to qualified dividends (code B), net short-term capital gain (code C), or net long-term capital gain (code D), enter that part using the applicable code.   AMT adjustment attributable to unrecaptured section 1250 gain or 28% rate gain (codes E and F). Enter the beneficiary\\'s distributive share of any AMT adjustments to the unrecaptured section 1250 gain (code E) or 28% rate gain (code F), whichever is applicable, in box 12.   Accelerated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (codes G through I). Enter any adjustments or tax preference items attributable to depreciation, depletion, or amortization that were directly apportioned to the beneficiary. For property placed in service before 1987, report separately the accelerated depreciation of real and leased personal property.   Exclusion items (code J). Enter the beneficiary\\'s share of the adjustment for minimum tax purposes from Schedule K-1, box 12, code A, that is attributable to exclusion items (Schedule I (Form 1041), lines 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7).   \\xa0    Box 13—Credits and Credit Recapture    Enter each beneficiary\\'s share of the credits and credit recapture using the applicable codes. Listed below are the credits that can be allocated to the beneficiary(ies). Attach a statement if additional information must be provided to the beneficiary as explained below. \\xa0    Credit for estimated taxes (code A). Payment of estimated tax to be credited to the beneficiary (section 643(g)).  \\xa0 See the instructions for Schedule G, Part II, line 11 before you make an entry to allocate any estimated tax payments to a beneficiary.

See Net Investment Income Tax, earlier, for more information on these amounts.   Section 199A information (code I). In the case of a trust or estate, the qualified business income (QBI) deduction, also known as the section 199A deduction, is determined at the beneficiary level for the portions of QBI, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership items apportioned to the beneficiaries. To allow beneficiaries to correctly figure their QBI deduction, the trust or estate must enter an asterisk (*) on each beneficiary’s Schedule K-1 next to code I and enter “STMT” in the right column to indicate that the information is provided on an attached statement. Do not add amounts into a single number and report it on Schedule K-1. The information must be separately identified for each trade or business the trust or estate directly conducts, including specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs). The trust or estate must attach the statement to each Schedule K-1, separately identifying the beneficiary’s allocable share of:    Qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss;   W-2 wages;   Unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property;   Qualified PTP items; and    Section 199A dividends, also known as qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends.      The trust or estate must make an initial determination of which items are qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss at its level and report to each beneficiary their share of all items that may be qualified items at the beneficiary level. See the heading Determining the Trust or Estate’s QBI or Qualified PTP Income, below. The beneficiary must then determine whether each item is includible in QBI.  In addition, the trust or estate must also report on whether any of its trades or businesses are SSTBs and identify on the statement any trades or businesses that are aggregated.  Trusts and estates should use Statement A—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting, in these instructions, or a substantially similar statement, to report each beneficiary’s allocable information from each trade or business, including QBI items, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified PTP items, and section 199A dividends by attaching the completed statement(s) to each beneficiary’s Schedule K-1. The trust or estate should also use Statement A—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting to report each beneficiary’s share of QBI items, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified PTP items, and section 199A dividends reported to the trust or estate by another entity.  Note. The estate or trust must report each beneficiary\\'s share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction and loss from a PTP. The PTP component is not limited by the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property limitations. Therefore, neither the PTP nor its owners (including estates and trusts) is required to report W-2 wages or UBIA of qualified property amounts related to a trade or business operated by a PTP.    Trusts and estates should use Statement B—QBI Pass-through Entity Aggregation Election(s), in these instructions, or a substantially similar statement, to report aggregated trades or businesses and provide supporting information to beneficiaries on each Schedule K-1.  Trusts and estates should use Statement C—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting- Patrons of Specified Agricultural and Horticultural Cooperatives, in these instructions, or a substantially similar statement, to report allocable QBI and W-2 wages allocable to qualified payments from a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative for each trade or business. This statement should also be used to report each beneficiary’s allocable section 199A(g) deduction reported to the trust or estate by the specified cooperative.    \\xa0 Determining the trust or estate’s qualified trades or businesses. The trust or estate’s qualified trades or businesses include its section 162 trades or businesses, except for specified service trades or businesses, or the trade or business of providing services as an employee. A section 162 trade or business generally includes any activity carried on to make a profit and with considerable, regular, and continuous activity. For more information on what qualifies as a trade or business for purposes of section 199A, see the Instructions for Form 8995, Qualified Business Income Deduction Simplified Computation, or Form 8995-A, Qualified Business Income Deduction.   \\xa0 Rental real estate. Rental real estate may constitute a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction if the rental real estate:    Rises to the level of a trade or business under section 162,   Satisfies the requirements for the rental real estate safe harbor in Rev. Proc. 2019-38, 2019-42 I.R.B. 942, or   Meets the self-rental exception (that is, the rental or licensing of property to a commonly controlled trade or business conducted by an individual or relevant passthrough entity (RPE)) in Regulations section 1.199A-1(b)(14).      The determination of whether rental real estate constitutes a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction is made by the trust or estate. The trust or estate must first make this determination and then only include the allocable share of rental real estate items of income, gain, loss, and deduction on the statement provided to beneficiaries. Rental real estate that does not meet one of the three conditions noted above does not constitute a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction and must not be included in the QBI information provided to beneficiaries.   \\xa0 Specified service trades or businesses excluded from qualified trades or businesses. SSTBs are generally excluded from the definition of a qualified trade or business. An SSTB is any trade or business providing services in the fields of health, law, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, investing and investment management, trading or dealing in securities, trust or estate interests, or commodities or any other trade or business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners. The term any trade or business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners means any trade or business that consists of any of the following: (i) a trade or business in which a person receives fees, compensation, or other income for endorsing products or services; (ii) a trade or business in which a person licenses or receives fees, compensation, or other income for the use of an individual’s image, likeness, name, signature, voice, trademark, or any other symbols associated with the individual’s identity; or (iii) receiving fees, compensation, or other income for appearing at an event or on radio, television, or another media format.   \\xa0 Exception. If the beneficiary’s taxable income is equal to or less than the threshold for the reporting 2019 tax year, $160,700 ($321,400 if married filing jointly or $160,725 if married filing separately or married nonresident alien), the QBI from the SSTB may be used by the beneficiary to compute their QBI deduction. If the beneficiary’s taxable income is within the phase-in range, the threshold amount plus $50,000 ($100,000 if married filing jointly), an applicable percentage of the QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property from an SSTB may be used by the beneficiary to compute their QBI deduction. Therefore, the statement attached to the Schedule K-1 issued to each beneficiary must identify any items relating to SSTBs.   \\xa0 Aggregation. A trust or estate engaged in more than one trade or business may choose to aggregate multiple trades or businesses into a single trade or business for purposes of section 199A if it meets the following requirements.    The same person, or group of persons, either directly or through attribution, owns 50% or more of each trade or business for a majority of the tax year, including the last day of the tax year, and all trades or businesses use the same tax year-end;   None of the trades or businesses are an SSTB; and   The trades or businesses to be aggregated meet at least two of the following three factors:    They provide products, property, or services that are the same or that are customarily offered together;   They share facilities or share significant centralized business elements, such as personnel, accounting, legal, manufacturing, purchasing, human resources, or information technology resources; or   They are operated in coordination with, or reliance upon, one or more of the businesses in the aggregated group.         If the trust or estate chooses to aggregate multiple trades or businesses, it must report the aggregation on Statement B, or a substantially similar statement, and attach it to each Schedule K-1. The statement must provide the information necessary to identify each separate trade or business included in each aggregation, a description of the aggregated trades or businesses, and an explanation of the factors met that allow the aggregation in accordance with Regulations section 1.199A-4. The aggregation statement must be completed each year to show the trust or estate\\'s trade or business aggregations. Failure to disclose the aggregations may cause them to be disaggregated.  The trust or estate\\'s aggregations must be reported consistently for all subsequent years, unless there is a change in facts and circumstances that changes or disqualifies the aggregation. The trust or estate must provide a written explanation for any changes to prior year aggregations that describes the change in facts and circumstances.  If the trust or estate directly or indirectly owns an interest in a relevant RPE that aggregates multiple trades or businesses, it must attach a copy of the RPE’s aggregation to each Schedule K-1. The trust or estate cannot break apart the aggregation of another RPE, but it may add trades or businesses to the aggregation, assuming the requirements above are satisfied.   \\xa0 Determining the Trust or Estate’s QBI or Qualified PTP Items. The trust or estate’s items of QBI that must be reported to beneficiaries include the allocated amounts of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from the trust or estate’s trades or businesses that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. This may include, but is not limited to, items such as ordinary business income or (losses), section 1231 gains or (losses), charitable contributions, section 179 deductions, and interest from debt financed distributions.  QBI may also include rental income (losses) or royalty income, if the activity rises to the level of a trade or business; and gambling gains or (losses), but only if the trust or estate is engaged in the trade or business of gambling. Whether an activity rises to the level of a trade or business must be determined at the entity level and, once made, is binding on beneficiaries.  Qualified PTP items that must be reported to the beneficiaries include the allocated amounts of the trust or estate’s share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a PTP and may also include gain or loss recognized on the disposition of the trust or estate’s partnership interest that is not treated as a capital gain or loss.  However, QBI and qualified PTP items don’t include any of the following.    Items that are treated as capital gain or loss under any provision of the Code.   Dividends or dividend equivalents, including qualified REIT dividends.   Interest income (unless received in connection with the trade or business).   Wage income.   Income that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (for more information, go to IRS.gov and type in the key word “effectively connected income”).   Commodities transactions, or foreign currency gains or losses described in section 954(c)(1)(C) or (D).   Income, loss, or deductions from notional principal contracts under section 954(c)(1)(F).   Annuities (unless received in connection with the trade or business).   Guaranteed payments described in section 707(c) received by the entity for services rendered to a partnership.   Payments described in section 707(a) received by the entity for services rendered to a partnership.    .   \\xa0 QBI flowchart. Trusts or estates may use the flow chart below to help them determine if an allocated item of income, gain, deduction, or loss is includible in QBI reportable to beneficiaries. \\xa0  QBI Flowchart          Questions Yes No   Is the item effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States?

Continue   Is the item of income or loss from a qualified publicly traded partnership? This item is a qualified PTP item. Report this item as qualified PTP income or loss, subject to beneficiary-specific determinations, and check the PTP box. This item is QBI. Report this item as QBI subject to beneficiary-specific determinations.      \\xa0   Specific Instructions for Statement A—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting. \\xa0   \\xa0 QBI or qualified PTP items. The trust or estate must first determine if it is engaged in one or more trades or businesses. It must then determine if any of its trades or businesses are SSTBs. The trust or estate must also determine whether it has qualified PTP items from an interest in a PTP. The trust or estate must indicate the status on the appropriate check boxes for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) or PTP interest reported.  Note. SSTBs and PTPs cannot be aggregated with any other trade or business. So, if the aggregation box is checked, the SSTB and PTP boxes for that specific aggregated trade or business should not be checked.    Next, the trust or estate must report to each beneficiary their allocable share of all apportioned items that are QBI or qualified PTP items for each trade or business the trust or estate owns directly or indirectly. Use the QBI Flow Chart above to determine if an allocated item is reportable as a QBI item or qualified PTP item subject to beneficiary-specific determinations. Each item included under “Other” must be stated separately, identifying the nature and amount of each item.   \\xa0 W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property. The trust or estate must determine the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property properly allocable to QBI for each qualified trade or business and report the allocable share to each beneficiary on Statement A, or a substantially similar statement, attached to Schedule K-1. This includes the allocable share of W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property reported to the trust or estate from any qualified trades or businesses of an RPE the trust or estate owns directly or indirectly. However, trusts or estates that own a direct or indirect interest in a PTP may not include any amounts for W-2 wages or UBIA of qualified property from the PTP, as the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property from a PTP are not allowed in computing the W-2 wage and UBIA limitations.  The W-2 wages are amounts paid to employees described in section 6051(a)(3) and (8). If the trust or estate conducts more than one trade or businesses, it must allocate the W-2 wages among its trades or businesses. See Rev. Proc. 2019-11, 2019-09 I.R.B. 742 or more information.  The unadjusted basis of qualified property is figured by adding the unadjusted basis of all qualified assets immediately after acquisition. Qualified property includes all tangible property subject to depreciation under section 167 for which the depreciable period hasn\\'t ended that is held and used for the production of QBI by the trade or business during the tax year and held on the last day of the tax year. The depreciable period ends on the later of 10 years after the property is placed in service or the last day of the full year for the applicable recovery period under section 168.   \\xa0 Section 199A dividends. The trust or estate must report the apportioned allocable share of any REIT dividends to each beneficiary on Statement A, or a substantially similar statement, attached to Schedule K-1. Section 199A dividends do not have to be reported by trade or business and can be reported as a single amount to beneficiaries. Section 199A dividends include dividends the trust or estate receives from a REIT held for more than 45 days, for which the payment is not obligated to someone else, is not a capital gain dividend under section 857(b)(3) and is not a qualified dividend under section 1(h)(11), plus any apportioned qualified REIT dividends received from a regulated investment company (RIC).   \\xa0 Fiscal year trusts and estates. For purposes of determining the QBI or qualified PTP items, UBIA of qualified property, and the aggregate amount of qualified section 199A dividends, fiscal year trusts or estates include all items from the fiscal tax year.  For purposes of determining W-2 wages, fiscal year trusts or estates include apportioned amounts paid to employees under section 6051(a)(3) and (8) for the calendar year ended with or within the trust or estate’s tax year. If the trust or estate conducts more than one trade or business, it must allocate W-2 wages among its trades or businesses. See Rev. Proc. 2019-11 for more information. \\xa0  Note. The trust or estate must report each beneficiary’s share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction and loss from a PTP, but the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property from the PTP should not be reported as the beneficiary cannot use that information in computing their QBI deduction.  \\xa0 \\xa0  Statement A—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting             Pass-through entity’s name: Pass-through entity’s EIN:   Beneficiary’s name: Benificiary’s identifying number:   Beneficiary\\'s Share of: ❑ PTP \\t\\t\\t❑ Aggregated \\t\\t\\t❑ SSTB ❑ PTP \\t\\t\\t❑ Aggregated \\t\\t\\t❑ SSTB ❑ PTP \\t\\t\\t❑ Aggregated \\t\\t\\t❑ SSTB   QBI or Qualified PTP Items Subject to Beneficiary-specific Determinations TB1 TB2 TB3   \\xa0 Ordinary business income \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   Rental income \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   Other \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   W-2 Wages \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   UBIA of Qualified Property \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0   Section 199A Dividends \\xa0 \\xa0      \\xa0   Specific Instructions for Statement B—QBI Pass-through Entity Aggregation Election(s). If the trust or estate elects to aggregate more than one trade or business that meet all the requirements to aggregate, the trust or estate must report the aggregation to beneficiaries on Statement B, or a substantially similar statement, and attach it to each Schedule K-1. The trust or estate must indicate trades or businesses that were aggregated by checking the appropriate box for each aggregated trade or business. The trust or estate must also provide a description of the aggregated trade or business and an explanation of the factors met that allow the aggregation.  The aggregation statement must be completed each year to show the trust’s or estate’s trade or business aggregations. Failure to disclose the aggregations may cause them to be disaggregated. The trust’s or estate’s aggregations must be reported consistently for all subsequent years, unless there is a change in facts and circumstances that changes or disqualifies the aggregation. The trust or estate must provide a written explanation for any changes to prior year aggregations that describes the change in facts and circumstances.  If the trust or estate holds a direct or indirect interest in an RPE that aggregates multiple trades or businesses, the trust or estate must also include a copy of the RPE’s aggregations with each beneficiary’s Schedule K-1. The trust or estate cannot break apart the aggregation of another RPE, but it may add trades or businesses to the aggregation, assuming the aggregation requirements are satisfied. \\xa0  Statement B—QBI Pass-through Entity Aggregation Election(s)           Pass-through entity’s name:  Pass-through entity’s EIN:     Aggregation of Pass-through Business Operations     Aggregation 1    \\xa0 Provide a description of the aggregated trades or businesses and an explanation of the factors met that allow the aggregation in accordance with Regulations section 1.199A-4.

Name the additional aggregations 2, 3, 4, and so forth.       \\xa0   Specific Instructions for Statement C—QBI Pass-through Entity Reporting - Patrons of Specified Agricultural and Horticultural Cooperatives. \\xa0   \\xa0 QBI items and wages allocable to qualified payments. If the trust or estate is a patron of a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative, the trust or estate must provide the allocable share of QBI items and W-2 wages allocable to qualified payments from each trade or business to each of its beneficiaries on Statement C, or a substantially similar statement, and attach it to Schedules K-1 so each beneficiary can compute their patron reduction under section 199A(b)(7).  QBI items and W-2 wages allocable to qualified payments include apportioned QBI items included on Statement A that are allocable to the qualified payments reported to the trust or estate on Form 1099-PATR from the cooperative.   \\xa0 Section 199A(g) Deduction. The trust or estate must report to its beneficiaries their allocable share of any apportioned section 199A(g) deduction passed-through the cooperative, as reported on Form 1099-PATR.

List on a separate sheet the tax information the beneficiary will need to complete his or her return that isn\\'t entered elsewhere on Schedule K-1. For example, if the estate or trust participates in a transaction that must be disclosed on Form 8886 (see earlier), both the estate or trust and its beneficiaries may be required to file Form 8886. The estate or trust must determine if any of its beneficiaries are required to disclose the transaction and provide those beneficiaries with information they will need to file Form 8886. This determination is based on the category(ies) under which a transaction qualified for disclosure. See the Instructions for Form 8886 for details. In addition, if the beneficiary is a \"covered person\" in connection with a foreign tax credit splitter arrangement under section 909, attach a statement that identifies the arrangement including the foreign taxes paid or accrued.   Section 199 Domestic production activities deduction (DPAD). If the estate or trust is a recipient of the DPAD from a pass-through entity (partnership, S corporation, estate, trust, or cooperative) with a tax year beginning before 2018, the DPAD can be taken in limited circumstances. See Form 8903 and its instructions for details.   Inclusion of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). Section 951A requires U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations to report their ratable share of GILTI in taxable income. If applicable, provide the information necessary to figure the GILTI inclusion to each beneficiary. See the Instructions for Form 8992 for details.  \\xa0 Foreign-derived intangible income (FDII). Public Law 115-97 enacted section 250, which allows a domestic corporation a deduction for the eligible percentage of FDII and GILTI. Section 250 is effective for tax years beginning after 2017. If applicable, provide the necessary information to each domestic corporate beneficiary for its calculation of FDII benefit. See section 250 for more information. See the Instructions for Form 8993 for details.    Limitation on business interest expense. If an estate or trust is required to file Form 8990, the adjusted taxable income of an estate or trust beneficiary is reduced by any income (including any distributable net income) received from the estate or trust by the beneficiary to the extent such income supported a deduction for business interest expense under section 163(j)(1)(B) in computing the estate\\'s or trust\\'s taxable income. If applicable, provide the beneficiary the necessary information to calculate this amount in an attachment to Schedule K-1.

       " '   Instructions for Form 1041-N (12/2019)  U.S. Income Tax Return for Electing Alaska Native Settlement Trusts    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 12/2019        Instructions for Form 1041-N - Introductory Material       Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 1041-N and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to  IRS.gov/Form1041N.      General Instructions   Use this revision for tax years beginning after 2017.  \\xa0 Purpose of Form Under section 646, an ANST may elect to apply special income tax treatment to the trust and its beneficiaries. This one-time election is made by filing Form 1041-N in the first tax year of the trust. Form 1041-N is used to report an ANST\\'s income, deductions, gains, losses, etc., and to figure and pay any income tax due. Form 1041-N is also used to report special information applicable to an ANST\\'s filing requirements.   \\xa0 Definitions An ANST is a settlement trust within the meaning of section 3(t) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). An Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) has the same meaning as the term \"Native Corporation\" has under section 3(m) of the ANCSA. A sponsoring ANC means the ANC that transfers assets to an electing ANST. A trustee is a fiduciary of the trust. Any reference in these instructions to \"you\" means the trustee of the trust.   \\xa0 Tax Treatment of an Electing ANST  \\xa0 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)  Figure the AGI of an electing ANST by subtracting from total income (line 5) administrative costs (lines 7 through 9) and the exemption amount (line 11). Administrative costs are deductible to the extent they would not have been incurred if the property were not held by the ANST.  \\xa0 Taxable Income In general, an electing ANST\\'s taxable income is figured in the same manner as any other taxable trust (see Internal Revenue Code subchapter J). However, the electing ANST isn\\'t allowed to take an income distribution deduction, though it can claim an exemption deduction, the amount of which depends on the terms of the trust. See the Schedule K instructions for information on the beneficiaries\\' tax treatment of distributions received from the ANST.   \\xa0 Income Assignment From a Native Corporation  The ANST reports income assignments from an ANC on the appropriate income line consistent with the type of income assigned to the ANST. See Part III—Other Information, Question 1, later, for the information required to be attached to the form.  \\xa0 Tax An electing ANST pays tax on its taxable income at the lowest rate specified for single individuals (10%). If the ANST has net capital gain or qualified dividends, use the tax computation on Part IV of Schedule D, which applies a 0% rate on its adjusted net capital gain.   \\xa0 Disqualifying Acts If, at any time, a beneficial interest in an ANST may be disposed of to a person in a manner that isn\\'t permitted by section 7(h) of the ANCSA (if the interest were settlement common stock), then:    If no election has previously been made, the ANST can\\'t elect special tax treatment under section 646 for the trust and its beneficiaries; or   If the election is in effect at that time:    The election won\\'t apply as of the first day of the tax year in which a prohibited disposition is first allowed;   The section 646 tax treatment won\\'t apply to the trust for that tax year or in any subsequent tax years; and   The distributable net income of the trust will be increased by the current or accumulated earnings and profits of the sponsoring ANC as of the close of the tax year, after adjustment is made for all distributions made by the sponsoring ANC during the tax year. However, this increase is limited to the fair market value (FMV) of the trust\\'s assets as of the date the beneficial interest of the trust first becomes disposable.       \\xa0 If stock in the sponsoring ANC may be disposed of to a person in a manner that isn\\'t allowed by section 7(h) of the ANCSA (if the stock were settlement common stock) and at any time after such disposition of stock is first allowed, the corporation transfers assets to an ANST, then items 1, 2, and 3 above will apply to the ANST in the same manner as if the ANST allowed dispositions of beneficial interests in the ANST in a manner not allowed by section 7(h) of the ANCSA. The surrender of an interest in an ANC or an electing ANST by the shareholder or beneficiary, for a whole or partial redemption or for the whole or partial liquidation of the corporation or trust, will be considered a transfer allowed by section 7(h) of the ANCSA.    \\xa0 Information Reporting Requirements Electing ANSTs must complete Schedule K and file it with Form 1041-N. The ANST must also provide a copy of Schedule K to the sponsoring ANC by the date Form 1041-N is required to be filed with the IRS. The ANST isn\\'t required to provide information to the beneficiaries on distributions made to them. The sponsoring ANC will provide the beneficiaries with any required information.   \\xa0 Who Must File The trustee of any electing ANST having any taxable income, or having gross income of at least $600 for the tax year, must file Form 1041-N for that year.   \\xa0 Making the Election  \\xa0 The trustee of an ANST must make this election by the due date (including extensions) for filing the ANST\\'s tax return for its first tax year.  \\xa0 The trustee makes the election for the ANST by signing Form 1041-N in the signature block on page 1. The return must be filed by the due date (including extensions) for filing the ANST\\'s tax return for its first tax year. Once the election is made, it applies to all subsequent years and can\\'t be revoked.   \\xa0 When To File ANSTs file Form 1041-N by the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the tax year. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, file on the next business day.  \\xa0 Private Delivery Services You can use certain private delivery services (PDSs) designated by the IRS to meet the \"timely mailing as timely filing\" rule for tax returns. Go to IRS.gov/PDS for the current list of designated services. The PDS can tell you how to get written proof of the mailing date. For the IRS mailing address to use if you’re using a PDS, go to IRS.gov/PDSStreetAddresses.  \\xa0 PDSs can\\'t deliver items to P.O. boxes. You must use the U.S. Postal Service to mail any item to an IRS P.O. box address.    \\xa0 Extension of Time To File Use Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns, to request an automatic extension of time to file. An extension of time to file doesn\\'t extend the time to pay the tax.   \\xa0 Where To File File Form 1041-N at the following address. \\xa0 Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Ogden, UT 84201-0027 \\xa0   \\xa0 Who Must Sign The trustee or an authorized representative must sign Form 1041-N.   \\xa0 Paid Preparer Generally, anyone who is paid to prepare a tax return must sign the return and provide the information requested in the Paid Preparer Use Only area of the return. The person required to sign the return must:    Complete the required preparer information;   Sign it in the space provided for the preparer\\'s signature; and   Give you a copy of the return for your records, in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Paid Preparer Authorization If the trustee wants to allow the IRS to discuss the ANST\\'s tax return with the paid preparer who signed it, check the \"Yes\" box in the signature area of the return. This authorization applies only to the individual whose signature appears in the Paid Preparer Use Only section of the ANST\\'s return. It doesn\\'t apply to the firm, if any, shown in that section. If the \"Yes\" box is checked, the trustee is authorizing the IRS to call the paid preparer to answer any questions that may arise during the processing of the ANST\\'s return. The trustee is also authorizing the paid preparer to:    Give the IRS any information that is missing from the ANST\\'s return;   Call the IRS for information about the processing of the ANST\\'s return or the status of its refund or payment(s); and   Respond to certain IRS notices that the trustee has shared with the preparer about math errors, offsets, and return preparation. The notices won\\'t be sent to the preparer.    \\xa0 The trustee isn\\'t authorizing the paid preparer to receive any refund, enter into any agreement (including those regarding additional tax liability), or otherwise represent the ANST before the IRS. If the trustee wants to expand the paid preparer\\'s authorization, see Pub. 947, Practice Before the IRS and Power of Attorney. The authorization can\\'t be revoked. However, the authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (regardless of extensions) for filing the ANST\\'s next tax return.    \\xa0 Accounting Methods Figure taxable income using the method of accounting regularly used in keeping the ANST\\'s books and records. Generally, permissible methods include the cash method, the accrual method, or any other method authorized by the Internal Revenue Code. In all cases, the method used must clearly reflect income. Generally, the ANST may change its accounting method (overall method or for any material item) only by getting consent on Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method. For more information, see Pub. 538, Accounting Periods and Methods.   \\xa0 Accounting Periods All electing ANSTs must adopt a calendar year.   \\xa0 Rounding Off to Whole Dollars You may round off cents to whole dollars on the ANST\\'s return and schedules. If you do round to whole dollars, you must round all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total.   \\xa0 Estimated Tax Generally, an ANST must pay estimated income tax if it expects to owe at least $1,000 after subtracting withholding and credits. For details and exceptions, see Form 1041-ES, Estimated Income Tax for Estates and Trusts.   \\xa0 Interest and Penalties  \\xa0 Interest Interest is charged on taxes not paid by the due date, even if an extension of time to file is granted. Interest is also charged on the failure-to-file penalty, the accuracy-related penalty, and the fraud penalty. The interest charge is figured at a rate determined under section 6621.   \\xa0 Late Filing of Return Section 6651 provides for penalties for late filing unless there is a reasonable cause for the delay. The law also provides for penalties for willful attempts to evade payment of tax. The penalty won\\'t be imposed if you can show that the failure to file on time is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. If you receive a notice about penalty and interest after you file this return, send us an explanation, and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don\\'t attach an explanation when you file Form 1041-N. For more information about penalties for late filing, see Late Filing of Return in the Instructions for Form 1041.   \\xa0 Late Payment of Tax Section 6651 also provides for penalties for late payment. Generally, the penalty for not paying the tax when due is 1/2 of 1% of the unpaid amount for each month or part of a month it remains unpaid. The maximum penalty is 25% of the unpaid amount. The penalty is imposed on the net amount due. Any penalty is in addition to interest charges on late payments.  \\xa0 If you include interest or either of these penalties with your payment, identify and enter these amounts in the bottom margin of Form 1041-N. Don’t include the interest or penalty amount in the balance of tax due on line 18.   \\xa0 Underpaid Estimated Tax If the trustee underpaid estimated tax, use Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, to figure any penalty due. Enter the amount of the penalty in the bottom margin of Form 1041-N. Don’t include it in the balance of tax due on line 18.   \\xa0 Other Penalties Other penalties can be imposed for negligence, substantial understatement of tax, and fraud. See Pub. 17, Your Federal Income Tax, for details on these penalties.       Specific Instructions   Enter the year (or period) for which you are filing for the electing ANST.  \\xa0 Part I—General Information  \\xa0 Line 1—Name of Trust Enter the exact name that was used to apply for the employer identification number (EIN) for the trust to file Form 1041-N.   \\xa0 Line 3a—Name and Title of Trustee Enter the name and title (if any) of the trustee. If a fiduciary relationship was created or terminated, file Form 56, Notice Concerning Fiduciary Relationship. If a fiduciary relationship wasn\\'t created or terminated but the fiduciary had a change in name or another fiduciary\\'s name was entered, check the \"Change in fiduciary\\'s name\" box on line 6.   \\xa0 Line 3b—Address Include the suite, room, or other unit number after the street address. If the Post Office doesn\\'t deliver mail to the street address and you have a P.O. box, show the box number instead of the street address. If you change your address after filing Form 1041-N, use Form 8822-B, Change of Address or Responsible Party—Business, to notify the IRS. If a different address from the prior year was entered and Form 8822-B wasn\\'t filed, check the box on line 6 for \"Change in fiduciary\\'s address.\"   \\xa0 Line 6 Be sure to check all the boxes that apply. Also, see the line 3a and line 3b instructions above for information regarding a change in the fiduciary\\'s name and for information on changes to the fiduciary\\'s address.    \\xa0 Part II—Tax Computation  \\xa0 Income  \\xa0    Line 2a—Total Ordinary Dividends    Report the total of all ordinary dividends received during the tax year.   \\xa0    Line 2b—Qualified Dividends    Enter the ANST\\'s total qualified dividends on line 2b and use Part IV of Schedule D to figure the ANST\\'s tax. Qualified dividends are eligible for a lower tax rate than other ordinary income. Generally, these dividends are shown in box 1b of Form(s) 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions. See Pub. 550, Investment Income and Expenses, for the definition of qualified dividends if you received dividends not reported on Form 1099-DIV.  Exceptions. Some dividends may be reported as qualified dividends in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV but aren\\'t qualified dividends. These include the following.    Dividends received on any share of stock that the ANST held for less than 61 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the purchaser of a stock isn\\'t entitled to receive the next dividend payment. When counting the number of days the ANST held the stock, include the day you disposed of the stock but not the day you acquired it.   Dividends attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days that the ANST received on any share of preferred stock held for less than 91 days during the 181-day period that began 90 days before the ex-dividend date. Preferred dividends attributable to periods totaling less than 367 days are subject to the 61-day holding period rule above.   Dividends on any share of stock to the extent that the ANST is under an obligation (including a short sale) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.   Payments in lieu of dividends, but only if you know or have reason to know that the payments aren\\'t qualified dividends.    \\xa0    \\xa0    Line 3—Capital Gain or (Loss)    Enter the gain from Schedule D, line 11, or the loss from Schedule D, line 12.  Note. Report capital gain distributions on Schedule D (Form 1041-N), line 7.  \\xa0   \\xa0    Line 4—Other Income    List the type and amount of income not included on lines 1a through 3. List the types and amounts on an attached schedule if the ANST has more than one item of other income. Include on line 4 taxable contributions received from an ANC. See also Part III—Other Information, Question 1, later, for additional information that may need to be attached to the return. Include on this line income recognized on the early disposition of noncash property for which the ANST previously made a section 247(g) election. See also Part III—Other Information, Question 1, later, for additional information that may need to be attached to the return. Include on this line the ordinary income recognized on the disposition of property for which the ANST made a section 247(g) election. Report on Schedule D (Form 1041-N) the capital gain recognized on such disposition. See Section 247(g) Election Property in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041-N) for additional information. If the ANST is reporting global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), include it on the attached statement. Complete and attach Form 8992. If the ANST has a section 965(a) inclusion for the tax year, enter the net amount (the section 965(a) inclusion less the corresponding section 965(c) deduction) on line 4. Complete and attach Form 965, Inclusion of Deferred Foreign Income Upon Transition to Participation Exemption System, and applicable schedules and Form 965-A, Individual Report of Net 965 Tax Liability. Include any excess business loss from Form 461, Limitation on Business Losses, on this line, if applicable.    \\xa0 Deductions  \\xa0    Allocation of Deductions for Tax-Exempt Income    Generally, no deduction is allowed for any expense that is allocable to tax-exempt income, such as interest on state or local bonds.  Exceptions. State income taxes and business expenses that are allocable to tax-exempt interest are deductible. Expenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt income are allocable only to tax-exempt income. A reasonable proportion of expenses indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt income and other income must be allocated to each class of income.    \\xa0    Limitations on Deductions    Generally, the amount an ANST has \"at-risk\" limits the loss it can deduct in any tax year. Also, section 469 and its regulations generally limit losses from passive activities to the amount of income derived from all passive activities. Similarly, credits from passive activities are generally limited to the tax attributable to such activities. For details on these and other limitations on deductions, see Deductions in the Instructions for Form 1041. Miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor will not be allowed for tax years 2018 through 2025.   \\xa0    Line 9—Other Deductions    Attach a schedule listing by type and amount all allowable deductions that aren\\'t deductible elsewhere on the form. No deduction is allowed for distributions to beneficiaries. An ANST may elect under section 965(n) to determine the amount of the net operating loss (NOL) for a tax year determined under section 172 and the amount of taxable income to be reduced by NOL carryovers or carrybacks to such tax year without regard to certain amounts under section 172. The amount not taken into consideration (the reduction amount) is generally equal to the amount of the section 965(a) inclusion (net of the section 965(c) deduction). If, as a result of an election under section 965(n), the amount of the NOL for the tax year is adjusted, the reduction amount is included in other income on line 4. If, as a result of an election under section 965(n), the taxable income reduced by NOL carryovers or carrybacks is reduced, the NOL deduction on line 4 is reduced by the reduction amount. See section 965(n) and the regulations thereunder for more information. In determining whether an expense is deductible it must be determined whether the expense would be \"commonly or customarily\" incurred by a hypothetical individual owning the same property. A cost incurred by an ANST is an allowable deduction to the extent that it is excluded from the definition of miscellaneous itemized deductions under section 67(b) and commonly or customarily would not be incurred by a hypothetical individual holding the same property. Include in line 9 the deduction for qualified business income. For information on how to figure the trust\\'s deduction for qualified business income, see Form 8995, Qualified Business Income Deduction Simplified Computation, and Form 8995-A, Qualified Business Income Deduction.   \\xa0    Line 10—Reserved for Future Use    Don’t enter any information on line 10.   \\xa0    Line 11—Exemption    A trust whose governing instrument requires all income to be distributed currently is allowed a $300 exemption, even if it distributed amounts other than income during the tax year. All other trusts are allowed a $100 exemption.    \\xa0 Tax and Payments  \\xa0    Line 14—Tax    If the ANST doesn\\'t have a net capital gain or qualified dividends and has an amount greater than zero on line 13, check the first box on line 14, multiply the amount on line 13 by 10% (0.10), and enter the result on line 14.  Schedule D. If the ANST had a net capital gain (or qualified dividends) and any taxable income, complete Part IV of Schedule D (Form 1041-N), enter the tax (or -0-, if applicable) from line 28 of Schedule D on line 14, and check the \"Schedule D\" box.     \\xa0    Line 15—Credits    Specify the type of credit being claimed or form number and attach any required credit forms. If you are claiming more than one type of credit, attach a schedule listing the type and amount of each credit claimed. See the Instructions for Form 1041 for details on the credits that may be claimed.   \\xa0    Line 17—Reserved for Future Use    Don’t enter any information on line 17.   \\xa0    Line 18—Total Tax    If the ANST owes any additional taxes (for example, recapture taxes), include these taxes on line 18. To the left of the entry space, write the type and amount of the tax. Also attach to Form 1041-N any forms required to figure these taxes. See the Instructions for Form 1041 for more details on additional taxes that may apply. If the ANST shows more than one type of additional tax on this line, attach a schedule showing the type and amount of each tax, and include the total of all additional taxes on this line. Report on this line of an amended return the additional 10% tax for the year in which the ANST received a contribution of noncash property from an ANC, elected to defer the recognition of income under section 247(g), but disposed of the property within the first tax year subsequent to the tax year the ANST received the property. The increase in tax due to the inclusion of the deferred income, which is the base amount for the computation of the additional 10% tax shown on this line, should be included on line 14. If the amended return also shows changes to income, deductions, or credits unrelated to the inclusion of the deferred income, attach a schedule showing the computation of the additional tax due only to the inclusion of the deferred income. See also Part III—Other Information, Question 1, later, for the statement to be attached to the amended return.   \\xa0    Line 19—Current Year Net 965 Tax Liability Paid     If the ANST made a payment in the current year with respect to a net 965 tax liability, enter on line 19 the amount of the payment reported on Form 965-A, Part II, column (k), for the current year.  \\xa0    Line 20—Payments    Include on line 20 any:    Estimated tax payments made for the tax year;   Tax paid with a request for an extension of time to file;   Federal income tax withheld (for example, backup withholding);   Payment made in the current year with respect to a net 965 tax liability; and   Credit for tax paid on undistributed capital gains. Attach Copy B of Form 2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains.    \\xa0   \\xa0    Line 21—Tax Due    You must pay the tax in full when the return is filed to avoid interest charges and possible penalties.

Note. Pursuant to section 1221(b)(3), the trust can elect to treat musical compositions and copyrights in musical works as capital assets if it sold or exchanged them in a tax year beginning after May 17, 2006, and acquired the assets under circumstances entitling it to the basis of the person who created the property or for whom it was prepared or produced.

An early disposition of property for which the ANST made a section 247(g) election is a disposition that occurs during the first tax year subsequent to the tax year in which such property was contributed to the ANST. The ANST must amend the tax return for the year in which the ANST received the contributed property to report on line 4 the amount of income that would have been included in that year but for the election.   Other dispositions of section 247(g) property. Report on line 4 the amount of income deferred as a result of making the section 247(g) election. Also report any additional gain or loss on the disposition of property as if there was no section 247(g) election, following these Schedule D instructions.   Note. Section 267 doesn\\'t allow an ANST to claim a loss on the disposition of property to a related party. In addition, when an ANST disposes of depreciable property to a related party, section 1239 applies to deny capital gains treatment for any gain.    \\xa0    Short-Term or Long-Term    Separate the capital gains and losses according to how long the ANST held or owned the property. The holding period for short-term capital gains and losses is 1 year or less. The holding period for long-term gains and losses is more than 1 year. To figure the length of the period the ANST held property, begin counting on the day after the ANST acquired the property and include the day the ANST disposed of it. Use the trade dates for the date of acquisition and sale of stocks and bonds traded on an exchange or over-the-counter market. For property received by the ANST from an ANC for which the ANC made an election under section 247(e)(1), the ANST\\'s holding period includes the period the ANC held the property.   \\xa0    Section 643(e)(3) Election    For in-kind noncash property distributions, a fiduciary may elect to have the ANST recognize gain or loss in the same manner as if the distributed property had been sold to the beneficiary at its FMV. If the election is made, the beneficiary\\'s basis of such property is its FMV. This election applies to all distributions made by the ANST during the tax year and, once made, may be revoked only with IRS consent.  Note. Section 267 doesn\\'t allow an ANST to claim a deduction for any loss on property to which a section 643(e)(3) election applies. In addition, when an ANST distributes depreciable property, section 1239 applies to deny capital gains treatment for any gain on property to which a section 643(e)(3) election applies.  For more information on making the section 643(e)(3) election, see Part III—Other Information, Question 5, earlier.    \\xa0         \\xa0    Column (d)—Sales Price    Enter either the gross sales price or the net sales price from the sale. On sales of stocks and bonds, report the gross amount as reported to the ANST on Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions, or similar statement. However, if the ANST was advised that gross proceeds less commissions and option premiums were reported to the IRS, enter only the net amount in column (d).  \\xa0 Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet             Use this worksheet to figure the ANST\\'s capital loss carryovers from the current tax year to the following tax year if Schedule D, line 12, is a loss and (a) the loss on Schedule D, line 11, is more than $3,000; or (b) Form 1041-N, page 1, line 13, is a loss.   1. Enter taxable income (or loss) from Form 1041-N, line 13 1. _____   2. Enter loss from Schedule D, line 12, as a positive amount 2. _____   3. Enter amount from Form 1041-N, line 11 3. _____   4.

Enter gain, if any, from Schedule D, line 10. If that line is blank or shows a loss, enter -0- 7. _____ \\xa0 \\xa0   8. Add lines 5 and 7 8. _____   9. Short-term capital loss carryover. Subtract line 8 from line 6. If zero or less, enter -0-. Enter this loss on the short-term capital loss carryover line of next year\\'s Schedule D 9. _____   \\xa0 Note. If line 10 of Schedule D is a loss, go to line 10; otherwise, skip lines 10 through 14.   10. Enter loss from Schedule D, line 10, as a positive amount 10. _____   11. Enter gain, if any, from Schedule D, line 4. If that line is blank or shows a loss, enter -0- 11. _____ \\xa0 \\xa0   12. Subtract line 6 from line 5.

Enter this loss on the long-term capital loss carryover line of next year\\'s Schedule D 14. _____      \\xa0   \\xa0    Column (e)—Cost or Other Basis    Generally, the basis of property acquired by gift is the same as its basis in the hands of the donor. However, if the FMV of the property at the time it was transferred to the trust is less than the transferor\\'s basis, then the FMV is used for determining any loss on disposition. For property received by the ANST from an ANC for which the ANC made an election under section 247(e)(1), the ANST\\'s basis in the property is the lesser of the adjusted basis of the ANC in the property immediately before the contribution, or the FMV of the property immediately before the contribution. If the property was transferred to the ANST and a gift tax was paid under chapter 12, then increase the donor\\'s basis as follows: multiply the amount of the gift tax paid by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net appreciation in value of the gift (defined below), and the denominator of which is the amount of the gift. For this purpose, the net appreciation in value of the gift is the amount by which the FMV of the gift exceeds the donor\\'s adjusted basis. Then, add the result to the donor\\'s basis.  Adjustments to basis. Before figuring any gain or loss on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property owned by the ANST, adjustments to the property\\'s basis may be required. See Pub. 551 for additional information.    \\xa0    Column (f)—Gain or (Loss)    Make a separate entry in this column for each transaction reported on lines 1 and 5 and any other lines that apply to the ANST. For lines 1 and 5, subtract the amount in column (e) from the amount in column (d). Enter negative amounts in parentheses.   \\xa0    Line 23    Add line 18 from the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet and line 7 from the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet.  Exclusion of gain on qualified small business (QSB) stock. Section 1202 allows you to exclude a portion of the eligible gain on the sale or exchange of certain QSB stock.  \\xa0 How to report. Report on line 5 of Schedule D the gain realized on the sale of QSB stock. Complete all columns as indicated. Directly below the line on which you report the gain, enter in column (a) \"Section 1202 exclusion\" and enter as a loss in column (f) the amount of allowable exclusion. If you are completing line 23 of Schedule D, enter as a positive number the amount of your allowable exclusion on line 2 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet; if you excluded 60% of the gain, enter 2/3 of the exclusion; if you excluded 75% of the gain, enter 1/3 of the exclusion. Don’t make an entry for any section 1202 exclusion that is 100% of the gain. For more information about QSB stock, see the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041).     \\xa0    Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain    Complete the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet if any of the following apply.    During the tax year, the ANST sold or otherwise disposed of section 1250 property (generally, real property that was depreciated) held more than 1 year.   The ANST received installment payments during the tax year for section 1250 property held more than 1 year for which it is reporting gain on the installment method.   The ANST received a Schedule K-1 from an estate or trust, partnership, or S corporation that shows \"unrecaptured section 1250 gain\" reportable for the tax year.   The ANST received a Form 1099-DIV or Form 2439 from a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company (including a mutual fund) that reports \"unrecaptured section 1250 gain\" for the tax year.   The ANST reported a long-term capital gain from the sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership that owned section 1250 property.    \\xa0   \\xa0    Instructions for the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet     \\xa0 Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet             If the ANST isn\\'t reporting a gain on Form 4797, Sales of Business Property, line 7 (for 2019, or the comparable line for the current tax year), skip lines 1 through 9 and go to line 10.    1.

Combine this result with the result on line 7 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet, if any, and enter that result on Schedule D, line 23 18. _____       Lines 1 through 3. If the ANST had more than one property described on line 1, complete lines 1 through 3 for each property on a separate worksheet. Enter the total of the line 3 amounts for all properties on line 3 and go to line 4.   Line 4. To figure the amount to enter on line 4, follow the steps below for each installment sale of trade or business property held more than 1 year.   \\xa0 Step 1. Figure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable, or (b) the total gain for the sale. This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable lines of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property.   \\xa0 Step 2. Reduce the amount figured in Step 1 by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable line of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain that must be allocated to the installment payments received from the sale.    \\xa0 Step 3. Generally, the amount of section 1231 gain on each installment payment is treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain until the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain figured in Step 2 has been used in full. Figure the amount of gain treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for installment payments received during the tax year as the smaller of (a) the amount from line 26 or line 37 of the 2019 Form 6252 (or comparable lines for the current tax year), whichever applies; or (b) the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported. This amount is generally the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture). However, if you chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount you chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale. Include this amount on line 4.    Line 10. Include on line 10 the ANST\\'s share of the partnership\\'s unrecaptured section 1250 gain that would result if the partnership had transferred all of its section 1250 property in a fully taxable transaction immediately before the ANST sold or exchanged its interest in that partnership. If the ANST recognized less than all of the realized gain, the partnership will be treated as having transferred only a proportionate amount of each section 1250 property.    Line 12. An example of an amount to include on line 12 is unrecaptured section 1250 gain from the sale of a vacation home previously used as a rental property but converted to personal use prior to the sale.  \\xa0 Installment sales. To figure the amount to include on line 12, follow the steps below for each installment sale of property held more than 1 year for which you didn’t make an entry in Part I of Form 4797 for the year of sale.   \\xa0 Step 1. Figure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable, or (b) the total gain for the sale. This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of the 2019 Form 4797 (or comparable lines of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property.    \\xa0 Step 2. Reduce the amount figured in Step 1 by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable line of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain that must be allocated to the installment payments received from the sale.   \\xa0 Step 3. Generally, the amount of capital gain on each installment payment is treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain until the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain figured in Step 2 has been used in full. Figure the amount of gain treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for installment payments received during the tax year as the smaller of (a) the amount from line 26 or line 37 of the 2019 Form 6252 (or comparable lines for the current tax year), whichever applies; or (b) the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported. This amount is generally the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture). However, if you chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount you chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale. Include this amount on line 12.   \\xa0 Other sales or dispositions of section 1250 property. For each sale of property held more than 1 year (for which an entry wasn\\'t made in Part I of Form 4797), figure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable, or (b) the total gain for the sale. This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of Form 4797 (for 2019, or the comparable line for the current tax year) for that property. Next, reduce that amount by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of Form 4797 (for 2019, or the comparable line for the current tax year) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale. Include this amount on line 12.      \\xa0    28% Rate Gain or (Loss)    Complete the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet if lines 10 and 11 of Schedule D are both greater than zero and the ANST reports in Part II, column (f), either:    A section 1202 gain on qualified small business stock, or   A collectibles gain or (loss).    \\xa0 A collectibles gain or loss is any long-term gain or deductible long-term loss from the sale or exchange of a collectible that is a capital asset.

A copy of this schedule must be furnished to the sponsoring ANC. The sponsoring ANC, not the ANST, provides information to the beneficiaries regarding distributions. Distributions for each year are considered to have been made in the following order. \\xa0  \\xa0     Tier I Distributions (Section 646(e)(1))    These are distributions from the ANST to the extent of the ANST\\'s taxable income, reduced by any income tax paid by the ANST on that income, and increased by any tax-exempt interest income. Tier I distributions are excluded from the gross income of the beneficiary. \\xa0   \\xa0     Tier II Distributions (Section 646(e)(2))    These are distributions of amounts that would have been Tier I distributions in prior years (during which a section 646 election was in effect), but that have not, in fact, been distributed in any prior year. Tier II distributions are excluded from the gross income of the beneficiary. \\xa0   \\xa0     Tier III Distributions (Section 646(e)(3))    These are distributions considered to have been made by the sponsoring ANC with respect to its stock. Tier III distributions are taxable to beneficiaries as dividends, to the extent of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the sponsoring ANC (after adjustment for distributions made by the sponsoring ANC during the year). Section 643(e) applies for purposes of determining the amount of a Tier III distribution of property (other than cash). \\xa0   \\xa0     Tier IV Distributions (Section 646(e)(4))    These are distributions of any amounts that remain after applying the above rules. They are considered as amounts in excess of distributable net income for the year. Tier IV distributions are excluded from the gross income of the beneficiary.

See Lines 1a and 8a, later, for more information about when Form 8949 is and isn\\'t needed. Use Form 4797 to report the following.    The sale or exchange of:    Real property used in a trade or business;   Depreciable and amortizable tangible property used in a trade or business (but see Disposition of Depreciable Property Not Used in Trade or Business in the Instructions for Form 4797);   Oil, gas, geothermal, or other mineral property; and   Section 126 property.      The involuntary conversion (other than from casualty or theft) of property used in a trade or business and capital assets held more than 1 year for business or profit. But see Disposition of Depreciable Property Not Used in Trade or Business in the Instructions for Form 4797.   The disposition of noncapital assets other than inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.   Ordinary loss on the sale, exchange, or worthlessness of small business investment company (section 1242) stock.   Ordinary loss on the sale, exchange, or worthlessness of small business (section 1244) stock.    \\xa0 Use Form 4684 to report involuntary conversions of property due to casualty or theft.

A like-kind exchange occurs when the estate or trust exchanges business or investment property for property of a like kind. Use Form 8971 (including Schedule(s) A) to report basis between an estate and a person acquiring property from a decedent.   \\xa0 Special Rules for Determining Basis of Estate and Trust Property  Basis of trust property. Generally, the basis of property acquired by gift is the same as its basis in the hands of the donor. However, if the fair market value (FMV) of the property at the time it was transferred to the trust is less than the transferor\\'s basis, then the FMV is used to determine any loss upon disposition. If the property was transferred to the trust after 1976, and a gift tax was paid under Chapter 12, then increase the donor\\'s basis as follows: Multiply the amount of the gift tax paid by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net appreciation in value of the gift (defined below), and the denominator of which is the amount of the gift. For this purpose, the net appreciation in value of the gift is the amount by which the FMV of the gift exceeds the donor\\'s adjusted basis.   Basis of decedent\\'s estate property. Generally, the basis of property acquired by a decedent\\'s estate is the FMV of the property at the date of the decedent\\'s death, or the alternate valuation date if the executor elected to use an alternate valuation under section 2032. See Pub. 551 and the Instructions for Form 706 for a discussion of the valuation of qualified real property under section 2032A.   Consistent basis reporting between estate and person acquiring property from a decedent. Section 2004 of Public Law 114-41 has two major requirements. 1. An executor of an estate (or other person) required to file an estate tax return after July 31, 2015, must provide a Form 8971 with attached Schedules A to the IRS, and a copy of the beneficiary’s Schedule A to each beneficiary who receives or is to receive property from the estate. The Schedule A must show the final estate tax value of the property received or to be received by the beneficiary. An executor (or other person) who files an estate tax return only to make an election regarding the generation-skipping transfer tax or portability of the deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) may not be required to provide Form 8971 and Schedule A. 2. If Part 2, column C of the Schedule A received by the beneficiary indicates that the property increases the estate tax liability, the beneficiary must use a basis consistent with the final estate tax value of the property to determine the beneficiary’s basis in that property. Calculate a basis consistent with the final estate tax value by starting with the reported value and then making any allowed adjustments. For more information, see the  Instructions for Form 8971 and Schedule A and Column (e)—Cost or Other Basis in the  Instructions for Form 8949.   Basis of property acquired from a decedent who died in 2010. See Pub. 4895, Tax Treatment of Property Acquired From a Decedent Dying in 2010, for details about determining the basis of property acquired from a decedent who died in 2010.   Basis of assets held on January 1, 2001, where an election to recognize gain was made. If you elected on behalf of an estate or trust to recognize gain on an asset held on January 1, 2001, the basis in the asset is its closing market price or FMV, whichever applies, on the date of the deemed sale and reacquisition, whether the deemed sale resulted in a gain or an unallowed loss.   Carryover basis. Carryover basis determined under repealed section 1023 applies to property acquired from a decedent who died after December 31, 1976, and before November 7, 1978, only if the executor made a timely filed election on Form 5970-A, Election of Carryover Basis.   Property received from an Alaska Native Corporation. The basis of property received by an Alaska Native Settlement Trust from an Alaska Native Corporation is the lesser of the basis of the Native Corporation in the property or the FMV immediately before the contribution of the property to the trust. The basis and FMV of the property are shown on the statement provided by the Native Corporation to the Settlement Trust.     \\xa0 Capital Asset  Each item of property held by the estate or trust (whether or not connected with a trade or business) is a capital asset, except the following.    Stock in trade, inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers.   Depreciable or real property used in a trade or business, even if it\\'s fully depreciated.   Certain patents, inventions, models, or designs (whether or not patented); secret formulas or processes; or similar property. See section 1221(a)(3).   Copyrights; literary, musical, or artistic compositions; letters or memoranda; or similar property eligible for copyright protection that the trust received from someone whose personal efforts created them or for whom they were created in a way (such as by gift) that entitled the trust to the basis of the previous owner. In the case of letters, memoranda, or similar property, such property may also be prepared or produced for the trust. Note. Under section 1221(b)(3), the trust can elect to treat musical compositions and copyrights in musical works as capital assets if it acquired the assets under circumstances entitling it to the basis of the person who created the property or for whom it was prepared or produced.   Accounts or notes receivable acquired in the ordinary course of a trade or business for services rendered or from the sale of inventoriable assets or property held primarily for sale to customers.   Certain U.S. Government publications not purchased at the public sale price.   Certain \"commodities derivative financial instruments\" held by a dealer (see section 1221(a)(6)).   Certain hedging transactions entered into in the normal course of a trade or business (see section 1221(a)(7)).   Supplies regularly used in a trade or business.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Short-Term or Long-Term  Separate the capital gains and losses according to how long the estate or trust held or owned the property. The holding period for short-term capital gains and losses is generally 1 year or less. The holding period for long-term capital gains and losses is generally more than 1 year. Property acquired from a decedent is treated as held for more than 1 year. To figure the length of the period the estate or trust held property, begin counting on the day after the estate or trust acquired the property and include the day it was disposed. Use the trade dates for the dates of acquisition and sale of stocks and bonds traded on an exchange or over-the-counter market. The holding period for property received by an Alaska Native Settlement Trust from an Alaska Native Corporation includes the period the Native Corporation held the property. The date the Native Corporation acquired the property is shown on the statement provided by the Native Corporation to the Settlement Trust. Beginning in 2018, the long-term holding period for certain gains with respect to “applicable partnership interests” is more than 3 years. See Pub. 541 for more information. For more information about holding periods, see the Instructions for Form 8949.   \\xa0 Section 643(e)(3) Election  For in-kind noncash property distributions, a fiduciary may elect to have the estate or trust recognize gain or loss in the same manner as if the distributed property had been sold to the beneficiary at its FMV. The distribution deduction is the property\\'s FMV. This election applies to all distributions made by the estate or trust during the tax year. Once the election is made, it may only be revoked with IRS consent.  Note. Section 267 doesn\\'t allow a trust or a decedent\\'s estate to claim a deduction for any loss on property to which a section 643(e)(3) election applies. In addition, when a trust or a decedent\\'s estate distributes depreciable property, section 1239 applies to deny capital gains treatment for any gain on property to which a section 643(e)(3) election applies.    \\xa0 Related Persons A trust can\\'t deduct a loss from the sale or exchange of property directly or indirectly between any of the following:    A grantor and a fiduciary of a trust,   A fiduciary of a trust and a fiduciary (or beneficiary) of another trust created by the same grantor,   A fiduciary and a beneficiary of the same trust,   A trust fiduciary and a corporation of which more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock is owned directly or indirectly by or for the trust or by or for the grantor of the trust, or   An executor of an estate and a beneficiary of that estate, except when the sale or exchange is to satisfy a pecuniary bequest (that is, a bequest of a sum of money).    \\xa0   \\xa0 Items for Special Treatment \\xa0    Bonds and other debt instruments. See Pub. 550, Investment Income and Expenses (Including Capital Gains and Losses).   Gain on the disposition of a market discount bond. In general, the gain is recharacterized as interest income to the extent of accrued market discount as of the date of disposition. See sections 1276 through 1278 and Pub. 550 for more information on market discount. See the Instructions for Form 8949 for detailed information about how to report the disposition of a market discount bond.   Gain or loss recognized on the disposition of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to the noncontingent bond method. The gain is generally treated as interest income rather than as capital gain. In certain situations, all or a portion of a loss recognized on the disposition of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to the noncontingent bond method may be treated as an ordinary loss rather than as a capital loss. See Regulations section 1.1275-4(b) and Pub. 550 for more information on contingent payment debt instruments subject to the noncontingent bond method.   A nonbusiness bad debt must be treated as a short-term capital loss and can be deducted only in the year the debt becomes totally worthless. See Pub. 550 for details.   Wash sales of stock or securities (including contracts or options to acquire or sell stock or securities) (section 1091).   Gain or loss on options to buy or sell. See Pub. 550.   Certain real estate subdivided for sale that may be considered a capital asset (section 1237).   Gain on disposition of stock in domestic international sales corporations (DISC) (section 995(c)).   Gain on the sale or exchange of stock in certain foreign corporations (section 1248).   Sales of stock received under a qualified public utility dividend reinvestment plan. See Pub. 550 for details.   Transfer of appreciated property to a political organization (section 84).   Amounts received by shareholders in corporate liquidations. See Pub. 550.   Cash received in lieu of fractional shares of stock as a result of a stock split or stock dividend. See Pub. 550.   Load charges to acquire stock in a regulated investment company (including a mutual fund), which may not be taken into account in determining gain or loss on certain dispositions of the stock if reinvestment rights were exercised. See Pub. 550.   The sale or exchange of S corporation stock or an interest in a trust held for more than 1 year, which may result in collectibles gain (28% rate gain). See the instructions for line 18c.   The sale or other disposition of a partnership interest may result in ordinary income, collectibles gain, or unrecaptured section 1250 gain.   Gain or loss on the disposition of securities futures contracts. See Pub. 550.   Gains from certain constructive ownership transactions. Gain in excess of the gain the estate or trust would have recognized if the estate or trust held a financial asset directly during the term of a derivative contract must be treated as ordinary income. See section 1260 for details.   If qualified dividends include extraordinary dividends, any loss on the sale or exchange of the stock is a long-term capital loss to the extent of the extraordinary dividends. An extraordinary dividend is a dividend that is at least 10% (5% in the case of preferred stock) of the basis in the stock.   Gain or loss from a sale, exchange, or other disposition of virtual currency if held as a capital asset. See Notice 2014-21, 2014-16 I.R.B. 938.   NAV method for money market funds. Report capital gain or loss determined under the net asset value (NAV) method with respect to shares in a money market fund on Form 8949, Part I, with box C checked. Enter the name of each fund followed by “(NAV)” in column (a). Enter the net gain or loss in column (h). Leave all other columns blank. See the Instructions for Form 8949.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Constructive Sales Treatment for Certain Appreciated Positions Generally, the estate or trust must recognize gain (but not loss) on the date it enters into a constructive sale of any appreciated position in stock, a partnership interest, or certain debt instruments as if the position were disposed of at FMV on that date. The estate or trust is treated as making a constructive sale of an appreciated position when it (or a related person, in some cases) does one of the following:    Enters into a short sale of the same or substantially identical property (that is, a \"short sale against the box\"),   Enters into an offsetting notional principal contract relating to the same or substantially identical property,   Enters into a futures or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially identical property, or   Acquires the same or substantially identical property (if the appreciated position is a short sale, offsetting notional principal contract, or a futures or forward contract).    \\xa0  Exception. Generally, constructive sale treatment doesn\\'t apply if:     The estate or trust closed the transaction before the end of the 30th day after the end of the year in which it was entered into,   The estate or trust held the appreciated position to which the transaction relates throughout the 60-day period starting on the date the transaction was closed, and   At no time during that 60-day period was the estate\\'s or trust\\'s risk of loss reduced by holding certain other positions.    \\xa0 For details and other exceptions to these rules, see Pub. 550.    \\xa0 Exclusion of Gain on Qualified Small Business (QSB) Stock (Section 1202)  Section 1202 allows you to exclude a portion of the eligible gain on the sale or exchange of QSB stock held for more than 5 years. You can exclude up to 50% of the qualified gain if you acquired the QSB stock on or before February 17, 2009. You can exclude up to 60% of the qualified gain on certain empowerment zone business stock for gain attributable to periods on or before December 31, 2018. The 60% exclusion doesn\\'t apply to gain attributable to periods after December 31, 2018. See Empowerment zone business stock, later. The exclusion is increased to 75% on the sale or exchange of QSB stock acquired after February 17, 2009, and before September 28, 2010. The exclusion is increased to 100% on the sale of QSB stock acquired after September 27, 2010. To be QSB stock, the stock must meet all of the following tests:    It must be stock in a C corporation (that is, not S corporation stock).   It must have been originally issued after August 10, 1993.   As of the date the stock was issued, the corporation was a QSB. A QSB is a domestic C corporation with total gross assets of $50 million or less (a) at all times after August 9, 1993, and before the stock was issued, and (b) immediately after the stock was issued. Gross assets include those of any predecessor of the corporation. All corporations that are members of the same parent-subsidiary controlled group are treated as one corporation.   The estate or trust acquired the stock at its original issue (either directly or through an underwriter), either in exchange for money or other property or as pay for services (other than as an underwriter) to the corporation. In certain cases, the estate or trust may meet the test if it acquired the stock from another person who met this test (such as by gift or inheritance) or through a conversion or exchange of QSB stock the estate or trust held.   During substantially all the time the estate or trust held the stock:    The corporation was a C corporation,   At least 80% of the value of the corporation\\'s assets was used in the active conduct of one or more qualified businesses (defined below), and   The corporation wasn\\'t a foreign corporation, DISC, former DISC, corporation that has made (or that has a subsidiary that has made) a section 936 election, regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, real estate mortgage investment conduit, financial asset securitization investment trust, or cooperative.       \\xa0  Note. A specialized small business investment company (SSBIC) is treated as having met test 5b above.  \\xa0  Qualified business. A qualified business is any business other than the following:     One involving services performed in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage services;   One whose principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more employees;   Any banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business;   Any farming business (including the raising or harvesting of trees);   Any business involving the production of products for which percentage depletion can be claimed; or   Any business of operating a hotel, motel, restaurant, or similar business.    \\xa0 For more details about limits and additional requirements that may apply, see Pub. 550 or section 1202.   Acquisition date of stock acquired after February 17, 2009. When determining whether the exclusion is limited to 50%, 75%, or 100% of the gain from the QSB stock, the acquisition date is considered to be the first day the stock is held (determined after applying the holding period rules in section 1223).   Empowerment zone business stock. Generally, the estate or trust can exclude up to 60% of its gain on certain QSB stock if it meets the following additional requirements.     The stock sold or exchanged was stock in a corporation that qualified as an empowerment zone business during substantially all of the time the estate or trust held the stock.   The estate or trust acquired the stock after December 21, 2000, and before February 18, 2009.   The gain from the sale or exchange of the stock is attributable to periods on or before December 31, 2018.    \\xa0 Requirement 1 will still be met if the corporation ceased to qualify after the 5-year period that began on the date the estate or trust acquired the stock. However, the gain that qualifies for the 60% exclusion can\\'t be more than the gain the estate or trust would have had if it had sold the stock on the date the corporation ceased to qualify. See section 1397C for more details.   Stock acquired after February 17, 2009. The estate or trust can exclude up to 75% of the gain if it acquired the stock after February 17, 2009, and before September 28, 2010.  The estate or trust can exclude up to 100% of the gain if it acquired the stock after September 27, 2010.   Pass-through entities. If the estate or trust held an interest in a pass-through entity (a partnership, S corporation, mutual fund, or other regulated investment company) that sold QSB stock, the estate or trust generally must have held the interest on the date the pass-through entity acquired the QSB stock and at all times thereafter until the stock was sold to qualify for the exclusion.   \\xa0 How to report. Report the sale or exchange of the QSB stock on Form 8949, Part II, with the appropriate box checked, as you would if you weren\\'t taking the exclusion. Enter \"Q\" in column (f) and enter the amount of the excluded gain as a negative number in column (g). Put it in parentheses to show it is negative. See the Instructions for Form 8949, columns (f), (g), and (h). Complete all remaining columns.

If all payments aren\\'t received in the year of sale, a sale of QSB stock that isn\\'t traded on an established securities market generally is treated as an installment sale and is reported on Form 6252. Part or all of any gain from the sale that is reported on Form 6252 for the current year may be eligible for the section 1202 exclusion. Report the long-term gain from Form 6252 on Schedule D, line 11. In column (a) of Form 8949, Part II, enter the name of the corporation whose stock was sold.

If the estate or trust held QSB stock (as defined earlier) for more than 6 months, it may elect to postpone gain if it purchased other QSB stock during the 60-day period that began on the date of the sale.   The estate or trust must recognize gain to the extent the sale proceeds exceed the cost of the replacement stock. Reduce the basis of the replacement stock by any postponed gain.   The estate or trust must make the election no later than the due date (including extensions) for filing Form 1041 for the tax year in which the stock was sold. If the original Form 1041 was filed on time, the election may be made on an amended return filed no later than 6 months after the due date of the original return (excluding extensions). Write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" at the top of the amended return, and file it at the same address used for the original Form 1041.    \\xa0 How to report. To make the election, report the sale on Part I or Part II of Form 8949 (depending on how long the estate or trust owned the stock), as it would be reported if the election wasn\\'t made.

See the instructions for Form 8949, columns (f), (g), and (h). Complete all remaining columns. Report the sale or exchange of qualified community business property on Form 4797. See the Form 4797 instructions for details.   Deferral of gain invested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF). If the estate or trust has an eligible gain (defined below), it can invest that gain in a QOF and elect to defer part or all of the gain that it would otherwise include in income until the estate or trust sells or exchanges the investment in the QOF or December 31, 2026, whichever is earlier. If the election is made, only include gain to the extent, if any, that the amount of realized gain is more than the aggregate amount invested in a QOF during the 180-day period beginning on the date the gain was realized. The estate or trust may also be able to permanently exclude the gain from the sale or exchange of any investment in a QOF if the investment is held for at least 10 years.   \\xa0 QOF. A QOF is any investment vehicle that is organized as either a corporation or partnership for the purpose of investing in eligible property that is located in a Qualified Opportunity Zone.   \\xa0 Eligible gain. Gain that is eligible to be deferred if it is invested in a QOF includes any amount treated as a capital gain for federal income tax purposes. See section 1400Z for more details on QOFs and the special rules. Also, see IRS.gov/Newsroom/Opportunity-Zones-Frequently-Asked-Questions.   \\xa0 How to report. Report the eligible gain as you normally would on Schedule D (Form 1041). See the Form 8949 instructions for how to report the deferral. You also need to attach Form 8997 annually until you dispose of the QOF investment. See the Instructions for Form 8997.         Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041) - Notices     \\xa0 Specific Instructions  \\xa0 The instructions below assume the estate or trust is a cash basis calendar year taxpayer.  \\xa0 Rounding Off Whole Dollars You can round off cents to whole dollars on your Schedule D (Form 1041). If you do round to whole dollars, you must round all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the decimal point. There is no cents column on the form.   \\xa0 Disposal of QOF investment If you disposed of any investment in a QOF during the tax year, check the box on page 1 of Schedule D and see the Instructions for Form 8949 for additional reporting requirements. You must also complete Part III of Form 8997. See the Instructions for Form 8997 for details.   \\xa0 Lines 1a and 8a—Transactions Not Reported on Form 8949 The estate or trust can report on line 1a (for short-term transactions) or line 8a (for long-term transactions) the aggregate totals from any transactions (except sales of collectibles) for which:    The estate or trust received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) that shows basis was reported to the IRS and doesn\\'t show any adjustments in boxes 1f or 1g,   The Ordinary check box in box 2 of Form 1099-B is not checked,   The QOF check box in box 3 of Form 1099-B is not checked,   The estate or trust isn\\'t electing to defer income due to an investment in a QOF and isn\\'t terminating deferral from an investment in a QOF, and   The estate or trust doesn\\'t need to make any adjustments to the basis or type of gain or loss (short term or long term) reported on Form 1099-B (or substitute statement), or to its gain or loss.    \\xa0 See How To Complete Form 8949, Columns (f) and (g), in the Form 8949 instructions for details about possible adjustments to your gain or loss. If the estate or trust chooses to report these transactions on lines 1a and 8a, don\\'t report them on Form 8949. You don\\'t need to attach a statement to explain the entries on lines 1a and 8a. Figure gain or loss on each line. First, subtract the cost or other basis in column (e) from the proceeds (sales price) in column (d). Enter the gain or loss in column (h). Enter negative amounts in parentheses. Example 1 – basis reported to the IRS.  The estate or trust received a Form 1099-B reporting the sale of stock held for 3 years. It shows proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 is checked, meaning that basis was reported to the IRS. The estate or trust doesn\\'t need to make any adjustments to the amounts reported on Form 1099-B or enter any codes. This was the estate or trust\\'s only 2019 transaction. Instead of reporting this transaction on Form 8949, the estate or trust can enter $6,000 on Schedule D, line 8a, column (d), $2,000 in column (e), and $4,000 ($6,000 – $2,000) in column (h). If you had a second transaction that was the same except that the proceeds were $5,000 and the basis was $3,000, combine the two transactions. Enter $11,000 ($6,000 + $5,000) on Schedule D, line 8a, column (d); $5,000 ($2,000 + $3,000) in column (e); and $6,000 ($11,000 – $5,000) in column (h). Example 2 – basis not reported to the IRS.  The estate or trust received a Form 1099-B showing proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 isn\\'t checked, meaning that basis wasn\\'t reported to the IRS. Don\\'t report this transaction on line 1a or line 8a. Instead, report the transaction on Form 8949. Complete all necessary pages of Form 8949 before completing line 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, or 10 of Schedule D (Form 1041). Example 3 – adjustment.  The estate or trust received a Form 1099-B showing proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 is checked, meaning that basis was reported to the IRS. However, the basis shown in box 1e is incorrect. Don\\'t report this transaction on line 1a or line 8a. Instead, report the transaction on Form 8949. See the Instructions for Form 8949, columns (f), (g), and (h). Complete all necessary pages of Form 8949 before completing line 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, or 10 of Schedule D (Form 1041).   \\xa0 Lines 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, and 10, Column (h)—Transactions Reported on Form 8949 Figure gain or loss on each line. First, subtract the cost or other basis in column (e) from the proceeds (sales price) in column (d). Then combine the result with any adjustments in column (g). Enter the gain or loss in column (h). Enter negative amounts in parentheses. Example 1 – gain.  Column (d) is $6,000 and column (e) is $2,000. Enter $4,000 in column (h). Example 2 – loss.  Column (d) is $6,000 and column (e) is $8,000. Enter ($2,000) in column (h). Example 3 – adjustment.  Column (d) is $6,000, column (e) is $2,000, and column (g) is ($1,000). Enter $3,000 ($6,000 − $2,000 − $1,000) in column (h).   \\xa0 Lines 4 and 11  Undistributed capital gains.  Include on line 11, column (h), the amount from box 1a of Form 2439. This amount represents the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of undistributed long-term capital gains from a regulated investment company (mutual fund) or real estate investment trust.   If there is an amount in box 1b of Form 2439, include that amount on line 11 of the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet, later, if you are required to complete line 18b, column (2) of the schedule. If there is an amount in box 1c of Form 2439, see Exclusion of Gain on Qualified Small Business (QSB) Stock (Section 1202), earlier. If there is an amount in box 1d of Form 2439, include that amount on line 4 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet.    Enter on Form 1041, Schedule G, Part II, line 16a, the tax paid as reported in box 2 of Form 2439. Increase the basis of the stock by the excess of the amount included in income over the amount of the credit for tax paid. See Pub. 550 for more details.   Installment sales.  If the estate or trust sold property (other than publicly traded stocks or securities) at a gain during the tax year and will receive a payment in a later tax year, you generally report the sale on the installment method and file Form 6252, unless you elect not to do so.   Also, use Form 6252 to report any payment received in 2019 from a sale made in an earlier tax year that was reported on the installment method.   To elect out of the installment method, report the full amount of the gain on Form 8949 on a timely filed return (including extensions) for the year of the sale. If the original return was filed timely, the election may be made on an amended return filed no later than 6 months after the due date of the original return (excluding extensions). Write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" at the top of the amended return, and file it at the same address as the original Form 1041.   Exchange of \"like-kind\" property.  Generally, no gain or loss is recognized when property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is exchanged solely for property of a like kind to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment. However, if a trust exchanges like-kind property with a related person (see Related Persons, earlier) and within 2 years of the last transfer that was part of the exchange, the related person disposes of the property, or the trust disposes of the property received in exchange from the related person, then the original exchange will not qualify for nonrecognition. See section 1031(f) for exceptions.   Complete and attach Form 8824 to Form 1041 for each exchange.    \\xa0 Line 13—Capital Gain Distributions Enter as a long-term capital gain on line 13, column (h), the total capital gain distributions paid during the year, regardless of how long the estate or trust held its investment. This amount is reported in box 2a of Form 1099-DIV. If there is an amount in box 2b, include that amount on line 11 of the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet, later, if the worksheet is required. If there is an amount in box 2c, see Exclusion of Gain on Qualified Small Business (QSB) Stock (Section 1202), earlier. If there is an amount in box 2d of Form 1099-DIV, include the amount on line 4 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet.   \\xa0 Line 17, Column (1)—Beneficiaries\\' Net Short-Term Capital Gain or Loss Enter the amount of net short-term capital gain or loss allocable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Include only those short-term capital losses that are taken into account in determining the amount of gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets that is paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiary during the tax year. See Regulations section 1.643(a)-3 for more information about allocation of capital gains and losses. If the losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets are more than the gains, the net loss must be allocated to the estate or trust and not to the beneficiaries.   \\xa0 Line 17, Column (2)—Estate\\'s or Trust\\'s Net Short-Term Capital Gain or Loss Enter the amount of the net short-term capital gain or loss allocable to the estate or trust. Include any capital gain paid or permanently set aside for a charitable purpose specified in section 642(c).   \\xa0 Line 17, Column (3)—Total Enter the total of the amounts entered in columns (1) and (2). The amount in column (3) should be the same as the amount on line 7.   \\xa0 Line 18a—Net Long-Term Capital Gain or Loss Allocate the net long-term capital gain or loss on line 18a in the same manner as the net short-term capital gain or loss on line 17. However, don\\'t take the section 1202 exclusion on gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock into account when figuring net long-term capital gain or loss allocable to the beneficiaries.   \\xa0 Line 18b—Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain  Complete the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet, later, if any of the following apply.    During the tax year, the estate or trust sold or otherwise disposed of section 1250 property (generally, real property that was depreciated) held more than 1 year.   The estate or trust received installment payments during the tax year for section 1250 property held more than 1 year and is reporting gain on the installment method.   The estate or trust received a Schedule K-1 from an estate or trust, partnership, or S corporation that reports \"unrecaptured section 1250 gain\" for the tax year.   The estate or trust received a Form 1099-DIV or Form 2439 from a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company (including a mutual fund) that reports \"unrecaptured section 1250 gain\" for the tax year.   The estate or trust reported a long-term capital gain from the sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership that owned section 1250 property.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet—Line 18b \\xa0                \\xa0 If the estate or trust isn\\'t reporting a gain on Form 4797, line 7, skip lines 1 through 9 and go to line 10. \\xa0   1.

Subtract line 17 from line 13. If zero or less, enter -0-. Enter the result here and in the appropriate columns of Schedule D, line 18b 18. \\xa0 _____ \\xa0   \\xa0        \\xa0 Instructions for the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet  Lines 1 through 3. If the estate or trust had more than one property, complete lines 1 through 3 for each property on a separate worksheet. Next, enter the total amount for all properties on line 3, then go to line 4.   Line 4. To figure the amount to enter on line 4, follow the steps below for each installment sale of trade or business property held more than 1 year.  \\xa0 Step 1. Figure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable or (b) the total gain for the sale. This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable lines of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property.   \\xa0 Step 2. Reduce the amount figured in step 1 by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable line of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain that must be allocated to the installment payments received from the sale.   \\xa0 Step 3. Generally, the amount of section 1231 gain on each installment payment is treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain until the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain figured in step 2 has been used in full. Figure the amount of gain treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for installment payments received during the tax year as the smaller of (a) the amount from line 26 or line 37 of the 2019 Form 6252, whichever applies, or (b) the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported. This amount is generally the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture). However, if you chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount you chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale. Include this amount on line 4.    Line 10. Include on line 10 the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of the partnership\\'s unrecaptured section 1250 gain that would result if the partnership had transferred all of its section 1250 property in a fully taxable transaction immediately before the estate or trust sold or exchanged its interest in that partnership. If the estate or trust recognized less than all of the realized gain, the partnership will be treated as having transferred only a proportionate amount of each section 1250 property.   Line 12. An example of an amount reported on line 12 as an \"other disposition\" includes unrecaptured section 1250 gain from the sale of a vacation home previously used as a rental property that was converted to personal use before the sale. To figure the amount to enter on line 12, follow the applicable instructions below.  \\xa0 Installment sales. To figure the amount to include on line 12, follow the steps below for each installment sale of property held more than 1 year for which you didn\\'t make an entry in Part I of Form 4797 for the year of sale.    \\xa0 Step 1. Figure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable or (b) the total gain for the sale. This is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of the 2019 Form 4797 (or comparable lines of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property.   \\xa0 Step 2. Reduce the amount figured in step 1 by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of the 2019 Form 4797 (or the comparable line of Form 4797 for the year of sale) for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain that must be allocated to the installment payments received from the sale.   \\xa0 Step 3. Generally, the amount of capital gain on each installment payment is treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain until the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain figured in step 2 has been used in full. Figure the amount of gain treated as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for installment payments received during the tax year as the smaller of (a) the amount from line 26 or line 37 of the 2019 Form 6252, whichever applies, or (b) the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported. This amount is generally the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture). However, if you chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount you chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale. Include this amount on line 12.   \\xa0 Other sales or dispositions of section 1250 property. For each sale of property held more than 1 year (for which an entry wasn\\'t made in Part I of Form 4797), figure the smaller of (a) the depreciation allowed or allowable or (b) the total gain for the sale. This amount is the smaller of line 22 or line 24 of Form 4797 for that property. Then, reduce that amount by any section 1250 ordinary income recapture for the sale. This is the amount from line 26g of Form 4797 for that property. The result is the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale. Include this amount on line 12.     \\xa0 Line 18c—28% Rate Gain  \\xa0 28% Rate Gain Worksheet—Line 18c                  1.

Collectibles  include works of art, rugs, antiques, metals (such as gold, silver, and platinum bullion), gems, stamps, coins, alcoholic beverages, and certain other tangible property. Also include gain (but not loss) from the sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership, S corporation, or trust held for more than 1 year that is attributable to the unrealized appreciation of collectibles.

For tax year 2019, the section 199A deduction isn\\'t included in the amount reported on line 1. To figure your adjusted alternative minimum taxable income, any section 199A deduction taken on line 20 of Form 1041 must be included as a negative amount on line 21.   ESBT reporting. The instructions have been updated to include directions for Electing small business trusts (ESBTs). See Line 1 Adjusted total income or (loss), later.   AMT tax brackets. The threshold for the 28% AMT tax bracket increased to amounts over $194,800.   AMT exemption amount and phaseout. The AMT exemption amount increased to $25,000. The exemption amount begins to be phased-out at amounts over $83,500 and is completely phased-out at $183,500.    Capital gains and qualified dividends. For tax year 2019, the 20% maximum capital gains rate applies to estates and trusts with income above $12,950. The 0% and 15% rates continue to apply to certain threshold amounts. The 0% rate applies to amounts up to $2,650. The 15% rate applies to amounts over $2,650 and up to $12,950.    Biofuel producer credit and biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit. Recent legislation extended these credits. These credits are available for tax years 2018 and 2019. If claiming any of these credits for tax year 2019, you may also need to make an adjustment on line 21. See Line 21 Other Adjustments, later. If claiming any of these credits for tax year 2018, file an amended return, which may also include making an adjustment (as explained in Line 21—Other Adjustments) on line 23 of the 2018 Schedule I (Form 1041).     \\xa0 Reminders  Opportunity zone exclusion. You may need to make an adjustment to the capital gain you deferred from income for regular tax as a result of investing in a qualified opportunity fund. See Line 11 Disposition of Property, later.    Excess business loss limitation. You may need to make an adjustment to the amount you included in income for regular tax as a result of this limitation when determining alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI). See Excess business loss limitation, later.   Business interest limitation. You may need to make an adjustment to the amount of business interest you deducted for regular tax as a result of this limitation when determining AMTI. See Business interest limitation, later.        General Instructions    \\xa0 Purpose of Schedule Use Schedule I (Form 1041) to figure:    The estate\\'s or trust\\'s alternative minimum taxable income;   The income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis; and   The estate\\'s or trust\\'s alternative minimum tax (AMT).    \\xa0 ESBTs. An ESBT must figure the AMT for the S and non-S portions of the trust on separate Schedules I (Form 1041). The Schedule I for each portion includes only the income, deductions, and credits attributable to that portion.   \\xa0 Who Must Complete Schedule I (Form 1041) \\xa0    Complete Parts I and II if the estate or trust is required to complete Form 1041, Schedule B, Income Distribution Deduction.   Complete Schedule I if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of alternative minimum taxable income (Part I, line 27) exceeds $25,000.   Complete Schedule I if the estate or trust claims any general business credit and line 6 of Part I or line 3 of Part III of Form 3800, General Business Credit, is more than zero.   ESBTs. Complete Schedule I if the alternative minimum taxable income (Part I, line 27) of the S portion of the trust is more than zero or the S portion of the trust claims any general business credit and line 6 of Part I or line 3 of Part III of the Form 3800 is more than zero.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Recordkeeping Schedule I contains adjustments and tax preference items that are treated differently for regular tax and AMT purposes. If you, as fiduciary for the estate or trust, completed a form to figure an item for regular tax purposes, you may have to complete it a second time for AMT purposes. Generally, the difference between the amounts on the two forms is the AMT adjustment or tax preference item to enter on Schedule I. Except for Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit (Individual, Estate, or Trust), any additional form completed for AMT purposes doesn\\'t have to be filed with Form 1041. For regular tax purposes, some deductions and credits may result in carrybacks or carryforwards to other tax years. Examples are investment interest expense, a net operating loss deduction (NOLD), a capital loss, and the foreign tax credit. Because these items may be refigured for the AMT, the carryback or carryforward amount may be different for regular and AMT purposes. Therefore, you should keep records of these different carryforward and carryback amounts for the AMT and regular tax. The AMT carryforward will be important in completing Schedule I for 2020.   \\xa0 Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax Estates and trusts that paid AMT in 2018, or had a minimum tax credit carryforward from the 2018 Form 8801, Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax—Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, may be eligible for a minimum tax credit in 2019. See Form 8801.   \\xa0 Partners and Shareholders An estate or trust that is a partner in a partnership or a shareholder in an S corporation must take into account its share of items of income and deductions that enter into the computation of its adjustments and tax preference items.   \\xa0 Allocation of Deductions to Beneficiaries The distributable net alternative minimum taxable income (DNAMTI) of the estate or trust doesn\\'t include amounts of depreciation, depletion, and amortization that are allocated to the beneficiaries, just as the distributable net income of the estate or trust doesn\\'t include these items for regular tax purposes. Report separately in box 12 of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), Beneficiary\\'s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc., any adjustments or tax preference items attributable to accelerated depreciation (code G), depletion (code H), and amortization (code I) that were allocated to the beneficiaries.   \\xa0 Optional Write-Off for Certain Expenditures There is no AMT adjustment for the following items if the estate or trust elects to deduct them ratably over the period of time shown for the regular tax.    Circulation expenditures—3 years (section 173).   Research and experimental expenditures—10 years (section 174(a)).   Intangible drilling costs—60 months (section 263(c)).   Mining exploration and development costs—10 years (sections 616(a) and 617(a)).    \\xa0 The election must be made in the year the expenditure was made and may be revoked only with IRS consent. See section 59(e) and Regulations section 1.59-1 for more details.       Specific Instructions    \\xa0 ESBTs. Use a separate Schedule I (Form 1041) to figure the AMT for the S portion of the trust. Add the notation “ESBT” to the top of the Schedule I and attach it to the tax computation attachment for Form 1041. See the ESBT Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041.  \\xa0 Where these instructions refer to completing other forms and worksheets, you must complete separate forms and worksheets for the S and non-S portions of the trust. Where necessary, add an \"ESBT\" notation at the top of the form or worksheet to show it relates to the computation for the S portion of the trust.  \\xa0 Part I—Estate\\'s or Trust\\'s Share of Alternative Minimum Taxable Income  \\xa0 Line 1—Adjusted total income or (loss) Adjusted total income or (loss) (from Form 1041, line 17 or ESBT Tax Worksheet, line 13). See the ESBT Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041.   \\xa0 Line 2—Interest In determining the alternative minimum taxable income, qualified residence interest (other than qualified housing interest defined in section 56(e)) isn\\'t allowed. If you completed Form 4952, Investment Interest Expense Deduction, for regular tax purposes, you may have an adjustment on this line. Refigure your investment interest expense on a separate AMT Form 4952 as follows.  Step 1. On line 1 of the AMT Form 4952, follow the instructions for that line, but also include the following amounts.    Any qualified residence interest (other than qualified housing interest) that was paid or accrued on a loan or part of a loan that is allocable to property held for investment as defined in section 163(d)(5) (for example, interest on a home equity loan whose proceeds were invested in stocks or bonds).   Any interest that would have been deductible if interest on specified private activity bonds had been included in income. See the instructions for line 7 for the definition of specified private activity bonds.    \\xa0   Step 2. On line 2, enter the AMT disallowed investment interest expense from 2018.   Step 3. When completing Part II of the AMT Form 4952, refigure gross income from property held for investment, any net gain from the disposition of property held for investment, net capital gain from the disposition of property held for investment, and any investment expenses, taking into account all AMT adjustments and tax preference items that apply. Include any interest income and investment expenses from private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986. When completing line 4g of the AMT Form 4952, enter the smaller of:    The amount from line 4g of the regular tax Form 4952, or   The total of lines 4b and 4e of the AMT Form 4952.    \\xa0   Step 4. Complete Part III. Enter on Schedule I, line 2 the difference between line 8 of the AMT Form 4952 and line 8 of the regular tax Form 4952. If the AMT deduction is greater, enter the difference as a negative amount.    \\xa0 Line 3—Taxes Enter any state or local real property taxes; state or local personal property taxes; state and local general sales taxes; and any state, local, or foreign income taxes that were included on Form 1041, page 1, line 11.   \\xa0 Line 4—Refund of Taxes Enter any refunds received in 2019 of taxes described for line 3 above and included in income. Also, include foreign real property taxes that were deducted in years prior to 2019, but refunded in 2019 and included in income on Form 1041.   \\xa0 Line 5—Depletion Refigure the depletion deduction for AMT purposes by using only the income and deductions allowed for the AMT when refiguring the limit based on taxable income from the property under section 613(a) and the limit based on taxable income, with certain adjustments, under section 613A(d)(1). Also, the depletion deduction for mines, wells, and other natural deposits under section 611 is limited to the property\\'s adjusted basis at the end of the year, as refigured for the AMT, unless the estate or trust is an independent producer or royalty owner claiming percentage depletion for oil and gas wells. Figure this limit separately for each property. When refiguring the property\\'s adjusted basis, take into account any AMT adjustments made this year or in previous years that affect basis (other than the current year\\'s depletion). Enter on line 5 the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction. If the AMT deduction is more than the regular tax deduction, enter the difference as a negative amount.   \\xa0 Line 6—Net Operating Loss Deduction Enter any NOLD from line 15b of page 1 of the Form 1041 as a positive amount.   \\xa0 Line 7—Interest From Specified Private Activity Bonds Exempt From the Regular Tax Enter the interest earned from specified private activity bonds reduced (but not below zero) by any deduction that would have been allowable if the interest were includible in gross income for regular tax purposes. Each payer of this type of interest should send a Form 1099-INT, Interest Income, to the estate or trust showing the amount of this interest in box 9. Generally, specified private activity bonds are any qualified bonds (as defined in section 141) issued after August 7, 1986, and before 2009 or after 2010, the interest on which isn\\'t includible in gross income for the regular tax. See section 57(a)(5) for more information. Don’t include interest on qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone bonds described in section 1400N(a) or qualified Midwestern disaster area bonds. Exempt-interest dividends paid by a regulated investment company are treated as interest from specified private activity bonds to the extent the dividends are attributable to interest on the bonds received by the company, minus an allocable share of the expenses paid or incurred by the company in earning the interest. This amount should also be reported to the estate or trust on Form 1099-DIV in box 12.   \\xa0 Line 8—Qualified Small Business Stock If the estate or trust claimed the exclusion under section 1202 for gain on qualified small business stock acquired before September 28, 2010, and held more than 5 years, multiply the excluded gain (as shown on Form 8949 in column (g)) by 7% (.07). Enter the result on line 8 as a positive amount.   \\xa0 Line 9—Exercise of Incentive Stock Options For regular tax purposes, no income is recognized when an incentive stock option (as defined in section 422(b)) is exercised. However, this rule doesn\\'t apply for AMT purposes. Instead, the estate or trust must generally include on line 9 the excess, if any, of:    The fair market value (FMV) of the stock acquired through exercise of the option (determined without regard to any lapse restriction) when its rights in the acquired stock first become transferable or when these rights are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, over   The amount paid for the stock, including any amount paid for the option used to acquire the stock.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Even if the estate\\'s or trust\\'s rights in the stock aren\\'t transferable and are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, you may elect to include in AMT income the excess of the stock\\'s FMV (determined without regard to any lapse restriction) over the exercise price upon the transfer to the estate or trust of the stock acquired through exercise of the option. See section 83(b) for more details. The election must be made no later than 30 days after the date of transfer. If the estate or trust acquired stock by exercising an option and it disposed of that stock in the same year, the tax treatment under the regular tax and the AMT is the same, and no adjustment is required. Increase the AMT basis of any stock acquired through the exercise of an incentive stock option by the amount of the adjustment.  Note. If a Form 3921, Exercise of an Incentive Stock Option Under Section 422(b), was received, it may help you figure the adjustment.    \\xa0 Line 10—Other Estates and Trusts If the estate or trust is the beneficiary of another estate or trust, enter the adjustment for minimum tax purposes from box 12, code A, Schedule K-1 (Form 1041). ESBTs. Enter an amount on this line only if the S corporation was a beneficiary of an estate or trust, received a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) from the estate or trust with an entry in box 12, code A, and the S corporation allocated a portion of the box 12, code A amount to the ESBT. See Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S), box 15, code F.   \\xa0 Line 11—Disposition of Property Use this line to report any AMT adjustment related to the disposition of property resulting from refiguring:    Gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property reported on Form 4797, Sales of Business Property;   Casualty gain or loss to business or income-producing property reported on Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts;   Ordinary income from the disposition of property not taken into account in 1 or 2 above or on any other line on Schedule I, such as a disqualifying disposition of stock acquired in a prior year by exercising an incentive stock option; and   Capital gain or loss (including any carryover that is different for the AMT) reported on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets, or Schedule D (Form 1041), Capital Gains and Losses.  \\xa0 The $3,000 capital loss limitation for the regular tax applies separately for the AMT.    \\xa0 First, figure any ordinary income adjustment related to 3, earlier. Then, refigure Form 4684, Form 4797, Form 8949, and Schedule D (Form 1041) for the AMT, if applicable, by taking into account any adjustments you made this year or in previous years that affect the estate\\'s or trust\\'s basis or otherwise result in a different amount for AMT. When you refigure your gain or loss on Form 8949 for AMT, the amount of gain you elected to defer for regular tax purposes due to an investment in a qualified opportunity fund may need to be adjusted on your AMT Form 8949. An adjustment may be required if the regular tax and AMT adjusted basis of the property you sold prior to your investment is different. If the estate or trust has a capital loss after refiguring Schedule D for the AMT, apply the $3,000 capital loss limitation separately to the AMT loss. For each of the four items listed above, figure the difference between the amount included in taxable income for the regular tax and the amount included in income for the AMT. Treat the difference as a negative amount if (a) both the AMT and regular tax amounts are zero or more and the AMT amount is less than the regular tax amount or (b) the AMT amount is a loss, and the regular tax amount is a smaller loss, or zero or more. Enter on line 11 the combined adjustments for the four items earlier.   \\xa0 Line 12—Depreciation on Assets Placed in Service After 1986 This section describes when depreciation must be refigured for the AMT and how to figure the amount to enter on line 12. Don’t include on this line any depreciation adjustment from:    An activity for which the estate or trust isn\\'t at risk or income or loss from a partnership or an S corporation if the basis limitations under section 704(d) or 1366(d) apply. Take this adjustment into account on line 14;   A tax shelter farm activity. Take this adjustment into account on line 21; or   A passive activity. Take this adjustment into account on line 13.    \\xa0  What depreciation must be refigured for the AMT? Generally, you must refigure depreciation for the AMT, including depreciation allocable to inventory costs, for:     Property placed in service after 1998 that is depreciated for the regular tax using the 200% declining balance method (generally 3-, 5-, 7-, or 10-year property under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS), except for certain qualified property eligible for the special depreciation allowance (discussed later)),    Section 1250 property placed in service after 1998 that isn\\'t depreciated for the regular tax using the straight line method, and   Tangible property placed in service after 1986 and before 1999. If the transitional election was made under section 203(a)(1)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, this rule applies to property placed in service after July 31, 1986.    \\xa0   What depreciation isn\\'t refigured for the AMT? Don’t refigure depreciation for the AMT for the following items.     Residential rental property placed in service after 1998.   Nonresidential real property with a class life of 27.5 years or more placed in service after 1998 that is depreciated for the regular tax using the straight line method.   Other section 1250 property placed in service after 1998 that is depreciated for the regular tax using the straight line method.   Property (other than section 1250 property) placed in service after 1998 that is depreciated for the regular tax using the 150% declining balance method or the straight line method.   Property for which you elected to use the alternative depreciation system (ADS) of section 168(g) for the regular tax.   Qualified property that is or was eligible for the special depreciation allowance if the depreciable basis of the property for the AMT is the same as for the regular tax. This applies to any special depreciation allowance, including those for qualified disaster assistance property, qualified reuse and recycling property, qualified cellulosic biofuel plant property, qualified New York Liberty Zone property, qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property, and Kansas disaster area qualified recovery assistance property. The special allowance is deductible for the AMT, and there also is no adjustment required for any depreciation figured on the remaining basis of the qualified property if the depreciable basis of the property for the AMT is the same as for the regular tax. Property for which an election is in effect to not have the special allowance apply isn\\'t qualified property. In addition, if you elect not to have any special depreciation allowance apply, the property may be subject to an AMT adjustment for depreciation if it was placed in service before 2016. It is not subject to an AMT adjustment for depreciation if it was placed in service after 2015.    Motion picture films, videotapes, or sound recordings.   Property depreciated under the unit-of-production method or any other method not expressed in a term of years.   Qualified Indian reservation property.   A natural gas gathering line placed in service after April 11, 2005.    \\xa0   How is depreciation refigured for the AMT? See methods below.  \\xa0 Property placed in service before 1999. Refigure depreciation for the AMT using ADS with the same convention used for the regular tax. See the table below for the method and recovery period to use.   \\xa0         Property Placed in Service Before 1999     IF the property is... THEN use the...   Section 1250 property. Straight line method over 40 years.   Tangible property (other than section 1250 property) depreciated using straight line for the regular tax. Straight line method over the property\\'s AMT class life.   Any other tangible property. 150% declining balance method, switching to straight line the first tax year it gives a larger deduction, over the property\\'s AMT class life.     \\xa0  \\xa0 Property placed in service after 1998. Use the same convention and recovery period used for the regular tax. For property other than section 1250 property, use the 150% declining balance method, switching to straight line the first tax year it gives a larger deduction. For section 1250 property, use the straight line method.    How is the AMT class life determined? The class life used for the AMT isn\\'t necessarily the same as the recovery period used for the regular tax. The class lives for the AMT are listed in Rev. Proc. 87-56, 1987-2 C.B. 674, and in Pub. 946, How To Depreciate Property. Use 12 years for any tangible personal property not assigned a class life.  \\xa0 See Pub. 946 for optional tables that can be used to figure AMT depreciation. Rev. Proc. 89-15, 1989-1 C.B. 816, has special rules for short tax years and for property disposed of before the end of the recovery period.   How is the line 12 adjustment figured? Subtract the AMT deduction for depreciation from the regular tax deduction and enter the result. If the AMT deduction is more than the regular tax deduction, enter the difference as a negative amount. In addition to the AMT adjustment to your deduction for depreciation, you must also adjust the amount of depreciation that was capitalized, if any, to account for the difference between the rules for the regular tax and the AMT. Include on this line the current year adjustment to taxable income, if any, resulting from the difference.    \\xa0 Line 13—Passive Activities  \\xa0 Don’t enter again elsewhere on this schedule any AMT adjustment or tax preference item included on this line. For AMT purposes, the rules described in section 469 apply, except that in applying the limitations, minimum tax rules apply. Refigure passive activity gains and losses on an AMT basis. Refigure a passive activity gain or loss by taking into account all AMT adjustments or tax preference items that pertain to that activity. You may complete a second Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations, to determine the passive activity losses allowed for AMT purposes, but don\\'t send this AMT Form 8582 to the IRS. Enter the difference between the loss reported for regular tax purposes and the AMT loss, if any.  \\xa0 The amount of any passive activity loss that isn\\'t deductible (and is therefore carried forward) for AMT purposes is likely to differ from the amount (if any) that is carried forward for regular tax purposes. Therefore, it is essential that you retain adequate records for both AMT and regular tax purposes.  Publicly traded partnerships (PTPs). If the estate or trust had a loss from a PTP, refigure the loss using any AMT adjustments, tax preference items, and any AMT prior year unallowed loss.    \\xa0 Line 14—Loss Limitations  \\xa0 If the loss is from a passive activity, use line 13 instead. If the loss is from a tax shelter farm activity (that isn\\'t passive), use line 21. Refigure your allowable losses for AMT purposes from activities for which you aren\\'t at risk and basis limitations applicable to interests in partnerships and stock in S corporations by taking into account your AMT adjustments and tax preference items. See sections 59(h), 465, 704(d), and 1366(d). Enter the difference between the loss reported for regular tax purposes and the AMT loss. If the AMT loss is more than the loss reported for regular tax purposes, enter the adjustment as a negative amount.   \\xa0 Line 15—Circulation Costs  \\xa0 Don’t make this adjustment for expenditures for which you elected the optional 3-year write-off period for regular tax purposes. Circulation expenditures deducted under section 173(a) for regular tax purposes must be amortized for AMT purposes over 3 years beginning with the year the expenditures were paid or incurred. Enter the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction. If the AMT deduction is greater, enter the difference as a negative amount. If the estate or trust had a loss on property for which circulation expenditures haven\\'t been fully amortized for the AMT, the AMT deduction is the smaller of (a) the amount of the loss allowable for the expenditures had they remained capitalized or (b) the remaining expenditures to be amortized for the AMT.   \\xa0 Line 16—Long-Term Contracts For AMT purposes, the percentage of completion method of accounting described in section 460(b) generally must be used. However, this rule doesn\\'t apply to any home construction contract (as defined in section 460(e)(6)).  Note. Contracts described in section 460(e)(1)(B) are subject to the simplified method of cost allocation of section 460(b)(4).  \\xa0 Enter the difference between the AMT and regular tax income. If the AMT income is smaller, enter the difference as a negative amount.   \\xa0 Line 17—Mining Costs  \\xa0 Don’t make this adjustment for costs for which you elected the optional 10-year write-off period under section 59(e) for regular tax purposes. Expenditures for the development or exploration of a mine or certain other mineral deposits (other than an oil, gas, or geothermal well) deducted under sections 616(a) and 617(a) for regular tax purposes must be amortized for AMT purposes over 10 years beginning with the year the expenditures were paid or incurred. Enter the difference between the amount allowed for AMT purposes and the amount allowed for regular tax purposes. If the amount allowed for AMT purposes exceeds the amount deducted for regular tax purposes, enter the difference as a negative amount. If the estate or trust had a loss on property for which mining expenditures haven\\'t been fully amortized for the AMT, the AMT deduction is the smaller of (a) the amount of the loss allowable for the expenditures had they remained capitalized or (b) the remaining expenditures to be amortized for the AMT.   \\xa0 Line 18—Research and Experimental Costs  \\xa0 Don’t make this adjustment for costs paid or incurred in connection with an activity in which the estate or trust materially participated under the passive activity rules or for costs for which you elected the optional 10-year write-off for research and experimental expenditures under section 59(e) for regular tax purposes. Research and experimental expenditures deducted under section 174(a) for regular tax purposes generally must be amortized for AMT purposes over 10 years beginning with the year the expenditures were paid or incurred. Enter the difference between the amount allowed for AMT purposes and the amount allowed for regular tax purposes. If the amount for AMT purposes exceeds the amount allowed for regular tax purposes, enter the difference as a negative amount. If the estate or trust had a loss on property for which research and experimental costs haven\\'t been fully amortized for the AMT, the AMT deduction is the smaller of (a) the loss allowable for the costs had they remained capitalized or (b) the remaining costs to be amortized for the AMT.   \\xa0 Line 19—Income From Certain Installment Sales Before January 1, 1987 The installment method doesn\\'t apply for AMT purposes to any nondealer disposition of property that occurred after August 16, 1986, but before the first day of your tax year that began in 1987, if an installment obligation to which the proportionate disallowance rule applied arose from the disposition. Enter on line 19 the amount of installment sale income that was reported for regular tax purposes.   \\xa0 Line 20—Intangible Drilling Costs Preference (IDCs)  \\xa0 Don’t make this adjustment for costs for which you elected the optional 60-month write-off under section 59(e) for regular tax purposes. IDCs from oil, gas, and geothermal wells are a preference to the extent that the excess IDCs exceed 65% of the net income from the wells. Figure the preference for all oil and gas properties separately from the preference for all geothermal properties. Figure excess IDCs as follows:    Determine the amount of the estate\\'s or trust\\'s IDCs allowed for the regular tax under section 263(c), but don’t include any section 263(c) deduction for nonproductive wells, then   Subtract the amount that would have been allowed had you amortized these IDCs over a 120-month period starting with the month the well was placed in production.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Cost depletion can be substituted for the amount allowed using amortization over 120 months.  Net income. Determine net income by reducing the gross income that the estate or trust received or accrued during the tax year from all oil, gas, and geothermal wells by the deductions allocable to those wells (reduced by the excess IDCs). When refiguring net income, use only income and deductions allowed for the AMT.   Exception. The preference for IDCs from oil and gas wells doesn\\'t apply to taxpayers who are independent producers (that is, not integrated oil companies as defined in section 291(b)(4)). However, this benefit may be limited. First, figure the IDC preference as if this exception didn\\'t apply. For purposes of this exception, complete and combine lines 1 through 21, including the IDC preference. If the amount of the IDC preference exceeds 40% of the total of lines 1 through 21, enter the excess on line 20 (the benefit of this exception is limited). Otherwise, don’t enter an amount on line 20 (the estate\\'s or trust\\'s benefit from this exception isn\\'t limited).    \\xa0 Line 21—Other Adjustments Enter on line 21 the total of any other adjustments that apply including the following.    Section 199A deduction. Include as a negative amount on line 21 the section 199A deduction shown on Form 1041, line 20.  \\xa0 ESBTs. Don\\'t include any section 199A deduction taken on line 11, Qualified business income deduction (S portion), of your ESBT Tax Worksheet on line 21 when figuring your adjusted alternative minimum taxable income for the S portion of your trust. This amount is already included on line 1, Adjusted total income or (loss), from line 13 of your ESBT Tax Worksheet.   Depreciation figured using pre-1987 rules. For AMT purposes, use the straight line method to figure depreciation on real property. Use a recovery period of 19 years for 19-year real property and 15 years for low-income housing. Enter the excess of depreciation claimed for regular tax purposes over depreciation refigured using the straight line method. Figure this amount separately for each property and include on line 21 only positive amounts. For leased personal property other than recovery property, enter the amount by which the regular tax depreciation using the pre-1987 rules exceeds the depreciation allowable using the straight line method. For leased 10-year recovery property and leased 15-year public utility property, enter the amount by which the depreciation deduction determined for regular tax purposes is more than the deduction allowable using the straight line method with a half-year convention, no salvage value, and a recovery period of 15 years (22 years for 15-year public utility property). Figure this amount separately for each property and include on line 21 only positive amounts.   Amortization of pollution control facilities. The amortization deduction under section 169 must be refigured for the AMT. For facilities placed in service after 1986 and before 1999, figure the amortization deduction for the AMT using the ADS described in section 168(g). For facilities placed in service after 1998, figure the AMT deduction under MACRS using the straight line method. Enter the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction. If the AMT amount is greater, enter the difference as a negative amount.   Tax shelter farm activities. Figure this adjustment only if the tax shelter farm activity (as defined in section 58(a)(2)) isn\\'t a passive activity. If the activity is passive, include it with any other passive activities on line 13. Refigure all gains and losses reported for the regular tax from tax shelter farm activities by taking into account any AMT adjustments and preferences. Determine tax shelter farm activity gain or loss for the AMT using the same rules used for the regular tax with the following modifications. No refigured loss is allowed, except to the extent an estate or trust is insolvent (see section 58(c)(1)). A refigured loss may not be used in the current tax year to offset gains from other tax shelter farm activities. Instead, any refigured loss must be suspended and carried forward indefinitely until (a) the estate or trust has a gain in a subsequent tax year from the same activity or (b) the activity is disposed of. The AMT amount of any tax shelter farm activity loss that isn\\'t deductible and is carried forward is likely to differ from the regular tax amount. Keep adequate records for both the AMT and regular tax. Enter the difference between the amount that would be reported for the activity on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Supplemental Income and Loss, or Schedule F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Profit or Loss From Farming, for the AMT and the regular tax amount. If (a) the AMT loss is more than the regular tax loss, (b) the AMT gain is less than the regular tax gain, or (c) there is an AMT loss and a regular tax gain, then enter the adjustment as a negative amount. Enter any adjustment for amounts reported on Form 8949, Schedule D (Form 1041), Form 4684, or Form 4797 for the activity on line 11 instead of line 21.   Biofuel producer credit and biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit. If the adjusted total income (Form 1041, line 17) includes the amount of the biofuel producer credit or biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit, include that amount as a negative amount on line 21.  Note. Recent legislation extended the biofuel producer credit and biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit. The credit is available for 2018 and 2019. If you are eligible for this benefit for tax year 2018, you will need to file an amended Form 1041 return to claim it.    Related adjustments. AMT adjustments and tax preference items may affect deductions that are based on an income limit other than adjusted gross income (AGI) or modified AGI (for example, farm conservation expenses). Refigure these deductions using the income limit as modified for the AMT. Include the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction on line 21. If the AMT deduction is more than the regular tax deduction, include the difference as a negative amount.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Don’t make an adjustment on line 21 for an item you refigured on another line of Schedule I (for example, line 5).   Excess business loss limitation. Complete an AMT Form 461 using amounts adjusted for AMT. Enter the difference between the AMT and regular tax limitation on losses. If line 16 of the AMT Form 461 is less than the amount on line 16 of the regular tax Form 461, enter the difference as a negative amount.   ATNOL carryover. Keep your AMT Form 461 for your records because you will carry over the amount you figure on line 16 of your 2019 AMT Form 461 to 2020 and include it when figuring your ATNOLD.    Note. Your disallowed AMT excess business loss (figured on an AMT Form 461) for a year is treated as an ATNOL carryover to the following year, even if you wouldn’t otherwise have an ATNOL for that year. Your ATNOL carryover to 2019 will include the amount you figured on line 16 of your 2018 AMT Form 461. You may need to complete a 2018 AMT Form 461 if you weren’t required to file Schedule I (Form 1041) in 2018.   Business interest limitation. Complete an AMT Form 8990 using amounts adjusted for AMT. Enter the difference between the AMT and regular tax allowable interest expense. If line 30 of the AMT Form 8990 is more than the amount on line 30 of the regular tax Form 8890, enter the difference as a negative amount.   \\xa0 Line 22—Alternative Tax Net Operating Loss Deduction The ATNOLD is the sum of the alternative tax net operating loss (ATNOL) carryovers and carrybacks to the tax year (including an ATNOL carryover resulting from a disallowed AMT excess business loss), subject to the limitation explained below. The net operating loss (NOL) under section 172(c) is modified for alternative tax purposes by (a) taking into account the adjustments made under sections 56 and 58 and (b) reducing the NOL by any item of tax preference under section 57. For an estate or trust that held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), figure the ATNOLD without regard to any excess inclusion. If this estate or trust is the beneficiary of another estate or trust that terminated in 2019, include any ATNOL carryover that was reported in box 11, code E of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041). The estate\\'s or trust\\'s ATNOLD may be limited. To figure the ATNOLD limitation, first figure alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) without regard to the ATNOLD. For this purpose, figure a tentative amount for line 5 of Schedule I (Form 1041) by treating line 22 as if it were zero. Then, figure a tentative total by combining lines 1–21 of Schedule I (Form 1041) using the line 5 tentative amount. The ATNOLD limitation is 90% of the result. However, the 90% limit doesn\\'t apply to an ATNOL that is attributable to qualified disaster losses (as defined in section 172(j)), qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone losses as defined in section 1400N(k)(2), qualified recovery assistance losses (as defined in Pub. 4492-A, Information for Taxpayers Affected by the May 4, 2007, Kansas Storms and Tornadoes), qualified disaster recovery assistance losses (as defined in Pub. 4492-B, Information for Affected Taxpayers in the Midwestern Disaster Areas) or a 2008 or 2009 loss that you elected to carryback more than 2 years under section 172(b)(1)(H). If an ATNOL that is carried back or carried forward to a tax year is attributable to any of those losses, the ATNOLD for the tax year is limited to the sum of:    The smaller of:    The sum of the ATNOL carrybacks and carryforwards to the tax year attributable to NOLs other than the losses described in 2a below, or   90% of AMTI for the tax year (figured without regard to the ATNOLD), plus      The smaller of:    The sum of the ATNOL carrybacks and carryforwards to the tax year attributable to qualified disaster losses, qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone losses, qualified recovery assistance losses, qualified disaster recovery assistance losses, and any 2008 or 2009 loss that you elected to carry back more than 2 years under section 172(b)(1)(H), or   100% of AMTI for the tax year (figured without regard to the ATNOLD) reduced by the amount determined under 1, above.       \\xa0 Enter on line 22 the smaller of the ATNOLD or the ATNOLD limitation. Any ATNOL not used generally may be carried back 2 years or forward up to 20 years if it arose before your 2018 tax year. Any ATNOL arising after your 2017 tax year generally may be carried forward indefinitely. For more information, see Pub. 536, Net Operating Losses (NOLs) for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts. The treatment of ATNOLs doesn\\'t affect your regular tax NOL.  \\xa0 If you elected under section 172(b)(3) to forego the carryback period for regular tax purposes, the election will also apply for the AMT.   \\xa0 Line 27—Estate\\'s or Trust\\'s Share of Alternative Minimum Taxable Income For an estate or trust that held a residual interest in a REMIC, line 27 may not be less than the estate\\'s or trust\\'s share of the amount on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 38, column (c). If that amount is larger than the amount you would otherwise enter on line 27, enter that amount instead and write \"Sch. Q\" on the dotted line next to line 27.   ESBTs. Enter the amount from line 27 on line 49, and go to line 50.    \\xa0 Part II—Income Distribution Deduction on a Minimum Tax Basis  \\xa0 ESBTs. Do not complete Part II.  \\xa0 Line 28—Adjusted Alternative Minimum Taxable Income  \\xa0 The section 199A deduction is not included in the distributable net alternative taxable income (DNAMTI). The section 199A deduction must be added back to the amount from line 23, Schedule I to calculate the income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis. Generally, enter on line 28, Schedule I, the amount from line 23, Schedule I plus the amount of the section 199A deduction, if any. However, if Form 1041, page 1, line 4 and line 23, Schedule I (after adding back the section 199A deduction) are losses, enter on line 28 the smaller of those losses. If Form 1041, line 4 is zero or a gain and line 23, Schedule I is a loss (after adding back the section 199A deduction), enter zero on line 28.   \\xa0 Line 29—Adjusted Tax-Exempt Interest To figure the adjusted tax-exempt interest (including exempt-interest dividends received as a shareholder in a mutual fund or other regulated investment company), subtract the total of any:    Tax-exempt interest from Form 1041, Schedule A, line 2 figured for AMT purposes, and   Section 212 expenses allowable for AMT purposes allocable to tax-exempt interest, from the amount of tax-exempt interest received.    \\xa0 Don’t subtract any deductions reported on lines 2 and 3, Schedule I (Form 1041). Section 212 expenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt interest are allocated only to tax-exempt interest. A reasonable proportion of section 212 expenses that are indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt interest and other income must be allocated to each class of income.   \\xa0 Line 31 Reduce the amount on line 31 by any allocable section 1202 exclusion (as refigured for AMT purposes).   \\xa0 Line 32 Enter any capital gains that were paid or permanently set aside for charitable purposes from the current year\\'s income included on line 1 of Form 1041, Schedule A. Reduce the amount on line 32 by any allocable section 1202 exclusion (as refigured for AMT purposes).   \\xa0 Lines 33 and 34 Capital gains and losses must take into account any basis adjustments from line 11, Part I of Form 1041 (Schedule I).   \\xa0 Line 39—Adjustment for Tax-Exempt Income In figuring the income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis, the estate or trust isn\\'t allowed a deduction for any item of DNAMTI (line 35) that isn\\'t included in the gross income of the estate or trust figured on an AMT basis. Thus, for purposes of figuring the allowable income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis, the DNAMTI is figured without regard to any tax-exempt interest (except for amounts from line 7). If tax-exempt interest is the only tax-exempt income included in the total distributions (line 38), and the DNAMTI (line 35) is less than or equal to line 38, then enter on line 39 the amount from line 29. If tax-exempt interest is the only tax-exempt income included in the total distributions (line 38), and the DNAMTI is more than line 38 (that is, the estate or trust made a distribution that is less than the DNAMTI), then figure the adjustment by multiplying line 29 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total distributions (line 38), and the denominator of which is the DNAMTI (line 35). Enter the result on line 39. If line 38 includes tax-exempt income other than tax-exempt interest (except for amounts from line 7), figure line 39 by subtracting the total expenses allocable to tax-exempt income that are allowable for AMT purposes from tax-exempt income included on line 38. Expenses that are directly allocable to tax-exempt income are allocated only to tax-exempt income. A reasonable proportion of expenses indirectly allocable to both tax-exempt income and other income must be allocated to each class of income.   \\xa0 Line 42—Income Distribution Deduction on a Minimum Tax Basis Allocate the income distribution deduction figured on a minimum tax basis among the beneficiaries in the same manner as income was allocated for regular tax purposes. You need the allocated income distribution deduction figured on a minimum tax basis to figure the beneficiary\\'s adjustment for minimum tax purposes, as explained under Box 12–Alternative minimum tax (AMT) items in the Schedule K-1 instruction section of the Instructions for Form 1041 and Schedules A, B, G, J, and K-1.    \\xa0 Part III—Alternative Minimum Tax Computation  \\xa0 Line 51—Alternative Minimum Foreign Tax Credit  \\xa0 To see if you need to figure the estate\\'s or trust\\'s AMT foreign tax credit, fill in line 53 of Schedule I as instructed. If the amount on line 53 is greater than or equal to the amount on line 50, the estate or trust doesn\\'t owe the AMT. Enter zero on line 54 and see Who Must Complete earlier to find out if you must file Schedule I with Form 1041. However, even if the estate or trust doesn\\'t owe AMT, you may need to complete line 51 to see if you have an AMT foreign tax credit carryback or carryforward to other tax years. To figure the AMT foreign tax credit, follow the steps discussed below.  Step 1. Complete and attach a separate AMT Form 1116, with the notation at the top \"Alt Min Tax\" for each separate limitation category specified at the top of Form 1116.  Note. When applying the separate limitation categories, use the applicable AMT rate instead of the regular tax rate to determine if any income is \"high-taxed.\"   \\xa0   Step 2. If you (on behalf of the estate or trust) previously made or are making the Simplified limitation election (as discussed later), skip Part I and enter on the AMT Form 1116, line 17, the same amount you entered on that line for the regular tax. If you didn\\'t complete Form 1116 for the regular tax and you previously made or are making the simplified limitation election (on behalf of the estate or trust), complete Part I and lines 15 through 17 of the AMT Form 1116 using regular tax amounts. If the election doesn\\'t apply, complete Part I, using only income and deductions allowed for the AMT that are attributable to sources outside the United States. If the estate or trust has any foreign source qualified dividends or foreign source capital gains or losses, use the instructions under Step 3 to determine whether you must make adjustments to those amounts before you include the amounts on line 1a or line 5 of the AMT Form 1116.   Step 3. Follow the instructions below, if applicable, to determine the amount of foreign source qualified dividends and foreign source capital gains and losses to include on line 1a and line 5 of the AMT Form 1116.  \\xa0 Foreign qualified dividends. You must adjust the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source qualified dividends before you include those amounts on line 1a of the AMT Form 1116 if:     Line 60 of Schedule I (Form 1041) is greater than zero,   Line 81 of Schedule I (Form 1041) is smaller than line 82, and   The exception for foreign qualified dividends below doesn\\'t apply.    \\xa0 But, you don’t need to make any adjustments if:    The estate or trust qualifies for the adjustment exception under Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet (Estates and Trusts) or Schedule D Filers in the Instructions for Form 1116 and   Line 60 of Schedule I (Form 1041) isn\\'t more than $194,800.    \\xa0  Note. Use the estate\\'s or trust\\'s capital gains and losses as refigured for the AMT to determine whether your total amounts are less than the $20,000 threshold under the adjustment exception.  \\xa0  To adjust foreign source qualified dividends, multiply the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source qualified dividends in each separate category by 0.5357 if the foreign source qualified dividends are taxed at a rate of 15%. Include the results on line 1a of the AMT Form 1116. If they are taxed at a rate of 20%, multiply your foreign source qualified dividends in each separate category by 0.7143. Include the results on line 1a of the AMT Form 1116. You adjust the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source qualified dividends taxed at the 0% rate by not including them on line 1a of Form 1116. Amounts taxed at the 0% rate are on line 8 of the Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041, line 30 of Schedule D (Form 1041), or line 19 of the Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041).  \\xa0 Don’t adjust the amount of any foreign source qualified dividends you elected to include on line 4g of the AMT Form 4952.  \\xa0 Foreign capital gains or losses. If any capital gain or loss from U.S. or foreign sources is different for the AMT, use the refigured amounts to complete this step. To figure the adjustment for the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source capital gains or losses, you must first determine whether you can use Worksheet A or Worksheet B in the Instructions for Form 1116. Otherwise, you must use the instructions for Capital Gains and Losses in Pub. 514, Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals, to figure the adjustments you must make to the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source capital gains and losses. Use Worksheet A if the estate or trust has foreign source capital gains or losses in no more than two separate categories, and any of the following apply.     You weren\\'t required to make adjustments to the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source qualified dividends under the rules described earlier (or if the estate or trust had foreign source qualified dividends, you wouldn’t have been required to make those adjustments).   Schedule D (Form 1041), line 18a, column (2) or line 19, column (2), as refigured for the AMT if necessary, is zero or a loss.   On the AMT Schedule D Tax Worksheet for Form 1041, (a) line 17a is zero, (b) line 9 is zero, or (c) line 42 is equal to or greater than line 43.   On the AMT Part V of Schedule D (Form 1041), a) line 22 of that AMT Part V minus the amount on Form 4952, line 4e, that you elected to include on Form 4952, line 4g, is zero or less, b) line 27 of that AMT Part V of Schedule D (Form 1041) is zero, or c) line 43 of that AMT Part V is equal to or greater than line 44.    \\xa0 Use Worksheet B if you:     Can’t use Worksheet A,   Have foreign source capital gains and losses in no more than two separate categories,   Didn’t have any item of unrecaptured section 1250 gain or any item of 28% rate gain or loss for either regular tax or AMT, and    Didn’t have any capital gains taxed at a rate of 0% or 20%.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Instructions for Worksheets A and B. When you complete Worksheet A or B, use foreign source capital gains and losses as refigured for the AMT, if necessary, and don’t use any foreign source capital gains that you elected to include on line 4g of the AMT Form 4952. If you must complete a Schedule D (Form 1041) for the AMT, use line 19 of that AMT Schedule D (Form 1041) to complete line 3 of Worksheet A or line 4 of the Line 2 Worksheet for Worksheet B. Use 0.5357 instead of the number used for regular tax to complete lines 11, 13, and 15 of Worksheet B and to complete lines 8, 11, and 17 of the Line 15 Worksheet for Worksheet B. If the estate or trust doesn\\'t qualify to use Worksheet A or Worksheet B, use the instructions for Capital Gains and Losses in Pub. 514 to determine the adjustments you make. When using the instructions in Pub. 514 to determine if you must adjust foreign source capital gains and losses, make the following substitutions.    When the amount of any AMT gain is in the 15% rate group, multiply it by 0.5357 instead of the number used for regular tax.   When the amount of any AMT gain is in the 20% rate group, multiply it by 0.7143 instead of the number used for regular tax.   When the amount of any AMT gain is in the 25% rate group, multiply it by 0.8929 instead of the number used for regular tax.   When the amount of any AMT gain is in the 28% rate group, multiply it by 1.0 instead of the number used for regular tax.    \\xa0    Step 4. Complete Part II and lines 9 through 14 of the AMT Form 1116. Use the estate\\'s or trust\\'s AMT foreign tax credit carryover, if any, on line 10.   Step 5. If the simplified limitation election doesn\\'t apply, complete lines 15 through 17 of the AMT Form 1116.   Step 6. If you didn\\'t complete Part IV of Schedule I (Form 1041), enter the amount from Schedule I (Form 1041), line 27 on line 18 of the AMT Form 1116 and go to Step 7 later. If you completed Part IV of Schedule I (Form 1041), complete an AMT Worksheet for Line 18 in the Instructions for Form 1116 to figure the amount to enter on Form 1116, line 18, if:     Line 60 of Schedule I (Form 1041) is greater than zero, and   Line 81 of Schedule I (Form 1041) is smaller than line 82.    \\xa0 But you don’t need to complete the Worksheet for Line 18 if:   Note. Use the estate\\'s and trust\\'s capital gains and losses as refigured for the AMT to determine if its total amounts are less than the $20,000 threshold under the adjustment exception.    The estate or trust qualifies for the adjustment exception discussed in the Instructions for Form 1116 and   Line 60 of Schedule I (Form 1041) isn\\'t more than $194,800.    \\xa0 If you don’t have to complete an AMT Worksheet for Line 18, enter the amount from line 27 of Schedule I on line 18 of the AMT Form 1116.  \\xa0 Instructions for completing an AMT Worksheet for Line 18. To complete an AMT Worksheet for Line 18 in the Instructions for Form 1116, follow these instructions.     Enter the amount from Schedule I (Form 1041), line 27 on line 1 of the worksheet.   Skip lines 2 and 3 of the worksheet.   Enter the amount from Schedule I (Form 1041), line 79 on line 4 of the worksheet.   Multiply line 4 of the worksheet by 0.1071 (instead of the number used for regular tax) and enter the results on line 5 of the worksheet.   Enter the amount from Schedule I (Form 1041), line 76 on line 6 of the worksheet.   Multiply line 6 of the worksheet by 0.2857 (instead of the number used for regular tax) and enter the result on line 7 of the worksheet.   Enter the amount from Schedule I (Form 1041), line 73 on line 8 of the worksheet.   Multiply line 8 of the worksheet by 0.4643 (instead of the number used for regular tax). Enter the result on line 9 of the worksheet.   Enter the amount from Schedule I, line 66, on line 10 of the worksheet.   Complete lines 11 and 12 of the worksheet as instructed on the worksheet.    \\xa0    Step 7. Enter the amount from Schedule I (Form 1041), line 50 on the AMT Form 1116, line 20. Complete lines 19, 21, and 22 of the AMT Form 1116.   Step 8. Complete Part IV of the first AMT Form 1116 only. Enter on line 51 of Schedule I the amount from line 33 of the first AMT Form 1116. Attach to the estate\\'s or trust\\'s return all AMT Forms 1116 you used to figure your AMT foreign tax credit.   AMT foreign tax credit carryback and carryforward. If the AMT foreign tax credit is limited, any unused amount can be carried back or forward under section 904(c). The election to forego the carryback period for regular tax purposes also applies for the AMT.   Simplified limitation election. The estate or trust may elect to use a simplified section 904 limitation to figure its AMT foreign tax credit. To do so, use the estate\\'s or trust\\'s regular tax income for Form 1116, Part I, instead of refiguring the estate\\'s or trust\\'s foreign source income for the AMT, as described in Step 2 in the instructions for line 51, earlier. The estate or trust must make the election for the first tax year after 1997 for which it claims an AMT foreign tax credit. If it doesn\\'t make the election for that year, it may not make it for a later year. Once made, the election applies to all later tax years and may be revoked only with IRS consent.    \\xa0 Line 53—Tax ESBTs. Enter the tax shown on line 14a of the ESBT Tax Worksheet (minus any foreign tax credit from line 15a of the ESBT worksheet).   \\xa0 Line 54—Alternative Minimum Tax ESBTs. Enter the amount shown on line 14b of the ESBT Tax Worksheet.    \\xa0 Part IV—Line 50 Computation Using Maximum Capital Gains Rates  \\xa0 Lines 56, 57, and 58 If you used Schedule D (Form 1041), the Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041), or the Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041, you generally may enter the amounts as instructed on Schedule I, lines 56, 57, and 58. But don’t use those amounts if any of the following apply.    The gain or loss from any transaction reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D (Form 1041) is different for the AMT (for example, because the AMT basis was different due to depreciation adjustments or an incentive stock option adjustment or the AMT capital loss carryover from 2018 was different).   You didn\\'t complete Part V of Schedule D (Form 1041), the Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041), or the Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041 because Form 1041, line 23 or line 13 of the EBST Tax Worksheet, was zero or less.   The estate or trust received a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) that shows an amount in box 12 with code B, C, D, E, or F. If this applies, see If the estate or trust is a beneficiary of another estate or trust, later.    \\xa0 If 1 above applies, complete an AMT Form 8949. Next, if 1 or 3 applies, complete Parts I through IV of an AMT Schedule D (Form 1041) by refiguring the amounts of your gains and losses for the AMT. Then, if 1, 2, or 3 applies, complete the following lines of the applicable schedule or worksheet:    Lines 22 through 26 of an AMT Schedule D (Form 1041),   Lines 2 through 13 of an AMT Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041), or   Lines 2 through 4 of a Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041.    If you were required to complete an AMT Form 4952, use it to figure the amount to enter on line 25 of the AMT Schedule D (Form 1041), lines 3 and 4 of the AMT Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041), and line 3 of the Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet. Use amounts from the AMT Schedule D (Form 1041), AMT Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1041) or Qualified Dividends Tax Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1041 to complete Schedule I (Form 1041), lines 56, 57, and 58. Keep the AMT Form 8949, AMT Schedule D (Form 1041) and applicable AMT worksheet for your records, but don’t attach any of them to Form 1041.  \\xa0 Don’t decrease the estate\\'s or trust\\'s section 1202 exclusion by the amount, if any, included on line 8 of Schedule I (Form 1041) .  If the estate or trust is a beneficiary of another estate or trust. If the estate or trust received a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) from another estate or trust that shows an amount in box 12 with code B, C, D, E, or F, follow the instructions in the table below.          IF the code in box 12 is... THEN include that amount in the total on...

It also includes income in respect of a decedent (IRD), which isn\\'t included in box 1, 2a, 3, 4a, 6, 7, or 8.   \\xa0    Boxes 6 through 8—Ordinary Business Income, Net Rental Real Estate Income, and Other Rental Income    The fiduciary will provide you with a separate schedule showing your distributive share of income from each trade or business, net rental real estate, or other rental activity. Any losses reported in boxes 6 through 8 may be subject to the passive loss limitations of section 469, which generally limits deducting passive losses only from passive activity income. The rules for applying these limitations to beneficiaries haven\\'t yet been issued. For more details, see Pub. 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.   \\xa0    Box 9—Directly Apportioned Deductions    The fiduciary must attach a statement showing depreciation, depletion, and amortization directly apportioned to you, if any, for each activity reported in boxes 5 through 8.   \\xa0    Box 10—Estate Tax Deduction (Including Certain Generation-Skipping Transfer Taxes)    If an estate or trust distributes income in respect of a decedent (IRD) to a beneficiary, the beneficiary is entitled to deduct the portion of the estate tax imposed on the decedent\\'s estate which is attributable to the IRD distributed to the beneficiary. You may claim this amount on line 16 of Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). For an example of how this amount was computed, see Regulations section 1.691(c)-2 and Pub. 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators.   \\xa0    Box 11, Code A—Excess Deductions on Termination    If this is the final return of the estate or trust, and there are excess deductions on termination, you may be able to deduct the beneficiary’s share of the excess deductions on line 16 of Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).  Note. Section 67(g) suspends miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor for tax years 2018 through 2025. See Notice 2018–61 for information about allowable beneficiary deductions under section 67(e) and 642(h). For any additional updates, please go to IRS.gov/Form1041.  Excess deductions on termination occur only during the last tax year of the trust or decedent’s estate when the total deductions (excluding the charitable deduction and exemption) are greater than the gross income during that tax year. Only the beneficiary of an estate or trust that succeeds to its property is allowed to deduct that entity’s excess deductions on termination. A beneficiary who doesn’t have enough income in that year to absorb the entire deduction can’t carry the balance over to any succeeding year.   \\xa0     Box 11, Codes B and C—Unused Capital Loss Carryover    Upon termination of the trust or decedent’s estate, the beneficiary succeeding to the property is allowed to deduct any unused capital loss carryover under section 1212. A short-term capital loss carryover, reported as code B, is reported on Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 5. A long-term capital loss carryover, reported as code C, is reported, as appropriate, on Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 12; line 5 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet for Schedule D, line 18; and line 16 of the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet for Schedule D, line 19.   \\xa0     Box 11, Codes D and E—NOL Carryover    Upon termination of a trust or decedent’s estate, a beneficiary succeeding to its property is allowed to deduct any unused net operating loss (NOL) if the carryover would be allowable to the trust or estate in a later tax year but for the termination. The deduction for regular tax purposes, reported as code D, is reported on Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 8. A deduction for an Alternative Tax NOL (ATNOL) carryover for Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) purposes, reported as code E, is reported on Form 6251, line 2f.   \\xa0    Box 12—Alternative Minimum Tax Items    The information reported in box 12, codes A through I is used to prepare your Form 6251. Code A, Adjustment for minimum tax purposes, is the total amount reported on Form 6251, line 2j. Codes B through F represent the portion, if any, of the amount included in code A.   Codes B through F. If you have an amount in box 12 with code B, C, D, E, or F, see the instructions for lines 13, 14, and 15 of Form 6251.   Codes G through I. Include the amount with any of these codes on the applicable line of Form 6251.   Code J. Exclusion items. If you pay alternative minimum tax in 2019, the amount in box 12, code J, will help you figure any minimum tax credit for 2020. See the 2020 Form 8801, Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax—Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, for more information.   \\xa0    Box 13—Credits and Credit Recapture    Codes A through Q, and code Z, list all the credits that may be allocated to you as a beneficiary. Generally, you must file the source credit form along with Form 3800, General Business Credit, to claim the general business credits listed on Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), codes C through Q, and code Z. However, if your only source for the credits listed on Form 3800, Part III, is from pass-through entities, you may not be required to complete the source credit form. Instead, you may be able to report the credit directly on Form 3800. See below for the instructions for specific credits.  Code A. Credit for estimated taxes. The beneficiary treats this amount as a payment of estimated tax. To figure any underpayment and penalty on Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, treat the amount entered in box 13, code A, as an estimated tax payment made on January 15, 2020.   Note. Form 1041-T, Allocation of Estimated Tax Payments to Beneficiaries, must be timely filed by the fiduciary for the beneficiary to get the credit for an estimated tax payment.   Code B. Credit for backup withholding. Include this amount on line 17 of your Form 1040 or 1040-SR and attach a copy of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) to your return.   Code C. Low-income housing credit. The fiduciary will provide you with a statement showing the amount to report on lines 4 and 11 of Form 8586.

Code E. Other qualifying investment credit. This code is used to report the qualified investment for figuring the qualifying advanced coal project credit, the qualifying gasification project credit, and the qualifying advanced energy project credit. The fiduciary must provide you with a statement that shows the information you will need and where to report it on Form 3468 so that you can figure the amount of the previously listed credits that you may claim.   Code H. Biofuel producer credit. See the Instructions for Form 6478 for more information. If your only source for the credit is a pass-through entity, such as an estate or trust, you can report the amount on Form 3800, Part III, line 4c.    Code J. Renewable electricity, refined coal, and Indian coal production credit. The fiduciary must provide you with a statement showing the amount of credit to report on Form 8835, line 19 (including the allocation of the credit for production during the 4-year period beginning on the date the facility was placed in service and for production after that period). If your only source for the credit is a pass-through entity, you can report the amount from line 19 directly on Form 3800, Part III, lines 1f and 4e, as applicable. Otherwise, complete Form 8835 as directed.   Code O. Biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit. If this credit includes the small agri-biodiesel producer credit, the fiduciary will provide additional information on an attached statement.

This code is used to report the beneficiary’s share of the employee retention credit. For more information on the employee retention credit, see the Instructions for Form 5884-A. If your only source for the employee retention credit is a pass-through entity, such as an estate or trust, you can report the amount directly on Form 3800, Part III, line 1aa.    \\xa0    Box 14—Other Information     Code F. Gross farming and fishing income. The amount of farming and fishing income is included in box 6. This income is separately stated to help determine if you are subject to a penalty for underpayment of estimated tax. Report the amount of gross farming and fishing income on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Supplemental Income and Loss, line 42.    Code H. Net investment income tax. This amount is the beneficiary\\'s adjustment for section 1411 net investment income or deductions. Enter this amount on line 7 of Form 8960, as applicable. See the Instructions for Form 8960.   Code I. Section 199A information. Generally, you may be allowed a deduction of up to 20% of your apportioned net qualified business income plus 20% of your apportioned qualified REIT dividends, also known as section 199A dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income from the trust or estate. The trust or estate will provide the information you need to help figure your deduction. Once you have this information, you will use one of two forms to help you figure your qualified business income deduction. \\xa0    Use Form 8995, Qualified Business Income Deduction Simplified Computation, if: \\ta) You have qualified business income, section 199A dividends, or PTP income (defined below); \\tb) Your 2019 taxable income before the qualified business income deduction is equal to or less than $160,700 ($321,400 if married filing jointly or $160,725 if married filing separately); and \\tc) You aren’t a patron in a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative.    Use Form 8995-A, Qualified Business Income Deduction, if you don’t meet all three of these requirements.     \\xa0   \\xa0 Qualified business income pass-through entity reporting information. Using the information provided to you by the trust or estate, complete the appropriate form as identified above.   \\xa0 QBI or Qualified PTP items subject to beneficiary-specific determinations. The amounts reported to you reflect your apportioned pro rata share of items from the trust or estate’s trade(s) or business(es), or aggregation(s) and may include items that aren’t includible in your calculation of the QBI deduction. When determining QBI or qualified PTP income, you must include only those items that are qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss included or allowed in determining taxable income for the tax year. To determine your QBI or your qualified PTP income amounts and for information on where to report them, see the Instructions for Form 8995 or Form 8995-A, as applicable.   \\xa0 W-2 wages. The amounts reported reflect your apportioned pro rata share of the trust or estate’s W-2 wages allocable to the QBI of each qualified trade or business, or aggregation. See the Instructions for Form 8995 or Form 8995-A, as applicable.   \\xa0 UBIA of qualified property. The amounts reported reflect your apportioned pro rata share of the trust or estate’s unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property of each qualified trade or business, or aggregation. See the Instructions for Form 8995 or Form 8995-A, as applicable.   \\xa0 Section 199A dividends. The amount reported reflects your apportioned pro rata share of the trust or estate’s net section 199A dividends. See the Instructions for Form 8995 or Form 8995-A, as applicable.   \\xa0 Patrons of specified agricultural and horticultural cooperatives. If the trust or estate was a patron of an agricultural or horticultural cooperative (Specified Cooperative), you must use Form 8995-A to figure your QBI deduction. In addition, you must complete Schedule D (Form 8995-A) to determine your patron reduction.   \\xa0 QBI items allocable to qualified payments from specified cooperatives subject to beneficiary-specific determinations. The amounts reported to you reflect your apportioned pro rata share of items from the trust or estate’s trade(s) or business(es), or aggregation(s) and include items that may not be includible in your calculation of the QBI deduction and patron reduction. When determining QBI items allocable to qualified payments you must include only qualified items that are included or allowed in determining taxable income for the tax year. To determine your QBI items allocable to qualified payments see the Instructions for Form 8995-A.   \\xa0 Wages allocable to qualified payments from specified cooperatives. The amounts reported reflect your apportioned pro rata share of the trust or estate’s W-2 wages allocable to qualified payments of each qualified trade or business, or aggregation. See the Instructions for Form 8995-A.   \\xa0 Section 199A(g) deduction from specified cooperatives. The amount reported reflects your apportioned pro rata share of the trust or estate’s net section 199A(g) deduction. See the Instructions for Form 8995-A.   Code Z. Other information. If this code is used, the fiduciary will provide you with any additional information you may need to file your return that isn\\'t shown elsewhere on this Schedule K-1. If you receive a statement regarding the splitting of foreign tax credits from the income to which it relates, section 909 may prevent you from deducting the foreign tax credit until the related foreign income is taken into account. See Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit, and Pub. 514, Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals, for more information.  The fiduciary will provide you the information that you need to figure your section 951A income. Report your section 951A income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 8, or the comparable line of your income tax return. For details, see the Instructions for Form 8992. Your distributive share of the net amount of section 965(a) inclusion less the corresponding section 965(c) deduction should be reported in box 14, code Z. In addition, the fiduciary will provide a statement detailing your distributive share of the section 965(a) inclusion, the section 965(c) deduction, and any section 960 deemed paid foreign tax credits related to your distributive share of the section 965(a) inclusion (relevant to corporate beneficiaries and individual beneficiaries electing to be taxed as a corporation on gross income under section 951(a), including such gross income by reason of section 965).  The domestic production activities deduction (DPAD) was repealed for tax years beginning after 2017, with limited exceptions. If your tax year begins after 2017, and you are a recipient of the DPAD from an estate or trust with a tax year beginning before 2018, the DPAD can be taken. See Form 8903, Domestic Productions Activities Deduction, and its instructions for details. If any of the income is oil-related qualified production activities income (QPAI), the fiduciary must give you a statement that shows the amount. Enter the oil-related amount on Form 8903, line 7, col. (a). Enter the total amount of QPAI on Form 8903, line 7, col.(b). If an estate or trust is required to file Form 8990, the adjusted taxable income of an estate or trust beneficiary is reduced by any income (including any distributable net income) received from the estate or trust by the beneficiary to the extent such income supported a deduction for business interest expense under section 163(j)(1)(B) in computing the estate\\'s or trust\\'s taxable income. If applicable, the fiduciary will provide you the necessary information to calculate this amount in an attachment to Schedule K-1.      ',\n",
       " '   Instructions for Form 8941 (2019)  Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    2019        Instructions for Form 8941 - Introductory Material       Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 8941 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form8941.   \\xa0 Reminders  Exception for eligible small employers in certain counties. Certain small employers whose principal business address is in a county with no qualified health plan through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace may be able to claim the credit for small employer health insurance premiums. For more information, see Exception for eligible small employers in certain counties in the instructions for line A.   Waiver for Hawaii. Employers in Hawaii can’t claim this credit for insurance premiums paid for health plan years beginning after 2016. For more information, see Waiver for Hawaii in the instructions for line A.       General Instructions    \\xa0 Purpose of Form Eligible small employers (defined below) use Form 8941 to figure the credit for small employer health insurance premiums for tax years beginning after 2009. For tax years beginning after 2013, the credit is only available for a 2-consecutive-tax-year credit period. The maximum credit is generally a percentage of premiums the employer paid during the tax year for certain health insurance coverage the employer provided to certain employees enrolled in a qualified health plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace. But the credit may be reduced by limitations based on the employer’s full-time equivalent employees, average annual wages, adjusted average premiums, and state premium subsidies and tax credits.  \\xa0 For information about insurance plans offered through a SHOP Marketplace, visit Healthcare.gov. For tax-exempt eligible small employers, the maximum credit is 35% of premiums paid, is limited to the amount of certain payroll taxes paid, and is claimed as a refundable credit on Form 990-T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return. A tax-exempt eligible small employer is an eligible small employer described in section 501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a). A tax-exempt employer not described in section 501(c) is generally not eligible to claim this credit. However, a tax-exempt farmers’ cooperative subject to tax under section 1381 may be able to claim the credit as a general business credit, as discussed next. For all other eligible small employers, the maximum credit is 50% of premiums paid, can be taken against both regular and alternative minimum tax, and is claimed as part of the general business credit on Form 3800.  \\xa0 Partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, trusts, and tax-exempt eligible small employers must file this form to claim the credit. All other taxpayers must not complete or file this form if their only source for this credit is a partnership, S corporation, cooperative, estate, or trust. Instead, they must report this credit directly on line 4h in Part III of Form 3800, General Business Credit.   \\xa0 Eligible Small Employers You’re an eligible small employer for the tax year if you meet the following three requirements.  1. You paid premiums for employee health insurance coverage under a qualifying arrangement. A qualifying arrangement is generally an arrangement that requires you to pay a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium cost for each enrolled employee’s health insurance coverage (defined later). However, an arrangement that requires you to pay a uniform premium for each enrolled employee (composite billing) and offers different tiers of coverage (for example, employee-only, dependent, and family coverage) can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for employees not enrolled in employee-only coverage. In addition, an arrangement that requires you to pay a separate premium for each employee based on age or other factors (list billing) can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for some employees. For details, see Employer Premiums Paid, Health Insurance Coverage, and Qualifying Arrangement, later.   2. You had fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) for the tax year. You may be able to meet this requirement even if you had 25 or more employees. For details, see Worksheets 1 and 2.  \\xa0 Although the term \"eligible small employer\" is defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include employers with \"no more than\" 25 FTEs, the phaseout of the credit amount operates in such a way that an employer with exactly 25 FTEs is not in fact eligible for the credit.    3. You paid average annual wages for the tax year of less than $55,000 per FTE. For details, see Worksheets 1 and 3.   \\xa0 If you had more than 10 FTEs and average annual wages of more than $27,000, the FTE and average annual wage limitations (discussed later) will separately reduce your credit. This may reduce your credit to zero even if you had fewer than 25 FTEs and average annual wages of less than $55,000.  Employers treated as a single employer. Treat the following employers as a single employer to figure the credit.    Employers who are corporations in a controlled group of corporations.   Employers who are members of an affiliated service group.   Employers who are partnerships, proprietorships, etc., under common control. See Regulations sections 1.414(c)-2, 1.414(c)-3, and 1.414(c)-4.   Tax-exempt employers under common control. See Regulations section 1.414(c)-5.    \\xa0 For details, see section 45R(e)(5)(A) and Regulations section 1.45R-2(b).  \\xa0 No more than one Form 8941 can be filed with a tax return, unless the exception described in Example 2 below applies. \\xa0  Example 1. You’re a sole proprietor with two separate businesses and you file a separate Schedule C (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for each business. You must treat both businesses as a single employer to figure the credit. You will file one Form 8941 for both businesses.  \\xa0  Example 2. You and your spouse are both sole proprietors and file a separate Schedule C (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) for each of your separate businesses. Neither spouse was an employee of the other spouse or participated in the management of the other spouse’s business at any time during the tax year. No more than 50% of the gross income of either business was derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest, and annuities and you otherwise meet the requirements listed in Regulations section 1.414(c)-4(b)(5)(ii). Don’t treat both businesses as a single employer to figure the credit. If you and your spouse are both eligible small employers, you can file two Forms 8941 with a jointly filed Form 1040 or 1040-SR.  \\xa0    \\xa0 Credit Period For tax years beginning after 2013, the credit period during which the credit can be claimed is a 2-consecutive-tax-year period beginning with the first tax year in which:    An eligible small employer (or any predecessor) files an income tax return with an attached Form 8941 with line A checked \"Yes\" and a positive amount on line 12, or   A tax-exempt eligible small employer (or any predecessor) files Form 990-T with an attached Form 8941 with line A checked \"Yes\" and a positive amount on line 12.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Employer Premiums Paid Only premiums you paid for health insurance coverage under a qualifying arrangement (discussed later) for individuals considered employees are counted when figuring your credit.  State premium subsidy or tax credit. If you’re entitled to a state tax credit or a state premium subsidy paid directly to you for premiums you paid, don’t reduce the amount you paid by the credit or subsidy amount. Also, if a state pays a premium subsidy directly to your insurance provider, treat the subsidy amount as an amount you paid for employee health insurance coverage.   Wellness programs. A wellness program is generally an insurance program of health promotion or disease prevention. If you pay part or all of the cost of an employee’s participation in a wellness program, use the amount you paid to figure your employer premiums paid.   Tobacco surcharges. A tobacco surcharge is generally an additional amount charged for insurance for a tobacco user. If you pay part or all of an employee’s tobacco surcharge, you can’t use the amount you paid to figure your employer premiums paid.   Dependent coverage. Dependent coverage is generally coverage offered separately to an individual who is or may become eligible for coverage under the terms of a group health plan because of a relationship to a participant-employee, whether or not a dependent of the participant-employee. Dependent coverage doesn’t include coverage, such as family coverage, which includes coverage of the participant-employee. If you pay part or all of the cost of an employee’s dependent coverage, use the amount you paid to figure your employer premiums paid.   Portion of premiums paid. If you pay only a portion of the premiums and your employees pay the rest, only the portion you pay is taken into account. For this purpose, any premium paid through a salary reduction arrangement under a section 125 cafeteria plan isn’t treated as an employer paid premium. For more information on cafeteria plans, see section 1 of Pub. 15-B, Employer’s Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits.   Example 3. You offer health insurance coverage to employees under a qualifying arrangement that requires you to pay 60% of the premium cost for employee-only coverage for each employee enrolled in any health insurance coverage you provide to employees. The total premium for each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage is $5,200 per year or $100 ($5,200 ÷ 52) for each weekly payday. The total premium for each employee enrolled in family coverage is $13,000 per year or $250 ($13,000 ÷ 52) for each weekly payday. Each payday you contribute $60 (60% of $100) toward the premium cost of each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage and withhold the remaining $40 from the employee\\'s paycheck to obtain the $100 total weekly premium. Each payday you contribute $60 (the same amount you pay toward the premiums of employees enrolled in employee-only coverage) toward the premium cost of each employee enrolled in family coverage and withhold the remaining $190 from the employee’s paycheck to obtain the $250 total weekly premium. To determine the premiums you paid during the tax year, multiply the number of pay periods during which the employee was enrolled in the health insurance coverage by $60. For example, you would’ve paid $3,120 ($60 × 52) for an employee who was enrolled for the entire tax year. You would’ve paid $600 ($60 × 10) for an employee who was only enrolled for 10 pay periods. You will need an additional set of calculations if the premium amounts changed during the tax year.    \\xa0 Health Insurance Coverage For tax years beginning after 2013, health insurance coverage generally means coverage provided to employees enrolled in a qualified health plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace. For an exception that applies to certain employers in certain counties, see the instructions for line A, later. If this exception applies, health insurance coverage means coverage, as defined under Health Insurance Coverage in the 2013 Instructions for Form 8941.  \\xa0 A stand-alone dental plan offered through a SHOP exchange will be considered a qualified health plan for purposes of the credit.  \\xa0 Employer premiums paid for health insurance coverage can be counted in figuring the credit only if the premiums are paid under a qualifying arrangement.   \\xa0 Qualifying Arrangement A qualifying arrangement is generally an arrangement that requires you to pay a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium cost for each enrolled employee\\'s health insurance coverage (defined earlier). An arrangement that offers different tiers of coverage (for example, employee-only and family coverage) is generally a qualifying arrangement if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) separately for each tier of coverage you offer. However, an arrangement can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for some employees. For more information about the following exceptions, see Regulations section 1.45R-4.  State or local law. You will be treated as satisfying the uniform percentage requirement if your failure to otherwise satisfy the requirement was solely attributable to additional contributions you made to certain employees to comply with state or local law.   Wellness program. If a plan of an employer provides a wellness program, for purposes of meeting the uniform percentage requirement any additional amount of the employer contribution attributable to an employee’s participation in the wellness program over the employer contribution with respect to an employee that doesn’t participate in the wellness program isn’t taken into account in calculating the uniform percentage requirement, whether the difference is due to a discount for participation or a surcharge for nonparticipation. The employer contribution for employees who don’t participate in the wellness program must be at least 50% of the premium (including any premium surcharge for nonparticipation). However, for purposes of figuring the credit, the employer contributions are taken into account, including those contributions attributable to an employee’s participation in a wellness program.   Tobacco surcharge. Any additional amount you or your employee pay to cover a tobacco surcharge isn’t taken into account in figuring the uniform percentage requirement. Amounts you or your employee pay to cover a tobacco surcharge aren’t considered premiums paid for health insurance coverage when figuring this credit.   Dependent coverage. Premiums you pay for dependent coverage aren’t subject to the uniform percentage requirement. You aren’t required to pay a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) for dependent coverage.    Arrangements with composite billing. An arrangement that requires you to pay a uniform premium for each enrolled employee (composite billing) and offers different tiers of coverage can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for employees not enrolled in employee-only coverage. It is a qualifying arrangement (assuming employee-only coverage is the least expensive tier of coverage) if it requires you to pay the following amounts.    A uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium cost for each employee (if any) enrolled in employee-only coverage.   A uniform amount that is no less than the amount you would’ve paid toward employee-only coverage for each employee (if any) enrolled in family coverage.   A uniform amount that is no less than the amount you would’ve paid toward employee-only coverage for each employee (if any) enrolled in any other tier of coverage (figured separately for each tier).    \\xa0   Arrangements with list billing and only employee-only coverage. An arrangement that requires you to pay a separate premium for each employee based on age or other factors (list billing) that only provides employee-only coverage can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for some employees. It is a qualifying arrangement if it requires you to pay either of the following amounts.    A uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium charged for each employee enrolled in the employee-only coverage.   A uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of your employer-computed composite rate (defined later) for your employee-only coverage for each employee enrolled in the employee-only coverage.    \\xa0   Arrangements with list billing and other tiers of coverage. An arrangement that requires you to pay a separate premium for each employee based on age or other factors (list billing) that provides other tiers of coverage can be a qualifying arrangement even if it requires you to pay a uniform percentage that is less than 50% of the premium cost for some employees. It is a qualifying arrangement (assuming employee-only coverage is the least expensive tier of coverage) if it requires you to pay the following amounts.    A uniform percentage (not less than 50%) for each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage, as discussed under Arrangements with list billing and only employee-only coverage above.   A uniform amount that is either equal to the amount you would’ve paid toward employee-only coverage (as discussed above), a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium charged, or a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of your employer-computed composite rate (defined below) for your family coverage, for each employee (if any) enrolled in family coverage.   A uniform amount that is either equal to the amount you would’ve paid toward employee-only coverage (as discussed above), a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of the premium charged, or a uniform percentage (not less than 50%) of your employer-computed composite rate (defined below) for any other tier of coverage, for each employee (if any) enrolled in any other tier of coverage (figured separately for each tier).    \\xa0   Employer-computed composite rate. The employer-computed composite rate for a tier of coverage is the average rate determined by adding the premiums for that tier of coverage for all employees eligible to participate in the health insurance plan (whether or not they actually receive coverage under the plan or under that tier of coverage) and dividing by the total number of such eligible employees.   More than one plan. Different types of health insurance plans are generally not aggregated for purposes of meeting the qualifying arrangement requirement. For example, if you offer a major medical insurance plan and a stand-alone vision plan, you generally must separately satisfy the requirements for a qualifying arrangement with respect to each type of coverage. For exceptions, see Regulations section 1.45R-4(c).   State subsidies and credits. For this purpose, if you’re entitled to a state tax credit or a state premium subsidy paid directly to you for premiums you paid, don’t reduce the amount you paid by the credit or subsidy amount. Also, if a state pays a premium subsidy directly to your insurance provider, treat the subsidy amount as an amount you paid for employee health insurance coverage.    \\xa0 State Premium Subsidy and Tax Credit Limitation Your credit may be reduced if you’re entitled to a state tax credit or a state premium subsidy for the cost of health insurance coverage you provide under a qualifying arrangement to individuals considered employees. The state tax credit may be refundable or nonrefundable and the state premium subsidy may be paid to you or directly to your insurance provider. Although a state tax credit or premium subsidy paid directly to you doesn’t reduce the amount of your employer premiums paid, and although a state premium subsidy paid directly to an insurance provider is treated as an employer premium you paid, the amount of your credit can’t be more than your net premium payments. Net premium payments are employer premiums paid (discussed earlier) minus the amount of any state tax credits you received or will receive and any state premium subsidies paid either to you or directly to your insurance provider for premiums for health insurance coverage you provide under a qualifying arrangement to individuals considered employees.   \\xa0 Payroll Tax Limitation for Tax-Exempt Eligible Small Employers The credit for tax-exempt eligible small employers can’t exceed the amount of certain payroll taxes. For tax years beginning in 2019, payroll taxes, for this purpose, mean only the following taxes.    Federal income taxes the tax-exempt employer was required to withhold from employees’ wages in calendar year 2019.   Medicare taxes the tax-exempt employer was required to withhold from employees’ wages in calendar year 2019.   Medicare taxes the tax-exempt employer was required to pay for calendar year 2019.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Premium Deduction Reduced You must reduce your deduction for the cost of providing health insurance coverage to your employees by the amount of any credit for small employer health insurance premiums allowed with respect to the coverage.   \\xa0 More Information For more information about this credit, see the following.

You paid premiums for employee health insurance coverage you provided through a SHOP Marketplace or through a direct enrollment process, if available in your state.   You qualify for an exception to this requirement, as discussed below.    \\xa0 If you answer \"Yes\" because you paid premiums for employee health insurance coverage you provided through a SHOP Marketplace, enter the Marketplace identifier, if any. If you answer \"No,\" don’t file Form 8941 unless you’re filing it for a partnership, S corporation, cooperative, estate, trust, or tax-exempt eligible small employer that received from another entity a credit that must be reported on line 15. For more information, see the instructions for line 15.  Waiver for Hawaii. Hawaii has received a 5-year State Innovation Waiver under section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act. Employers in Hawaii can’t participate in the SHOP Marketplace or claim the credit for insurance premiums paid for health plan years beginning after 2016. For more information on the waiver, visit CMS.gov.   Exception for eligible small employers in certain counties. For calendar year 2019, SHOP Marketplaces in certain counties across the United States didn’t have qualified health plans available for employers to offer to employees. However, relief is available which allows eligible small employers with a principal business address in those counties to claim the credit for 2019 if they properly claimed the credit under section 45R for all or part of 2018. For details, see Notice 2018-27, 2018-20, I.R.B. 580, available at IRS.gov/irb/2018-20_IRB#NOT-2018-27.  \\xa0 To see whether a particular county has coverage available through a SHOP Exchange for 2019 and beyond, go to Healthcare.gov/small-business and enter \"plans and prices\" in the search box.    \\xa0 Line C Answer \"Yes\" if a tax return you (or any predecessor) filed for a tax year beginning in 2014, 2015, 2016, or 2017 included a Form 8941 with line A checked \"Yes\" and line 12 showing a positive amount. For more information, see Credit Period, earlier. If you answer \"Yes,\" don’t file Form 8941 unless you’re filing it for a partnership, S corporation, cooperative, estate, trust, or tax-exempt eligible small employer that received from another entity a credit that must be reported on line 15. An entity that qualifies for this exception shouldn’t report any amount on line 12. For more information, see the instructions for line 15.  \\xa0  Worksheet 1.

In general, all employees who perform services for you during the tax year are taken into account in determining your FTEs, average annual wages, and premiums paid. Rules that apply to certain types of employees are discussed below.  Excluded employees. The following individuals aren’t considered employees when you figure this credit. Hours and wages of these employees and premiums paid for them aren’t counted when you figure your credit.    The owner of a sole proprietorship.   A partner in a partnership.   A shareholder who owns (after applying the section 318 constructive ownership rules) more than 2% of an S corporation.   A shareholder who owns (after applying the section 318 constructive ownership rules) more than 5% of the outstanding stock or stock possessing more than 5% of the total combined voting power of all stock of a corporation that isn’t an S corporation.   A person who owns more than 5% of the capital or profits interest in any other business that isn’t a corporation.   Family members or a member of the household who isn’t a family member but qualifies as a dependent on the individual income tax return of a person listed above. Family members include a child (or descendant of a child), a sibling or step-sibling, a parent (or ancestor of a parent), a step-parent, a niece or nephew, an aunt or uncle, or a son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law. A spouse of any owner or family member listed above is also considered a family member for this purpose.    \\xa0   Former employees. Premiums paid on behalf of a former employee with no hours of service may be treated as paid on behalf of an employee for purposes of figuring the credit provided that, if so treated, the former employee is also treated as an employee for purposes of the uniform percentage requirement.    Leased employees. Don’t use premiums paid by the leasing organization to figure your credit. Also, a leased employee who isn’t a common law employee is considered an employee for credit purposes if he or she does all the following.    Provides services to you under an agreement between you and a leasing organization.   Has performed services for you (or for you and a related person) substantially full time for at least 1 year.   Performs services under your primary direction or control.    \\xa0 But don’t use hours, wages, or premiums paid with respect to the initial year of service on which leased employee status is based.   Seasonal employees. Employees who perform labor or services on a seasonal basis and perform labor or services for you 120 or fewer days during the tax year aren’t considered employees in determining FTEs and average annual wages. But premiums paid on their behalf are counted in determining the amount of the credit. Seasonal workers include retail workers employed exclusively during holiday seasons. Seasonal workers also include workers employed exclusively during the summer.   Household and other nonbusiness employees. Household employees and other employees who aren’t performing services in your trade or business are considered employees if they otherwise qualify, as discussed above. A sole proprietor must include both business and nonbusiness employees to determine FTEs, average annual wages, and premiums paid.   Ministers. A minister performing services in the exercise of his or her ministry is treated as self-employed for social security and Medicare purposes. However, for credit purposes, whether a minister is an employee or self-employed is determined under the common law test for determining worker status. Self-employed ministers aren’t considered employees.    \\xa0 Column (b), Employee Hours of Service Enter the total hours of service for the tax year for each employee listed in column (a). Don’t enter more than 2,080 hours for any employee. But enter -0- for seasonal employees who worked 120 or fewer days during the tax year.  Employee hours of service. An employee’s hours of service for a year include the following.    Each hour for which the employee is paid, or entitled to payment, for the performance of duties for the employer during the employer’s tax year.   Each hour for which an employee is paid, or entitled to payment, by the employer on account of a period of time during the employer’s tax year during which no duties are performed due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity (including disability), layoff, jury duty, military duty, or leave of absence (except that no more than 160 hours of service are required to be counted for an employee on account of any single continuous period during which the employee performs no duties).    \\xa0 To figure the total number of hours of service you must take into account for an employee for the year, you can use any of the following methods.  \\xa0 Actual-hours-worked method. Determine actual hours of service from records of hours worked and hours for which payment is made or due (payment is made or due for vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, etc., as described above).   \\xa0 Days-worked equivalency method. Use a days-worked equivalency whereby the employee is credited with 8 hours of service for each day for which the employee would be required to be credited with at least 1 hour of service under the rules described above.   \\xa0 Weeks-worked equivalency method. Use a weeks-worked equivalency whereby the employee is credited with 40 hours of service for each week for which the employee would be required to be credited with at least 1 hour of service under the rules described above.     \\xa0 Column (c), Employee Wages Paid  \\xa0 Complete Worksheet 2 before you complete column (c) of Worksheet 1. Do not complete column (c) if Worksheet 2, line 3, is 25 or more.  Enter the total wages paid for the tax year for each employee listed in column (a). But enter -0- for seasonal employees who worked 120 or fewer days during the tax year. Wages, for this purpose, mean wages subject to social security and Medicare tax withholding determined without considering any wage base limit. \\xa0  Worksheet 2. Information Needed To Complete Line 2 (FTEs)         \\xa0  Your credit is reduced if you had more than 10 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) for the tax year. If you had 25 or more FTEs for the tax year, your credit is reduced to zero.  \\xa0              1. Enter the total employee hours of service from Worksheet 1, column (b) 1. \\xa0   2. Hours of service per FTE 2. 2,080   3. Full-time equivalent employees. Divide line 1 by line 2. If the result isn’t a whole number (0, 1, 2, etc.), generally round the result down to the next lowest whole number. For example, round 2.99 down to 2. However, if the result is less than one, enter 1. Report this number on Form 8941, line 2 3. \\xa0      \\xa0 \\xa0  Worksheet 3. Information Needed To Complete Line 3 (Average Annual Wages)         \\xa0  Your credit is reduced if you paid average annual wages of more than $27,000 for the tax year. If you paid average annual wages of $55,000 or more for the tax year, your credit is reduced to zero.  \\xa0              1. Enter the total employee wages paid from Worksheet 1, column (c) 1. \\xa0   2. Enter FTEs from Worksheet 2, line 3 2. \\xa0   3. Average annual wages. Divide line 1 by line 2. If the result isn’t a multiple of $1,000 ($1,000, $2,000, $3,000, etc.), round the result down to the next lowest multiple of $1,000. For example, round $2,999 down to $2,000. Report this amount on Form 8941, line 3 3. \\xa0      \\xa0 \\xa0  Worksheet 4. Information Needed To Complete Lines 4, 5, and 13 and Worksheet 7         \\xa0  If you need more rows, use a separate sheet and include the additional amounts in the totals below.  \\xa0              (a) \\t\\t\\tEnrolled \\t\\t\\tIndividuals \\t\\t\\tConsidered \\t\\t\\tEmployees (b) \\t\\t\\tEmployer \\t\\t\\tPremiums \\t\\t\\tPaid (c) \\t\\t\\tAdjusted \\t\\t\\tAverage \\t\\t\\tPremiums (d) \\t\\t\\tEnrolled \\t\\t\\tEmployee \\t\\t\\tHours of \\t\\t\\tService     1. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   2. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   3. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   4. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   5. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   6. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   7. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   8. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   9. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   10. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   11. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   12. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   13. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   14. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   15. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   16. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   17. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   18. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   19. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   20. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   21. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   22. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   23. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   24. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   25. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0     Totals: \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0      \\xa0  \\xa0 Column (a), Enrolled Individuals Considered Employees Enter the name or other identifying information for each individual listed in column (a) of Worksheet 1 who was enrolled in health insurance coverage you provided to employees during the tax year under a qualifying arrangement. For details, see Health Insurance Coverage and Qualifying Arrangement, earlier.   \\xa0 Column (b), Employer Premiums Paid Enter the total employer premiums paid for the tax year for each employee listed in column (a). For details, see Employer Premiums Paid, earlier.   \\xa0 Column (c), Adjusted Average Premiums Your credit is reduced if the employer premiums paid are more than the employer premiums that would’ve been paid if individuals considered employees were enrolled in a plan with a premium equal to the average premium for the small group market in the rating area in which the employee enrolls for coverage. The rating area in which an employee enrolls for coverage is generally the rating area where your business is located (based on your primary business address). You will generally have selected a plan in your rating area that covers all employees located within or outside your rating area. However, if you have multiple businesses or operations in multiple states, and have set up plans in more than one SHOP Marketplace, the average premiums may be different for employees enrolled in each SHOP Marketplace. Enter, for each employee listed in column (a), the premiums you would’ve paid if the employee had enrolled in a plan or plans with a total premium equal to the average premium for the small group market in the rating area in which the employee enrolls for coverage. To find the average premium for the small group market in a rating area for tax years beginning in 2019, see the average premium tables at the end of these instructions. Family coverage includes any coverage other than employee-only coverage.  Example 4. Assume the same facts that were used in Example 3. The $60 you contribute each payday toward employee health insurance coverage is 60% ($60 ÷ $100) of the weekly premium for each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage and 24% ($60 ÷ $250) of the weekly premium for each employee enrolled in family coverage. In this situation, the total average premium limitation amounts that apply are 60% of the applicable average premium amounts for each employee enrolled in employee-only coverage and 24% of the applicable average premium amounts for each employee enrolled in family coverage. You have an employee enrolled in employee-only coverage who enrolled for coverage in your local rating area. The applicable employee-only average premium amount for the rating area is $4,940 or $95 ($4,940 ÷ 52) for each weekly payday. The amount you would’ve paid toward this employee’s health insurance coverage based on the average premiums is $57 (60% of $95) each payday. To determine the premiums you would’ve paid for this employee during the tax year if the employee had enrolled in an average premium plan, multiply the number of pay periods during which your employee was enrolled in the health insurance coverage by $57. For example, you would’ve paid $2,964 ($57 × 52) if the employee was enrolled for the entire tax year. You would’ve paid $570 ($57 × 10) if the employee was only enrolled for 10 pay periods. You’ll need an additional set of calculations if the premium amounts changed during the tax year.    \\xa0 Column (d), Enrolled Employee Hours of Service  \\xa0 Don’t complete column (d) of Worksheet 4 if Form 8941, line 12, is zero. Enter the amount from column (b) of Worksheet 1 for each employee listed in column (a) of Worksheet 4. \\xa0  Worksheet 5.

Multiply line 2 by line 5 6. \\xa0   7. Subtract line 6 from line 1. Report this amount on Form 8941, line 9 7. \\xa0      \\xa0   \\xa0 Line 10 Enter the total amount of any state premium subsidies paid and any state tax credits available to you for premiums included on line 4. For details, see State Premium Subsidy and Tax Credit Limitation, earlier. \\xa0  Worksheet 7. Information Needed To Complete Line 14 (If Line 12 is More Than Zero)           1. Enter the total enrolled employee hours of service from Worksheet 4, column (d) 1. \\xa0   2. Hours of service per FTE 2. 2,080   3. Divide line 1 by line 2. If the result isn’t a whole number (0, 1, 2, etc.), generally round the result down to the next lowest whole number. For example, round 2.99 down to 2. However, if the result is less than one, enter 1. Report this number on Form 8941, line 14 3. \\xa0      \\xa0   \\xa0 Line 15 Enter any credit for small employer health insurance premiums from:    Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), box 15 (code P);   Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S), box 13 (code P);   Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 13 (code G); and   Form 1099-PATR, Taxable Distributions Received From Cooperatives, box 11, or other notice of credit allocation.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, trusts, and tax-exempt eligible small employers report the above credits on line 15. All other filers figuring a separate credit on earlier lines also report the above credits on line 15. All others not using earlier lines to figure a separate credit must report the above credits directly on Form 3800, Part lll, line 4h.  \\xa0 Line 17  Cooperatives. A cooperative described in section 1381(a) must allocate to its patrons the credit in excess of its tax liability. Therefore, to figure the unused amount of the credit allocated to patrons, the cooperative must first figure its tax liability. While any excess is allocated to patrons, any credit recapture applies as if the cooperative had claimed the entire credit. If the cooperative is subject to the passive activity rules, include on line 15 any credit for small employer health insurance premiums from passive activities disallowed for prior years and carried forward to this year. Complete Form 8810, Corporate Passive Activity Loss and Credit Limitations, to determine the allowed credit that must be allocated to patrons. For details, see the Instructions for Form 8810.   Estates and trusts. Allocate the credit on line 16 between the estate or trust and the beneficiaries in the same proportion as income was allocated and enter the beneficiaries’ share on line 17. If the estate or trust is subject to the passive activity rules, include on line 15 any credit for small employer health insurance premiums from passive activities disallowed for prior years and carried forward to this year. Complete Form 8582-CR, Passive Activity Credit Limitations, to determine the allowed credit that must be allocated between the estate or trust and the beneficiaries. For details, see the Instructions for Form 8582-CR.    \\xa0 Line 19 Enter the total amount of certain payroll taxes. Payroll taxes, for this purpose, mean only the following taxes.    Federal income taxes the tax-exempt employer was required to withhold from employees’ wages in calendar year 2019.   Medicare taxes the tax-exempt employer was required to withhold from employees’ wages in calendar year 2019.

       " '   Instructions for Form W-7 (09/2019)  Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (Use with the August 2019 revision of Form W-7)    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 09/2019        Instructions for Form W-7 - Introductory Material       Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form W-7 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/FormW7.   \\xa0 What’s New  ITINs for spouses and dependents who reside outside of the United States. Spouses and dependents residing outside of the United States shouldn’t apply for, or renew, an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) unless they qualify for an allowable tax benefit. Examples include a dependent parent who qualifies the primary taxpayer to claim the head of household filing status, or a dependent who files his or her own tax return. The individual must be listed on an attached U.S. federal tax return with the schedule or form that applies to the allowable tax benefit. For tax years 2018 through 2025, you can’t claim a personal exemption deduction for yourself, your spouse, or your dependents.   Expiration and renewal of ITINs. An ITIN that hasn’t been included on a U.S. federal tax return at least once in the last 3 consecutive tax years will expire. In addition, ITINs that were assigned before 2013 will expire according to an annual schedule based on the middle digits of the ITIN. The middle digits refer to the fourth and fifth positions of the ITIN. For example, the middle digits for 9xx-78-xxxx are \"78.\" Expired ITINs or ITINs that are about to expire must be renewed in order to avoid delays in processing your tax return. For more information, see When To Apply, later, or visit IRS.gov/ITIN.  \\xa0 ITINs not used in the last 3 consecutive tax years. If your ITIN wasn’t included on a U.S. federal tax return at least once for tax years 2016, 2017, or 2018, your ITIN will expire on December 31, 2019. You need to take action to renew it if it\\'ll be included on a U.S. federal tax return. See Do You Need To Renew Your ITIN, later, for more information.   \\xa0 ITINs with the middle digits \"83,\" \"84,\" \"85,\" \"86,\" and \"87\" will expire. If your ITIN’s middle digits (the fourth and fifth positions) are \"83,\" \"84,\" \"85,\" \"86,\" or \"87,\" your ITIN will remain in effect until December 31, 2019. You need to take action to renew it if it’ll be included on a U.S. federal tax return filed in 2020. See Do You Need To Renew Your ITIN, later, for more information.   \\xa0 ITINs with the middle digits \"70\" through \"82\" have expired. If your ITIN’s middle digits (the fourth and fifth positions) are \"70,\" \"71,\" \"72,\" \"73,\" \"74,\" \"75,\" \"76,\" \"77,\" \"78,\" \"79,\" \"80,\" \"81,\" or \"82,\" your ITIN is expired, unless you already submitted a renewal application and it was approved. If you haven’t already renewed, you need to take action now to renew it if it’ll be included on a U.S. federal tax return. See Do You Need To Renew Your ITIN, later, for more information.    Dependent applicants must now specify their relationship to the U.S. citizen/resident alien. An applicant who chooses reason d must now enter the relationship he or she has to the U.S. citizen/resident alien in the designated space on Form W-7.    \\xa0 Reminders  The passport isn’t a stand-alone document for certain dependents if no date of entry into the United States is present. A passport that doesn’t have a date of entry won’t be accepted as a stand-alone identification document for certain dependents. See Proof of U.S. residency for applicants who are dependents under Supporting Documentation Requirements, later, for more information.   Change of address. If you move before you get your ITIN, send a letter to the IRS using the address under Where To Apply, later.   Taxpayers residing outside of the United States can apply for an ITIN through a certifying acceptance agent. Taxpayers residing outside of the United States can apply for an ITIN using a certifying acceptance agent. See Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA) for more information.       General Instructions     \\xa0 Purpose of Form  Use Form W-7 for the following purposes.    To apply for an ITIN. An ITIN is a nine-digit number issued by the IRS to individuals who are required for federal tax purposes to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number but who don’t have and aren’t eligible to get a social security number (SSN).   To renew an ITIN. An ITIN only needs to be renewed if it’ll be included on a U.S. federal tax return and it’s expiring or has expired. See How To Apply, later, for more information on how to renew your ITIN.    \\xa0  \\xa0 If your ITIN is only used on information returns filed with the IRS by third parties, you don’t have to renew your ITIN even if the ITIN has expired for purposes of filing a U.S. federal tax return. However, in the future, if you file an income tax return, you will need to renew your ITIN at that time.  The ITIN is for federal tax purposes only. An ITIN doesn’t entitle you to social security benefits and doesn’t change your immigration status or your right to work in the United States.   The ITIN can’t be used to claim certain federal tax credits. Individuals filing tax returns using an ITIN aren’t eligible for the earned income credit (EIC). Also, a child who has an ITIN can’t be claimed as a qualifying child for purposes of the EIC. For more information, see Pub. 596, Earned Income Credit (EIC). Also, for tax years 2018 through 2025, a child who has an ITIN can’t be claimed as a qualifying child for purposes of the child tax credit and the additional child tax credit. For more information, see Pub. 972, Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents.

You don’t need to provide a return envelope. Applicants are permitted to include a prepaid Express Mail or courier envelope for faster return delivery of their documents and to ensure the secure delivery of valuable documents, such as passports. The IRS will then return the documents in the envelope provided by the applicant. If your original documents aren’t returned within 60 days, you can call the IRS (see Telephone help, earlier). If you will need your documents for any purpose within 60 days of submitting your ITIN application, you may wish to apply in person at an IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center or a CAA.

In these cases, applicants will be required to submit at least one of the original documents from the list earlier in addition to the passport to prove U.S. residency.  \\xa0 If you check box d for a dependent of a U.S. citizen or resident alien, then you may submit an original valid passport (or a certified copy from the issuing agency) without any other documents to prove your \"foreign status\" or \"identity\" only if the passport has a U.S. date of entry. Otherwise, you must submit one of the additional documents listed earlier with your passport to prove residency. If you don’t have one of the additional documents listed earlier to submit with your passport, you can’t use your passport as a stand-alone supporting document and must submit at least two types of documents listed in the \"Supporting Documentation\" table that prove residency, identity, and foreign status, and that meet the photograph requirement explained earlier.   \\xa0 Additional Documentation Requirements  \\xa0 Civil birth certificate. An original birth certificate is required if the applicant is under age 18 and hasn’t provided a valid passport. Civil birth certificates are considered current at all times because they don’t contain an expiration date.   \\xa0 Passports and national identification cards.

Leave the area of the SSN blank on the tax return for each person who is applying for an ITIN. After your Form W-7 has been processed, the IRS will assign an ITIN to the return and process the return.  \\xa0 There are exceptions to the requirement to include a U.S. federal tax return. If you claim one of these exceptions, you must submit the documentation required instead of a tax return. See Exceptions Tables, later.

If your ITIN won’t be included on a U.S. federal tax return, you don’t need to renew your ITIN at this time.  \\xa0 If you don’t renew the expired ITIN and you file a U.S. federal tax return with the expired ITIN, there may be a delay in processing your tax return.  Include the following in your renewal application package.     Your completed Form W-7.

See Supporting Documentation Requirements, earlier, for a list of the documents that can be submitted along with your renewal package. All family members listed on a tax return may renew their ITINs at the same time.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Spouses and dependents who reside outside of the United States and renew their ITIN to claim an allowable tax benefit must be listed on an attached U.S. federal tax return with the schedule or form that applies to the allowable benefit.  Certified copies. You can submit copies of original documents if you do any of the following.    Have the copies certified by the issuing agency.

When requesting an ITIN for a deceased taxpayer, the deceased must meet all of the requirements established to get an ITIN. Also, you must write \"Deceased\" across the top of Form W-7 and include the documentation shown in the following chart. \\xa0         IF you’re: THEN you must include:     The surviving spouse filing an original or amended joint return with your deceased spouse     Form W-7,   A U.S. individual income tax return, and   Documentation substantiating the identity and foreign status of the deceased.

If you’re filing an application for an extension of time to file using Form 4868, or making an estimated tax payment using Form 1040-ES or Form 1040-ES (NR), don’t file Form W-7 with those forms. Enter \"ITIN TO BE REQUESTED\" wherever your SSN or ITIN is requested. An ITIN will be issued only after you file a tax return and meet all other requirements.  \\xa0 If you attached your tax return to your Form W-7, leave the area of the SSN blank on the tax return for each person who is applying for an ITIN.   \\xa0 When To Apply  First-time ITIN applications.

If you’re unable to file your tax return by the due date, you must file an application for an extension of time to file. Failure to timely file the tax return with a complete Form W-7 and required documentation may result in the denial of refundable credits, such as the additional child tax credit (available for tax years prior to 2018) and the American opportunity tax credit, if you otherwise qualify. Don’t file your tax return without Form W-7. If you meet one of the exceptions described in Exceptions Tables at the end of these instructions, you may complete and submit Form W-7 at any time.   \\xa0 You can’t electronically file (e-file) a return using an ITIN in the calendar year the ITIN is assigned. If you need to file multiple-year returns, you can attach them all to your Form W-7 and submit them to the IRS. Once your ITIN is assigned, you can e-file returns in the following years. For example, if you apply for and receive an ITIN in 2020, you may not e-file any tax return using that ITIN (including prior-year returns) until 2021.  Renewal ITIN applications. If you’re renewing an existing ITIN, you may submit your Form W-7 renewal application (without filing a tax return) immediately.

TACs that don’t offer ITIN document authentication service will mail the original documents, Form W-7, and the tax return to the IRS Austin Service Center for processing.   Through an acceptance agent. You also can apply through one of the two types of acceptance agents authorized by the IRS.    Acceptance Agent (AA).   Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA).    \\xa0  \\xa0 Acceptance Agent (AA). An Acceptance Agent (AA) can help you complete and file Form W-7.

If you check this box, you must complete lines 6a, 6c, 6d, and 6g, and provide your passport with a valid U.S. visa. If you’re present in the United States on a work-related visa (F-1, J-1, or M-1), but won’t be employed (that is, your presence in the United States is study related), you can choose to attach a letter from the Designated School Official (DSO) or Responsible Officer (RO) instead of applying with the SSA for an SSN. The letter must clearly state that you won’t be securing employment while in the United States and your presence here is solely study related. This letter can be submitted instead of a Social Security Administration denial letter if you’re filing a tax return with this Form W-7 or claiming Exception 2 (explained later). Nonresident alien students and exchange visitors, their spouses, and dependents under the Student Exchange Visitors Program (SEVP) claiming Exception 2 (no tax return attached) can have their original ID certified by an SEVP-approved institution, rather than mailing originals to the IRS.

Frequently, third parties (such as banks and other financial institutions) that are subject to information-reporting and withholding requirements will request an ITIN from you to enable them to file information returns required by law. If you’re requesting an ITIN for this reason, you may be able to claim one of the exceptions described later. Enter on the dotted line next to box h the exception that applies to you. Identify the exception by its number, alpha subsection (if applicable), and category under which you’re applying (for example, enter \"Exception 1a-Partnership Income\" or \"Exception 3-Mortgage Interest\").

This entry should reflect your name as it’ll appear on a U.S. federal tax return.  \\xa0 Your ITIN will be established using this name. If you don’t use this name on the U.S. federal tax return, the processing of the U.S. federal tax return may be delayed.   Line 1b. Enter your name as it appears on your birth certificate if it’s different from your entry on line 1a.   Line 2. Enter your complete mailing address on line 2. This is the address the IRS will use to return your original documents and send written notification of your ITIN application status. The IRS won’t use the address you enter to update its records for other purposes unless you include a U.S. federal tax return with your Form W-7. If you aren’t including a U.S. federal tax return with your Form W-7 and you changed your home mailing address since you filed your last U.S. federal tax return, also file Form 8822, Change of Address, with the IRS at the address listed in the Form 8822 instructions.  Note. If the U.S. Postal Service won’t deliver mail to your physical location, enter the U.S. Postal Service’s post office box number for your mailing address. Contact your local U.S. Post Office for more information. Don’t use a post office box owned and operated by a private firm or company.  \\xa0   Line 3. Enter your complete foreign (non-U.S.) address in the country where you permanently or normally reside, even if it’s the same as the address on line 2. If you no longer have a permanent residence due to your relocation to the United States, enter only the foreign country where you last resided on line 3. If you’re claiming a benefit under an income tax treaty with the United States, the income tax treaty country must be the same as the country listed on line 3.  \\xa0 If you choose reason b, you must provide a complete foreign address on line 3.  \\xa0 Don’t use a post office box or an \"in care of\" (c/o) address instead of a street address on line 2 if you’re entering just a \"country\" name on line 3. If you do, your application may be rejected.   Line 4. Enter your date of birth in the month/day/year (MM/DD/YYYY) format, where MM = 1 to 12 and DD = 1 to 31. To be eligible for an ITIN, your birth country must be recognized as a foreign country by the U.S. Department of State.   Line 6a. Enter the country or countries (in the case of dual citizenship) in which you’re a citizen. Enter the complete country name; don’t abbreviate.   Line 6b. If your country of residence for tax purposes has issued you a tax identification number, enter that number on line 6b. For example, if you’re a resident of Canada, enter your Canadian social security number (known as the Canadian Social Insurance Number).   Line 6c. Enter only U.S. nonimmigrant visa information. Include the USCIS classification, number of the U.S. visa, and the expiration date in month/day/year format. For example, if you have an F-1/F-2 visa with the number 123456 that has an expiration date of December 31, 2021, enter \"F-1/F-2,\" \"123456,\" and \"12/31/2021\" in the entry space. Individuals in possession of an I-20/I-94 document(s) should attach a copy to their Form W-7.   Line 6d.

Enter the name of the state or country or other issuer, the identification number (if any) appearing on the document(s), the expiration date, and the date on which you entered the United States. Dates must be entered in the month/day/year format. \\xa0  Note. If you’re submitting a passport, or a certified copy of a passport from the issuing agency, no other documentation is required to prove your identity and foreign status. Ensure any visa information shown on the passport is entered on line 6c and the pages of the passport showing the U.S. visa (if a visa is required for your Form W-7) are included with your Form W-7. A passport that doesn’t have a date of entry will no longer be accepted as a stand-alone identification document for dependents, unless the dependents are from Canada, Mexico, or dependents of U.S. military personnel stationed overseas. If you’re submitting more than one document, enter only the information for the first document on this line. Attach a separate sheet showing the required information for the additional document(s). On the separate sheet, be sure to write your name and \"Form W-7\" at the top.  \\xa0  \\xa0 The \"Date of entry into the United States\" must contain the complete date on which you entered the country for the purpose for which you’re requesting an ITIN (if applicable). If you’ve never entered the United States, enter \"Never entered the United States\" on this line. A passport without an entry date doesn’t prove U.S. residency and may not be used as a stand-alone document for certain dependents. See Supporting Documentation Requirements, earlier.   \\xa0 Example. You entered the United States on August 1, 2019, to work for Company X. You want to file a return for the income you earned in the United States in 2019. You aren’t eligible to get a social security number. You file Form W-7 with your 2019 return. Enter \"08/01/2019\" on line 6d of Form W-7.   Line 6e. If you ever received an ITIN and/or an Internal Revenue Service Number (IRSN), check the \"Yes\" box and complete line 6f. If you never had an ITIN or an IRSN, or if you don’t know your ITIN or IRSN, check the No/Don’t know box. An IRSN is a nine-digit number issued by the IRS to persons who file a return or make a payment without providing a taxpayer identification number. You would’ve been issued this number if you filed a U.S. federal tax return and didn’t have an SSN. This IRSN will appear on any correspondence the IRS sent you concerning that return. If you’re submitting Form W-7 to renew your ITIN, you must include your previously assigned ITIN on line 6f to avoid delays in processing your Form W-7.   Line 6f. If you have both an ITIN and/or an IRSN, list them in the space(s) provided. Identify your first, middle, and last name under which the ITIN and/or IRSN was issued. If you were issued more than one IRSN, attach a separate sheet listing all the IRSNs you received. On the separate sheet, be sure to write your name and \"Form W-7\" at the top. If you’re submitting Form W-7 to renew your ITIN, the name under which you applied for your ITIN must be included on line 6f to avoid delays in processing your Form W-7.  Note. If you’re renewing your ITIN and your legal name has changed since the original assignment of your ITIN, you’ll need to submit documentation to support your legal name change, such as your marriage certificate or a court order, which may include a divorce decree. Attach supporting documentation to Form W-7.  \\xa0   Line 6g. If you checked reason f, you must enter the name of the educational institution and the city and state in which it’s located. You also must enter your length of stay in the United States. If you’re temporarily in the United States for business purposes, you must enter the name of the company with whom you’re conducting your business and the city and state in which it’s located. You also must enter your length of stay in the United States.    \\xa0 Signature  \\xa0 Who Can Sign Form W-7 Generally, the applicant is required to sign Form W-7.

The parent or court-appointed guardian must type or print his or her name in the space provided and check the appropriate box that indicates his or her relationship to the applicant. If the individual is signing as a court-appointed guardian, a copy of the court-appointment papers showing the legal guardianship must be attached.

The person signing, if other than the applicant, must type or print his or her name in the space provided, check the appropriate box that indicates his or her relationship to the applicant, and attach Form 2848.  \\xa0 A spouse can’t sign for his or her spouse, unless the Power of attorney box is checked and Form 2848 has been attached to Form W-7.   Applicant can’t sign their name. If an applicant can’t sign his or her name, then the applicant must sign his or her mark (for example, an \"X\" or a thumbprint) in the presence of a witness. The witness’s signature is also required and must be identified as that of a witness.  Note. All Powers of Attorney (POAs) submitted to the IRS must be in English.

       " '   Instructions for Form W-7A (10/2017)  Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 10/2017        Instructions for Form W-7A - Introductory Material     \\xa0    Future Developments    For the latest information about developments related to Form W-7A and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/FormW7A.      General Instructions    \\xa0 Purpose of Form Use Form W-7A to apply for an IRS adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN) for a child who is placed in your home for purposes of legal adoption. However, don\\'t use Form W-7A if you will be able to obtain a social security number (SSN) for the child in time to file your tax return. Also, don\\'t use Form W-7A if the child isn\\'t a U.S. citizen or resident alien. Use Form W-7 instead.   \\xa0 What Is an ATIN An ATIN is a temporary nine-digit number issued by the IRS to individuals who are in the process of legally adopting a U.S. citizen or resident alien child but who can’t get an SSN for that child in time to file their tax return. You may be able to use an ATIN on your tax return to take the following benefits based on the child.    Dependency exemption. See Pub. 501.   Credit for child and dependent care expenses. See Pub. 503.   Adoption Credit. See the Instructions for Form 8839.   Child tax credit. See Pub. 972.    \\xa0 However, you can’t use an ATIN to claim the earned income credit (EIC).  \\xa0 If you must identify a qualifying child by an ATIN to claim the child tax credit or additional child tax credit, you must get the ATIN before the due date of your return (including extensions); otherwise, you can’t claim these credits for the child needing an ATIN on either your original or an amended return for that year, even if you later get an ATIN.   \\xa0 How Long Can You Use an ATIN An ATIN issued to you for your adoptive child will expire 2 years from the date it is issued. You will receive a notice from the IRS 3 months before the expiration date to remind you that the ATIN will expire. The notice will explain how you can apply for an extension if the adoption will not be final by the expiration date. After the adoption is final, don’t continue using the ATIN. Instead, you must use an SSN. To apply for an SSN for the child, fill in Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, and return it, with the appropriate evidence documents, to the Social Security Administration (SSA). You can get Form SS-5 online at SSA.gov, from your local SSA office, or by calling the SSA at 1-800-772-1213. It usually takes about 2 weeks to get an SSN once the SSA has all the evidence and information it needs.  Application for SSN denied. If the SSA denies your application for an SSN, contact the IRS to request an extension or reactivation of the ATIN. When you request the extension or reactivation of the ATIN, include the SSA’s denial letter or an explanation with your correspondence.    \\xa0 Who Must File File Form W-7A if all of the following apply.    You have a child living with you who was placed in your home for legal adoption by an authorized placement agency.   You can’t obtain the child’s existing SSN even though you have made a reasonable attempt to obtain it from the birth parents, the placement agency, and other persons.   You can’t obtain an SSN for the child from the SSA because, for example, the adoption isn’t final.   You are eligible to claim the child as a dependent on your tax return.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Don’t file Form W-7A if the child isn’t a U.S. citizen or resident alien. Instead, apply for an ITIN using Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.   \\xa0 How To File Your must complete Form W-7A at least 4 to 8 weeks before you will need an ATIN. Sign and date the application and mail it to the address under Where To File. Be sure to include the required attachments (see What To Include With Form W-7A).   \\xa0 What To Include With Form W-7A You must attach signed and dated documentation to Form W-7A to prove the child was placed with you for legal adoption (not for foster care) by an authorized placement agency. In general, one of the following documents will satisfy this requirement.    A copy of the placement agreement entered into between you and an authorized placement agency.   A copy of the document signed by a hospital official authorizing the release of a newborn child from the hospital to you for legal adoption.   A copy of the court order or other court document ordering or approving the placement of a child with you for legal adoption.   An affidavit signed by the adoption attorney or government official who placed the child with you for legal adoption pursuant to state law.    \\xa0  Foreign adoptions. In addition, if you adopt a foreign child with U.S. citizenship or resident alien status, include with your Form W-7A a copy of your child’s:    Permanent resident card (green card),   Certificate of Citizenship, or   Passport with \"I-551\" stamp.    \\xa0 If the adoption of the foreign child is final, but you are unable to get an SSN for your child, see Application for SSN denied.    \\xa0 Where To File \\xa0 Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Stop 6182 Austin, TX 73301-0066 \\xa0   \\xa0 When To Expect the ATIN It usually takes 4–8 weeks to get an ATIN.

Ejemplos de esto es un padre dependiente que reúne los requisitos para que el contribuyente primario pueda reclamar el estado civil para efectos de la declaración de cabeza de familia; o si un dependiente presenta su propia declaración de impuestos. La persona tiene que ser anotada en la declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos y también se tiene que adjuntar el anexo o formulario correspondiente al beneficio tributario permisible que se está reclamando.

Todo ITIN que no se haya incluido en una declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos en al menos uno de los últimos 3 años tributarios consecutivos vencerá. Además, los ITIN que fueron asignados antes de 2013 vencerán según un itinerario anual basado en los dígitos del medio del ITIN. Los dígitos del medio del ITIN son el cuarto y quinto dígito de dicho número. Por ejemplo, los dígitos del medio del número 9xx-78-xxxx son \"78\". Los ITIN que estén vencidos o los que están próximos a vencerse se tienen que renovar para así evitar demoras en la tramitación de su declaración de impuestos.

Un solicitante que escoge la razón d ahora tiene que anotar en el espacio designado en el Formulario W-7(SP) la relación que él o ella tiene con el ciudadano/extranjero residente de los Estados Unidos.    \\xa0 Recordatorios  El pasaporte no es un documento autónomo para ciertos dependientes si éste no muestra una fecha de entrada a los Estados Unidos. Todo pasaporte que no tenga fecha de entrada a los Estados Unidos no se aceptará como documento único (autónomo) de identificación para ciertos dependientes. Vea Cómo los solicitantes que son dependientes comprueban la residencia estadounidense bajo Requisitos para los Documentos Comprobantes, más adelante, para más información.   Cambio de dirección.

Los contribuyentes que viven fuera de los Estados Unidos pueden solicitar un ITIN usando un agente tramitador certificador. Vea Agente tramitador certificador (CAA) para más información.       Instrucciones Generales     \\xa0 Propósito de este Formulario  Use el Formulario W-7(SP) para los propósitos siguientes:    Para solicitar un ITIN. Un ITIN es un número que consta de nueve dígitos y que es asignado por el IRS a personas físicas que tienen el requisito de tener un número de identificación del contribuyente estadounidense para propósitos de los impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos, pero dichas personas físicas no tienen y no cumplen los requisitos para obtener un número de seguro social (SSN, por sus siglas en inglés) de los Estados Unidos.   Para renovar un ITIN. Solo se tiene que renovar un ITIN si se va a incluir en una declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos y si éste va a vencer o ha vencido. Vea Cómo se Solicita, más adelante, para más información sobre cómo renovar su ITIN.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Si su ITIN solo se usa en declaraciones informativas que se presentan ante el IRS por terceros, usted no tiene que renovar su ITIN, aunque el ITIN haya vencido para propósitos de la presentación de la declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, si usted presentará una declaración de impuestos sobre los ingresos en un futuro, necesitará renovar su ITIN en ese momento.  El ITIN se usa exclusivamente para propósitos tributarios federales. Un ITIN no le da derecho a los beneficios de Seguro Social y no cambia su condición migratoria ni su derecho de trabajar en los Estados Unidos.   El ITIN no se puede usar para reclamar ciertos créditos tributarios federales. Las personas que presentan declaraciones de impuestos usando un ITIN no tienen el derecho de reclamar el crédito por ingreso del trabajo (EIC, por sus siglas en inglés). Además, un hijo que tiene un ITIN no puede ser reclamado como hijo calificado para propósitos del EIC. Para más información, vea la Publicación 596SP, Crédito por Ingreso del Trabajo (EIC). Además, para los años tributarios 2018 al 2025, un hijo que tiene un ITIN no puede ser reclamado como hijo calificado para propósitos del crédito tributario por hijos ni el crédito tributario adicional por hijos. Para más información, vea la Publicación 972, Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents (Crédito tributario por hijos y crédito por otros dependientes), en inglés. Sin embargo, usted sí podría reclamar el crédito por otros dependientes (ODC, por sus siglas en inglés) por su hijo y otros parientes calificados (excluyendo a su cónyuge) que viven en los Estados Unidos si ellos obtienen un ITIN para la fecha de vencimiento de su declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos (incluyendo prórrogas) y cumplen ciertos otros requisitos. Vea las instrucciones para su declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos para más información.   Números de Seguro Social. No complete el Formulario W-7(SP) si tiene un SSN o si cumple los requisitos para obtenerlo.

Para solicitar un SSN, vea el Formulario SS-5-SP, Solicitud para una tarjeta de Seguro Social, en español. Para obtener el Formulario SS-5-SP, o para saber si cumple los requisitos para obtener un SSN, visite el sitio SSA.gov/espanol, o comuníquese con una oficina de la Administración del Seguro Social (SSA, por sus siglas en inglés). Si tiene una solicitud pendiente para un SSN, no presente el Formulario W-7(SP). Complete el Formulario W-7(SP) únicamente si la SSA le notifica que usted no cumple los requisitos para obtener un SSN. Si la SSA determina que usted no reúne los requisitos para obtener un SSN, tiene que obtener una carta de denegación y adjuntarla al Formulario W-7(SP). Esto corresponde si adjunta o no el Formulario W-7(SP) a su declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos. No obstante, los estudiantes, profesores e investigadores deben consultar la información para el recuadro f, más adelante.    \\xa0 Quién Reúne los Requisitos para Completar este Formulario Las siguientes personas físicas reúnen los requisitos para completar el Formulario W-7(SP):    Toda persona física que no cumpla los requisitos para obtener un SSN, pero que tenga que proporcionar un número de identificación del contribuyente para propósitos de los impuestos estadounidenses o para presentar una declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos, tiene que solicitar un ITIN completando el Formulario W-7(SP).

Si usted solicita un ITIN bajo esta categoría, asegúrese de adjuntar una copia de su visa al Formulario W-7(SP) e incluir la fecha de llegada a los Estados Unidos en la línea 6d.  \\xa0 Sólo se pueden reclamar exenciones personales por cónyuges y dependientes en los años tributarios anteriores a 2018.   h.

Éste debe ser igual al nombre que usa en su declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos.  \\xa0 Se establecerá su ITIN con este nombre.

Anote su nombre tal como aparece en su acta de nacimiento si es distinto al que aparece en la línea 1a.   Línea 2. Anote su dirección postal completa en la línea 2. Ésta es la dirección a la cual el IRS le devolverá sus documentos originales y le enviará la notificación escrita sobre el estado de su solicitud de ITIN. El IRS no usará la dirección que usted anote en esta línea para actualizar sus archivos para ningún otro propósito, a menos que usted incluya una declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos junto con su Formulario W-7(SP). Si usted no incluye una declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos junto con su Formulario W-7(SP) y cambió su dirección postal residencial desde que presentó su última declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos, presente también el Formulario 8822, Change of Address (Cambio de dirección), en inglés, ante el IRS a la dirección indicada en las instrucciones del Formulario 8822, también disponibles en inglés.   Nota: Si el Servicio Postal de los Estados Unidos no entrega correo a su domicilio, anote el número del apartado postal del Servicio Postal de los Estados Unidos como su dirección postal. Comuníquese con su oficina local del Servicio Postal de los Estados Unidos para más información. No utilice un apartado postal que sea propiedad de una empresa o negocio privado y operado por el mismo.  \\xa0   Línea 3. Anote la dirección completa de su domicilio en el país extranjero (fuera de los Estados Unidos) donde reside permanente o normalmente, aunque sea la misma dirección que se anotó en la línea 2. Si ya no tiene domicilio permanente debido a que se mudó a los Estados Unidos, escriba en la línea 3 únicamente el país extranjero en donde vivió antes de mudarse a los Estados Unidos. Si solicita beneficios conforme a un tratado tributario que aplica al impuesto estadounidense sobre los ingresos, la línea 3 tiene que indicar el país que está suscrito a dicho tratado.  \\xa0 Si usted escoge la razón b, tiene que proveer una dirección en el extranjero completa en la línea 3.  \\xa0 Si ha incluido solo el nombre del \"país\" en la línea 3, no anote en la línea 2 una dirección con un apartado postal ni una dirección en donde reciba correspondencia \"a cargo de\" un tercero (c/o, por sus siglas en inglés) en lugar de su dirección residencial. Si lo hace, su solicitud podría ser denegada.   Línea 4. Anote su fecha de nacimiento en formato de mes/día/año (MM/DD/AAAA), donde MM = 1 a 12 y DD = 1 a 31.

Por ejemplo, si es residente de Canadá, anote su número de seguro social canadiense (conocido como el Número de Seguridad Social canadiense).   Línea 6c. Anote únicamente información relacionada con su visa de extranjero no inmigrante de los Estados Unidos.

Por ejemplo, si tiene una visa con la clasificación F-1/F-2 y el número 123456 que tiene una fecha de vencimiento del 31 de diciembre de 2021, anote \"F-1/F-2\", \"123456\" y \"12/31/2021\" en los espacios correspondientes. Las personas que posean uno o más Formularios I-20/I-94 deberán adjuntar una copia de dicho(s) documento(s) al Formulario W-7(SP).   Línea 6d.

Tiene que escribir las fechas en el formato siguiente: mes/día/año.  Nota: Si usted está presentando un pasaporte o una copia certificada de un pasaporte por la agencia emisora, no se requiere ninguna otra documentación para comprobar su identidad y condición de extranjero. Asegúrese que cualquier información en la visa que aparezca en el pasaporte se anote en la línea 6c y que las páginas del pasaporte que muestran la visa estadounidense (si se le requiere una visa para el Formulario W-7(SP)) se incluyan con su Formulario W-7(SP). Todo pasaporte que no tenga fecha de entrada a los Estados Unidos ya no se aceptará como documento único (autónomo) de identificación para un dependiente, a menos que el dependiente sea de Canadá o México, o que sea un dependiente de un miembro de las Fuerzas Armadas de los Estados Unidos que está destacado en el extranjero. Si usted está enviando más de un documento, escriba únicamente la información para el primer documento en esta línea. Adjunte una hoja separada para mostrar la información necesaria para el (los) documento(s) adicional(es).

Si nunca ha entrado a los Estados Unidos, anote \"Never entered the United States \" (Nunca entré a los Estados Unidos) en esta línea. Un pasaporte que no tenga fecha de entrada a los Estados Unidos no comprueba residencia estadounidense y no se puede usar como documento único (autónomo) de identificación para ciertos dependientes. Vea Requisitos para los Documentos Comprobantes, anteriormente.   Ejemplo. Usted entró a los Estados Unidos el 1 de agosto de 2019 para trabajar para la Empresa X. Usted desea presentar una declaración de impuestos sobre los ingresos del trabajo que obtuvo en los Estados Unidos en 2019. Usted no reúne los requisitos para obtener un número de Seguro Social. Usted presenta el Formulario W-7(SP) con su declaración del año 2019. Escriba \"08/01/2019\" (mes/día/año) en la línea 6d del Formulario W-7(SP).   Línea 6e. Si alguna vez recibió un ITIN y/o un número de identificación del Servicio de Impuestos Internos (IRSN, por sus siglas en inglés), marque el recuadro Sí y anote el (los) número(s) correspondiente(s) en la línea 6f. Si nunca ha recibido un ITIN o un IRSN o si no sabe su ITIN o IRSN, marque el recuadro No/No sé. El IRSN es un número de nueve dígitos emitido por el IRS a personas que presentan una declaración de impuestos o hacen un pago de impuestos sin facilitar un número de identificación del contribuyente. A usted se le habría emitido este número si hubiera presentado una declaración de impuestos federales de los Estados Unidos y no contara con un SSN. Ese IRSN aparece en toda correspondencia que el IRS le haya enviado relacionada con esa declaración. Si presenta el Formulario W-7(SP) para renovar su ITIN, usted tiene que incluir su ITIN que fue asignado previamente en la línea 6f para evitar demoras en la tramitación de su Formulario W-7(SP).   Línea 6f. Si tiene un ITIN y/o un IRSN, anótelo(s) en el (los) espacio(s) provisto(s). Identifique su primer y segundo nombre y apellido bajo el cual el (los) ITIN y/o IRSN fue (fueron) provisto(s). Si se le ha emitido más de un IRSN, adjunte al Formulario W-7(SP) una hoja por separado en donde haya anotado todos los IRSN que haya recibido. Asegúrese de escribir su nombre y \" Form W-7(SP) \" (Formulario W-7(SP)) en la parte superior de la hoja separada. Si presenta el Formulario W-7(SP) para renovar su ITIN, tiene que incluir en la línea 6f el nombre bajo el cual usted solicitó su ITIN para evitar demoras en la tramitación de su Formulario W-7(SP).  Nota: Si usted está renovando su ITIN y su nombre legal ha cambiado luego de que se le asignó su ITIN original, usted necesitará presentar documentos que comprueben el cambio legal de su nombre, tal como la licencia (o certificado) de matrimonio u orden judicial, la cual podría incluir un decreto de divorcio. Adjunte los documentos comprobantes al Formulario W-7(SP).  \\xa0   Línea 6g. Si usted marcó la razón f, tiene que anotar el nombre de la institución educativa y la ciudad y estado donde se ubica. Tiene que anotar además la duración de su estancia en los Estados Unidos. Si se encuentra temporalmente en los Estados Unidos para propósitos comerciales, tiene que escribir el nombre de la empresa con la cual realiza actividades comerciales y la ciudad y estado donde se ubica. También tiene que anotar la duración de su estancia en los Estados Unidos.    \\xa0 Firma  \\xa0 Quién Puede Firmar el Formulario W-7(SP) Por lo general, al solicitante se le requiere firmar el Formulario W-7(SP). Las siguientes son unas excepciones a este requisito.  El solicitante es un dependiente que tiene menos de 18 años de edad. Si el solicitante es un dependiente y tiene menos de 18 años de edad, uno de sus padres o su tutor legal puede firmar el formulario si el hijo no puede firmarlo. El padre, la madre o el tutor legal tiene que escribir a máquina o con letra de molde su nombre propio en el espacio provisto y marcar el recuadro correspondiente para indicar su parentesco con el solicitante.

El solicitante es un dependiente que tiene 18 años de edad o más. Si el solicitante es un dependiente y tiene 18 años de edad o más, él mismo puede firmar el Formulario W-7(SP) o nombrar a uno de sus padres, un tutor legal u otra persona para firmarlo. La persona que lo firma, si no es el solicitante, tiene que escribir a máquina o con letra de molde su propio nombre en el espacio provisto, marcar el recuadro correspondiente para indicar su parentesco con el solicitante y adjuntar el Formulario 2848(SP) (o el Formulario 2848, en inglés).  \\xa0 Un cónyuge no puede firmar por su esposo o esposa, a menos que haya marcado el recuadro Poder legal y haya adjuntado el Formulario 2848(SP) (o el Formulario 2848, en inglés) al Formulario W-7(SP).   El solicitante no puede firmar su propio nombre. Si el solicitante no puede firmar su propio nombre, entonces él o ella tiene que firmar con una marca; por ejemplo, una \"X\" o la huella del pulgar en presencia de un testigo. También se requiere que el testigo firme y que se indique que dicha firma es del testigo.   Nota: Todo poder legal (POA, por sus siglas en inglés) presentado ante el IRS tiene que estar en inglés. Si se recibe un poder legal en un idioma extranjero, éste no se considerará válido, a menos que esté acompañado por una traducción al inglés que esté certificada. En la sección del poder legal denominada Acciones autorizadas (Acts authorized, en el formulario en inglés), tiene que constar claramente el propósito del mismo.

       " '   Instructions for the Requester of Forms W–8BEN, W–8BEN–E, W–8ECI, W–8EXP, and W–8IMY (04/2018)   Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 04/2018        Instructions for the Requester of Forms W–8BEN, W–8BEN–E, W–8ECI, W–8EXP, and W–8IMY - Introductory Material    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted. Future developments.  For the latest information about developments related to the Forms W-8 and their instructions for requesters, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/UAC/About-Form-W8.     What\\'s New   On January 6, 2017, the Treasury Department and the IRS finalized certain regulations under chapter 3 (TD 9808) and chapter 4 (TD 9809) and published temporary regulations under chapters 3 and 4 to supplement certain provisions of those final regulations. Among other things, the final and temporary regulations under chapters 3 and 4 modified certain requirements with respect to the collection of Forms W-8, the contents of the forms, their validity periods, and the due diligence requirements of withholding agents. Forms W-8 (and their instructions) were updated in June and July 2017, generally to reflect the amendments to the regulations under chapters 3 and 4. On January 24, 2017, the Treasury Department and the IRS finalized certain regulations under sections 871(m) and 1441 (TD 9815) and published temporary regulations under section 871(m) to supplement certain provisions of those final regulations. Among other things, the final and temporary regulations under sections 871(m) and 1441 modified the rules for withholding and reporting certain payments made to qualified derivative dealers (QDDs). The Treasury Department and the IRS also issued Notice 2017-42, 2017-34 I.R.B. 212, which announced certain intended amendments to the regulations, such as delaying until 2019 withholding under chapters 3 and 4 on dividends paid to a QDD in its equity derivatives dealer capacity. The transition rules related to the Qualified Securities Lender (QSL) regime described in Notice 2010-46, 2010-24 I.R.B. 757, have been extended to include payments made in calendar years 2018 and 2019. See Notice 2018-05, 2018-6 I.R.B. 341. Therefore, withholding agents may accept and rely on a valid Form W-8IMY on which an entity represents its chapter 3 status as a QSL until December 31, 2019. In addition, on September 25, 2017, the Treasury Department and the IRS released Notice 2017-46, 2017-41 I.R.B. 275, providing revised guidance for certain withholding agents to obtain and report taxpayer identification numbers and dates of birth of their account holders and on March 5, 2018, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued supplemental guideline in Notice 2018-20, 2018-12 I.R.B. 444. See Foreign TINs and Notes for Validating Form W-8BEN-E, later, for the revised requirements for certain withholding agents to obtain on Form W-8 an account holder’s foreign TIN and, for an individual, date of birth.  \\xa0 Purpose of Instructions These instructions supplement the instructions for the forms listed below and provide notes to assist withholding agents and foreign financial institutions (FFIs) in validating the forms for chapters 3 and 4 purposes. These instructions also outline the due diligence requirements applicable to withholding agents for establishing a beneficial owner’s foreign status and claim for reduced withholding under an income tax treaty. These instructions are not inclusive of all requirements that may apply to a withholding agent for validating Forms W-8. A withholding agent should also reference the applicable regulations under chapters 3 and 4 and the instructions for each Form W-8 listed below.    Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals).   Form W-BEN-E, Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities).   Form W-8ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States.   Form W-8EXP, Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting.   Form W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting.    \\xa0 For definitions of terms not defined in these instructions, see the Forms W-8 and their accompanying instructions.  \\xa0 Throughout these instructions, a reference to or mention of \"Form W-8\" includes Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY. These instructions reflect the regulatory changes described earlier that are relevant to Forms W-8 and certain other changes reflected on the most current revisions to the Form W-8 series published as of the date of publication of these instructions. Thus, different rules may apply to withholding agents with respect to prior revisions of Forms W-8 for which these regulatory changes did not yet apply, and different requirements may apply to future revisions of these forms. See Requesting Prior Versions of Form W-8, later, including the limitations on such use.      \\xa0    \\xa0 Who Is a Withholding Agent?  Any person, U.S. or foreign, in whatever capacity acting, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of an amount subject to withholding for chapter 3 purposes or a withholdable payment for chapter 4 purposes is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, or U.S. branch of certain foreign banks and insurance companies. If several persons qualify as withholding agents for a single payment, the tax required to be withheld must only be withheld once. Generally, the person who pays (or causes to be paid) an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3 or a withholdable payment to the foreign person (or to its agent) must withhold. See the Instructions for Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons, and Form 1042-S, Foreign Person\\'s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding, for return filing and information reporting obligations with respect to payments made to foreign persons. For effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) allocable to a foreign partner, the partnership is generally the withholding agent and must file Form 8804, Annual Return for Partnership Withholding Tax (Section 1446); Form 8805, Foreign Partner\\'s Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax; and Form 8813, Partnership Withholding Tax Payment Voucher (Section 1446).   \\xa0 Responsibilities of a Withholding Agent To Obtain Form W-8   \\xa0 Chapter 3 Responsibilities (Other Than Section 1446) Generally, an amount is subject to withholding for purposes of chapter 3 if it is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (and original issue discount (OID)), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums) or items of income excluded from gross income without regard to the U.S. or foreign status of the owner of the income, such as interest under section 103(a). Amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding do not include amounts that are not FDAP as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short term OID). For purposes of sections 1441 and 1442, if you are a withholding agent, you must withhold 30% of any payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding made to a payee that is a foreign person unless you can reliably associate the payment with documentation (for example, Form W-8 or Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) upon which you can rely to treat the payment as made to (a) a payee that is a U.S. person or (b) a beneficial owner that is a foreign person entitled to a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding. In certain circumstances, however, you may be allowed to associate a payment with documentary evidence rather than a Form W-8 for a payment made outside the United States with respect to an offshore obligation under Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1). A withholding agent must also withhold under section 1443 on certain payments to foreign tax-exempt organizations that are unrelated business taxable income or subject to the 4% excise tax imposed by section 4948. However, a withholding agent making a payment to a foreign person need not withhold under chapter 3 if the foreign person assumes responsibility for withholding on the payment as a qualified intermediary (QI) (other than a QI that is acting as a QDD for payments with respect to underlying securities that are subject to withholding), or if the foreign person is a withholding foreign partnership (WP), or a withholding foreign trust (WT) that has provided a valid Form W-8IMY certifying to such status. For 2017 and 2018, however, a withholding agent is not required to withhold on dividends paid to a QI acting as a QDD. Withholding under chapter 3 is also not required if the payment is made to a U.S. branch of a foreign insurance company or foreign bank or a territory financial institution that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person under the requirements of Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) and provides a valid Form W-8IMY certifying to such status.   \\xa0 Chapter 4 Responsibilities For purposes of chapter 4, if you are a withholding agent, you must withhold 30% of any payment that is a withholdable payment (as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)) made to a nonparticipating FFI that is not an exempt beneficial owner or to a non-financial foreign entity (NFFE) that is not an excepted NFFE and does not disclose its substantial U.S. owners (or certify that it has no substantial U.S. owners). In addition, if you are a withholding agent and also a participating FFI, you must withhold to the extent required under Regulations section 1.1471-4(b) and the FFI agreement, which, in addition to the requirements described in the previous sentence, require withholding on withholdable payments made to recalcitrant account holders. You must determine if a payment is a withholdable payment without regard to any exceptions from withholding applicable under chapter 3. For each such withholdable payment, you must obtain a Form W-8 (or other documentation permitted under Regulations section 1.1471-3(d)) upon which you are permitted to rely under chapter 4 to determine the chapter 4 status of a payee that is a foreign person for purposes of whether withholding applies under chapter 4. Thus, a determination of whether a Form W-8 is valid for purposes of providing an exemption from chapter 4 withholding is a separate determination from whether the Form W-8 may be relied upon to provide an exemption from (or reduction in) withholding under chapter 3. For purposes of determining whether withholding under chapter 4 applies to a payment to a QI, WP, or WT, the exceptions in chapter 3 for QIs, WPs, and WTs will apply, provided the entity includes its chapter 4 status on Form W-8IMY. See also Notes for Validating Form W-8IMY under Form W-8IMY, later, for the requirements for withholdable payments made to certain U.S. branches that act as intermediaries.   \\xa0 Section 1446 Responsibilities Generally, under section 1446, a partnership that allocates ECTI to a foreign partner must withhold at the highest tax rate applicable to that person for the type of income allocated (for example, ordinary income or capital gains) in accordance with the provisions of Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6. Unless the partnership is a publicly traded partnership, the partnership must withhold in the year the ECTI is allocable to the foreign partner, rather than the year in which the distribution is made. The partnership may rely on documentation (for example, Form W-8 or Form W-9) to determine if the partner is foreign or domestic and the type of partner (for example, individual or corporate) and whether the partner qualifies for certain tax preferential rates (for example, capital gains and collectibles). The documentation must contain a U.S. TIN for the partner. Generally, a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership that submits a Form W-8 for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will satisfy the documentation requirements under section 1446. However, a partnership that knows or has reason to know that the documentation provided is incorrect or unreliable must presume the partner is foreign. Additionally, a partnership may rely on other means to determine the non-foreign status of a partner, but will only be protected from liability (including penalties) if such determination is correct. A partnership is in no event required to rely on other means to determine the non-foreign status of a partner and may demand that the partner provide an acceptable certificate (for example, a Form W-8BEN).   \\xa0 Other Uses of Form W-8 \\xa0  Chapter 61 and section 3406. The Form W-8 you collect may also be used to establish a person\\'s status for purposes of domestic information reporting under chapter 61 and backup withholding under section 3406, including for a payment settlement entity to determine whether a participating payee is a foreign person for purposes of section 6050W. In general, if you receive a Form W-8 that you can reliably associate with the payment, you are exempt from reporting the payment on a Form 1099 and withholding under section 3406.    FFI documenting account holders. If you are an FFI maintaining a financial account, you may be required to perform due diligence procedures to identify and document the account holder under the chapter 4 regulations or an applicable intergovernmental agreement (IGA) even if you are not making a payment to the account holder that is subject to withholding. You may use Form W-8 to document the chapter 4 status of an account holder and to validate a claim of foreign status made by the account holder, such as when the account has certain U.S. indicia. For example, a participating FFI may treat an individual account holder claiming foreign status that has U.S. indicia (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(B)) as a foreign person for purposes of the FFI’s U.S. account reporting requirements (that is, Form 8966) when the individual provides a Form W-8BEN and certain documentary evidence establishing foreign status.  If you are an FFI documenting an account holder of an account that you determine is excepted as a financial account under Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2), a Form W-8 (or other permitted documentation for chapter 4 purposes) is not required unless the form is associated with amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3. In such a case, a valid chapter 4 status (including that the account is not a financial account) is not required to be provided on the form.    \\xa0 Requesting Form W-8  Generally, if you are making a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment, you must withhold as required at the 30% rate under chapter 3 or 4 unless you can reliably associate the payment with a Form W-8 or other permitted documentation to permit withholding at a reduced rate or an exemption from withholding. You can reliably associate a payment with a Form W-8 if you hold a valid form that contains the information required for purposes of chapter 3 or 4 (as applicable), you can reliably determine how much of the payment relates to the form, and you may rely upon the form under the due diligence requirements. See Due Diligence Requirements in General, later. You should request a Form W-8 from any person to whom you are making a payment that you believe to be a foreign person. You should request the form before making a payment so that you have the form when you make the payment. See, however, Regulations sections 1.1441-1(b)(7)(ii) and 1.1471-3(c)(7)(ii) for when you may be able to rely on a Form W-8 obtained after the date of a payment to support reduced withholding for chapter 3 or 4 purposes. A withholding agent or payor that fails to obtain a valid Form W-8 or Form W-9 and fails to withhold as required under the presumption rules may be assessed tax at the 30% rate under chapter 3 or 4 or the 28% backup withholding rate under section 3406, as well as interest and penalties for lack of compliance. If you are a partnership allocating income that is effectively connected with the conduct of the partnership’s U.S. trade or business and you fail to withhold as required under section 1446, you will be liable for the tax required to be withheld. In addition, you may be liable for interest, penalties, and additions to the tax even if there is no underlying tax liability due from a foreign partner on its allocable share of the partnership’s ECTI. If you are a withholding agent making a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment and you make the payment to an intermediary, you must obtain documentation from such intermediary (including the intermediary’s chapter 4 status if the payment is a withholdable payment), as well as any required documentation for the beneficial owner(s) of the payment to the extent required under the chapter 3 or 4 regulations. Do not send Forms W-8 to the IRS. Instead, keep the forms in your records for as long as they may be relevant to the determination of your liability under section 1461 (for amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding), section 1474 (for withholdable payments), or Regulations section 1.1471-4(c)(2)(iv) (for an FFI documenting account holders).  Form W-8 provided or signed electronically. You may rely on a valid Form W-8 received by facsimile or scanned and furnished to you by email unless you know that the person transmitting the Form W-8 is not authorized to do so. You may also rely on an otherwise valid Form W-8 received electronically from a third-party repository if the form was uploaded or provided to the third-party repository and there are processes in place to ensure that the withholding certificate can be reliably associated with a specific request from you and a specific authorization from the person providing the form (or an agent of the person providing the form) for you to receive the withholding certificate. You may also rely on a withholding statement received from a third-party repository if the intermediary provides a Form W-8IMY and withholding statement through the repository, provides an updated withholding statement to you in the event of any change in the information previously provided, and ensures there are processes in place to update you when there is a new withholding statement (and Forms W-8, as necessary) in the event of any change that would affect the validity of the prior forms or withholding statement. For purposes of this paragraph, a third party repository is an entity that maintains withholding certificates but is not an agent of the applicable withholding agent or the person providing the certificate. See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv)(E) for the complete requirements for relying on a withholding certificate from a third-party repository. If you are a withholding agent that maintains a system for furnishing Forms W-8 electronically, you must satisfy the requirements of Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv)(B). You may otherwise accept a Form W-8 with an electronic signature if the Form W-8 reasonably demonstrates that the form has been electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and statement that the form has been electronically signed). You may not treat a Form W-8 with a typed name in the signature line as validly signed without further information supporting that the signature is an electronic signature.   \\xa0    Requesting Prior Versions of Form W-8    If the IRS issues an updated version of a Form W-8, you may accept the prior version of the form until the later of six full months after the revision date shown on the form or the end of the calendar year the updated form is issued (based on the revision date shown on the form), unless the IRS has issued guidance that affects the period for acceptance of the prior version (for example, if a new payee status is required under revised regulations that is not in the prior version and is relevant to the payee’s claim). You were allowed to accept a Form W-8BEN with a revision date of February 2014 until December 31, 2017.     \\xa0 Due Diligence Requirements in General When you receive a completed Form W-8, you must review it for completeness and accuracy with respect to the claims made on the form, as well as any information attached to the form, such as withholding statements and beneficial owner withholding certificates associated with a Form W-8IMY. In general, you may rely on the information and certifications provided on the form unless you have actual knowledge or reason to know that the information is unreliable or incorrect. If you know or have reason to know that any information is unreliable or incorrect, you must obtain a new Form W-8 or other appropriate documentation. You may accept a valid Form W-8 for chapter 3 or 61 purposes (or for backup withholding purposes) that does not contain a valid chapter 4 status with respect to payments that are not withholdable payments.  Reason to know. In general, you have reason to know that a Form W-8 is unreliable or incorrect if:     The form is incomplete with respect to any item that is relevant to the claims made;   The form contains any information that is inconsistent with the claims made;    The form lacks information necessary to establish that the beneficial owner is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding; or    You have other account information that is inconsistent with the claims made, or you have knowledge of relevant facts or statements contained in the withholding certificate or other documentation that would cause a reasonably prudent person in your position to question the claims made. For example, if you have information in your records that contradicts information provided on the form, you may not rely on the form.      With respect to a claim for benefits under an income tax treaty, your reason to know requirement that the treaty claim is unreliable or incorrect includes when the beneficial owner claims benefits under a treaty that does not exist or is not in force. For this purpose, you may use the list maintained at IRS.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z to check whether a treaty exists and is in force.  If you are a financial institution (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)), insurance company, or broker or dealer in securities maintaining an account for a direct account holder that is the beneficial owner of the payment, and you make a payment of U.S. source FDAP income to the direct account holder, you have reason to know that a Form W-8 that is a beneficial owner withholding certificate (excluding Form W-8ECI) is unreliable or incorrect for establishing foreign status (or residency in a treaty country in item 4, directly below) only if one or more of the following circumstances exist. See also Regulations section 1.441-7(b)(3)(ii) for special rules that apply to preexisting obligations (as defined for such purpose).    You have classified the account holder claiming foreign status as a U.S. person in your account information, the Form W-8 has a current permanent residence address or a current mailing address in the United States, you have a current residence or current mailing address in the United States as part of the account information, the direct account holder notifies you of a new residence or mailing address in the United States, or, only to the extent described in Regulations section 1.1441-7(b)(5), you have a U.S. telephone number as the sole telephone number for the account holder. However:     An individual who has provided a Form W-8BEN may be treated as a foreign person if:    You have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence establishing foreign status (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) that does not contain a U.S. address, and the individual provides you with a reasonable explanation, in writing, supporting his or her claim of foreign status;   For a payment made outside the U.S. with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)), you have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence establishing foreign status (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) that does not contain a U.S. address;   For a payment made with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)), you classify the individual as a resident of the country where the obligation is maintained, you are required to report payments made to the individual annually on a tax information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the country in which the obligation is maintained, and that country has an income tax treaty or information exchange agreement in effect with the United States; or   For a case in which you have classified the account holder as a U.S. person in your account information, you have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B)) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States.      You may treat an entity that has provided you with a Form W-8BEN-E as a foreign person if you do not know or have reason to know that the entity is a flow-through entity and:    You have in your possession or obtain documentation establishing foreign status that substantiates that the entity is actually organized or created under the laws of a foreign country; or   For a payment made with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)), you classify the entity as a resident of the country in which the account is maintained, you are required to report a payment made to the entity annually on a tax information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the country in which the obligation is maintained, and that country has an income tax treaty or tax information exchange agreement in effect with the United States.         The form is provided with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)) and the direct account holder has provided standing instructions directing you to pay amounts from its account to an address in, or an account maintained in, the United States, unless the account holder provides either a reasonable explanation in writing that supports its foreign status or documentary evidence establishing its foreign status (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)).   The Form W-8BEN is provided by an individual that is a direct account holder and is used to establish foreign status and you have, either on accompanying documentation or as part of your account information, an unambiguous indication of a place of birth for the individual in the United States, unless you have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence (described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B)) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States and either:     A copy of the individual’s Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States, or   A reasonable written explanation of the account holder’s renunciation of U.S. citizenship or the reason the account holder did not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth.      The Form W-8 is provided by a direct account holder and is used to establish residence in a treaty country and:    The permanent residence address on the form is not in the treaty country or the direct account holder notifies you of a new permanent residence address that is not in the treaty country, unless the direct account holder provides a reasonable explanation for the permanent residence address outside the treaty country or you have in your possession, or obtain, documentary evidence (described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) that establishes residency in the treaty country.    The permanent residence address is in the treaty country, but the mailing address on the form is not in the treaty country or you have a current mailing address that is not in the treaty country as part of your account information for the direct account holder, unless:    You have in your possession, or obtain, documentary evidence (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) supporting the claim of residence in the treaty country and the additional documentation does not contain an address outside the treaty country;   You have in your possession, or obtain, documentation that establishes that the direct account holder is an entity organized in a treaty country (or an entity managed and controlled in a treaty country, if required by the applicable treaty);   You know that the address outside the treaty country (other than a P.O. box or in-care-of address) is a branch of the direct account holder that is a resident of the treaty country; or   The direct account holder provides a written statement that reasonably establishes entitlement to treaty benefits.      The direct account holder has standing instructions for you to pay amounts from the account to an address or account outside the treaty country unless the account holder provides a reasonable explanation, in writing, establishing the account holder\\'s residence in the applicable treaty country or you have in your possession or obtain documentary evidence (described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) establishing the account holder’s residence in the applicable treaty country.       \\xa0 Where required, a reasonable explanation supporting an individual’s claim of foreign status means a written statement prepared by the individual, or, in the alternative, a checklist provided by you and completed by the individual stating that the individual meets one of the requirements listed in Regulations section 1.1441-7(b)(12)(i) through (iv).    Hold mail instruction. An address that is provided subject to an instruction to hold all mail to that address is not a permanent residence address, such that you may not rely upon the Form W-8. However, the address can be used as a permanent residence address if the person has provided you with the documentary evidence that is permitted under Regulations section 1.1441-1(c)(38)(ii). If, after a Form W-8 is provided, a person’s permanent residence address is subsequently subject to a hold mail instruction, this is a change in circumstances requiring the person to provide the documentary evidence described in the preceding sentence in order to use the address as a permanent residence address.  For additional information on the standards of knowledge for chapter 3 purposes for relying on a claim of foreign status or a claim of residency in a treaty country, see Regulations section 1.1441-7(b). For additional information on the standards of knowledge for Forms W-8 provided for chapter 4 purposes, see Regulations section 1.1471-3(e).   Dual claims under a tax treaty. If you are making payments to a foreign entity that is simultaneously claiming a reduced rate of tax under a tax treaty on its own behalf and a separate treaty claim on behalf of its interest holders for different payments or for different portions of the same payment, you may accept the dual claims even though you hold different withholding certificates that require you to treat the entity inconsistently. Alternatively, you may choose to apply only the claim made by the entity, provided that the entity may be treated as the beneficial owner of the income. If, however, inconsistent claims are made for the same portion of a payment, you may either reject both claims and request consistent claims for that portion of the payment, or you may choose which reduction in rate to apply.    \\xa0 Requirements for Obtaining and Verifying a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN) If you receive a Form W-8BEN-E, W-8IMY, or W-8EXP from an entity payee claiming certain chapter 4 statuses, you must obtain and verify the entity’s GIIN against the published IRS FFI list. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(e)(3). You must obtain and verify the GIIN for the following chapter 4 statuses.    Participating FFIs (including reporting Model 2 FFIs),   Registered deemed-compliant FFIs (including reporting Model 1 FFIs),   Direct reporting NFFEs,   Sponsored direct reporting NFFEs, and   Certain nonreporting IGA FFIs (as described below).    \\xa0 If you receive a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY from a nonreporting IGA FFI that is a trustee-documented trust that indicates its trustee is foreign, you must obtain a GIIN of the trustee on the form. If you receive a Form W-8 from a nonreporting IGA FFI that checks Model 2 IGA in Part XII of Form W-8BEN-E, Part XIX of Form W-8IMY, or Part III, line 15 of Form W-8EXP (as applicable), and identifies a category of entity that is a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Annex II of an applicable Model 2 IGA, you must obtain and verify the GIIN of the nonreporting IGA FFI against the published IRS FFI list. Additionally, if you receive a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY from a nonreporting IGA FFI that provides a citation to a section of the Regulations for its registered deemed-compliant status in Part XII of Form W-8BEN-E or Part XIX of Form W-8IMY (as applicable) or the FFI identifies itself as a registered deemed-complaint FFI in Part I, line 4, of Form W-8EXP, you must obtain and verify the GIIN of the nonreporting IGA FFI against the published IRS FFI list. See Regulations sections 1.1471-1(b)(83) for the definition of nonreporting IGA FFI and 1.1471-3(d)(7)(i) for the documentation requirements for nonreporting IGA FFIs. For an entity claiming status as a certified deemed-compliant FFI that is a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(2)(iii) on a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY, you must obtain the GIIN for the sponsoring entity and verify it against the published IRS FFI list. For an entity claiming status as a sponsored investment entity or controlled foreign corporation described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(F), you must obtain and verify the GIIN of the sponsored investment entity or controlled foreign corporation against the published IRS FFI list, not the GIIN of the sponsoring entity. If you receive a Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8IMY, or Form W-8EXP from an entity payee that is claiming chapter 4 status as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI and a sponsored FFI described in the Treasury regulations under section 1471), direct reporting NFFE, sponsored direct reporting NFFE, or nonreporting IGA FFI required to provide a GIIN (as described earlier) that contains \"Applied for\" in the box for the GIIN, the payee must provide its GIIN within 90 days of providing the form. A Form W-8 from such a payee that does not include a GIIN, or includes a GIIN that does not appear on the published IRS FFI list, will be invalid for purposes of chapter 4 beginning on the date that is 90 days after the date the form is provided. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(e)(3)(iii) and (iv). You may only accept a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY with Part II completed if the entity shown in Part II is an FFI that is a branch of the entity identified in Part II, line 1, and the branch is receiving a withholdable payment, or if the entity shown in Part II is a disregarded entity that is identified in Part I, line 3, as receiving the payment. If you receive a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY from a branch (other than a U.S. branch) or disregarded entity described in the preceding sentence that is receiving a payment associated with the form, you must verify the GIIN of the branch (unless the branch is treated as a nonparticipating FFI) or disregarded entity that is provided in Part II against the published IRS FFI list and not that of the entity identified in Part I, line 1. In such a case, you may accept the form without a GIIN on line 9a (for Form W-8BEN-E) or line 9 (for Form W-8IMY). If you receive a Form W-8BEN-E from a U.S. branch, the branch may provide the GIIN of any other branch of the FFI (including the GIIN for the FFI’s residence country). A U.S. branch providing a Form W-8IMY is not required to provide a GIIN.   \\xa0 Presumption Rules If you do not receive a valid Form W-8 or Form W-9 that you may rely upon under the due diligence requirements, or cannot otherwise determine whether a payment should be treated as made to a U.S. or foreign person, you must apply the presumption rules provided in the Regulations under sections 1441, 1446, 1471, 6045, and 6049. If the presumption rules are applied to treat a person as a foreign person, the 30% withholding rate applies and cannot be reduced (for example, no treaty rate). You may not rely on the presumption rules if you have actual knowledge that a higher withholding rate is applicable. If you determine that you are making a withholdable payment to an entity and cannot reliably associate the payment with a Form W-8 or other permitted documentation that is valid for chapter 4 purposes, you are required to treat the entity payee as a nonparticipating FFI.   \\xa0 When To Request a New Form W-8 Request a new Form W-8:    Before the expiration of the validity period of an existing Form W-8 (when applicable);   If the existing form does not support a claim of reduced rate or is incomplete with respect to any claim made on the form (such as may result, for example, from a new regulatory requirement relevant to the Form W-8); or   If you know or have reason to know of a change in circumstances that makes any information on the current form unreliable or incorrect for purposes of chapter 3 or 4 (to the extent applicable) based on the claims made on the form.    \\xa0  \\xa0 Example. A foreign individual investor opens an account with a broker to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds and provides Form W-8BEN to obtain the portfolio interest exemption. The investor does not complete Part II of Form W-8BEN because he or she is not claiming treaty benefits. Later, the investor purchases U.S. stock and claims treaty benefits on dividend income. The withholding agent must obtain a new Form W-8BEN at that time that provides the information required in Part II to be able to withhold based on the treaty claim and not at the 30% withholding tax rate.   Changes in circumstances for chapter 4 purposes. For chapter 4 purposes, a change in circumstances generally occurs when there is a change in a person’s chapter 4 status. You must treat a Form W-8 as invalid when you know or have reason to know of a change in circumstances that affects the correctness of the form. However, you may continue to treat an FFI as having the same chapter 4 status that it had prior to the change in circumstances until the earlier of 90 days from the date of the change or the date that new documentation is obtained. You are not considered to have reason to know of a change in circumstances if an FFI’s chapter 4 status changes solely because the jurisdiction where the FFI is resident, organized, or located is treated as having an IGA in effect or if the jurisdiction had a Model 2 IGA in effect and is later treated as having a Model 1 IGA in effect. If such change in circumstances occurs, the FFI may provide you with oral or written confirmation (including by email) of its new chapter 4 status rather than providing a new Form W-8, and you must retain a record of this confirmation.  If an FFI is resident, organized, or located in a jurisdiction that is treated as having an IGA in effect, and the jurisdiction’s status on the Treasury Department’s IGA list (located at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/pages/FATCA.aspx) is later updated to indicate that it is no longer treated as having an IGA in effect, you will have reason to know of a change in circumstances with respect to the FFI’s chapter 4 status on the date that the jurisdiction ceases to be treated as having an IGA in effect. See Announcement 2016–27, 2016-33 I.R.B. 238. If such change in circumstances occurs, the FFI may provide you with oral or written confirmation (including by email) of its new chapter 4 status rather than providing a new Form W-8, and you must retain a record of this confirmation.    \\xa0    Period of Validity    Generally, a Form W-8 is valid from the date signed until the last day of the third succeeding calendar year unless a change in circumstances occurs that makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8BEN signed on September 30, 2018, generally remains valid through December 31, 2021. However, under certain conditions a Form W-8 will be valid indefinitely unless there has been a change in circumstances. For example, a Form W-8BEN and documentary evidence supporting an individual’s claim of foreign status (other than the portion of the form making a claim for treaty benefits) are indefinitely valid if the form and documentary evidence are provided within 30 days of each other. A Form W-8BEN-E and documentary evidence supporting an entity’s claim of foreign status (other than the portion of the form making a claim for treaty benefits) that are received by a withholding agent before the validity period of either the form or the documentary evidence would otherwise expire are indefinitely valid. A Form W-8IMY is valid indefinitely as described in this paragraph, but see Notes for Validating Form W-8IMY, later, for the validity period for a Form W-8IMY provided by a QDD. For further information on the period of validity for a Form W-8 for chapter 3 purposes, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), and for chapter 4 purposes, see Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii).   \\xa0    Forms Received That Are Not Dated or That Contain Inconsequential Errors or Omissions    If a Form W-8 is valid except that the person providing the form has not dated the form, you may date the form from the day you receive it and measure the validity period from that date. Generally, you may treat a withholding certificate as valid if it contains an error or omission that is inconsequential and you have sufficient documentation on file to supplement the missing information. However, a failure to establish an entity type or make a required certification is not inconsequential. For example, if an entity receiving a withholdable payment selects a certified deemed-compliant FFI status on line 5 of Form W-8BEN-E but does not complete the corresponding required certifications in Part V, the form is invalid for chapter 4 purposes. On the other hand, if you receive a Form W-8 for which the person signing the form does not also print a name before the signature when required on the form, you are not required to treat the form as incomplete if you have documentation or information supporting the identity of the person signing the form. An abbreviation of a country of residence on Form W-8BEN is an inconsequential error if it is an ambiguous abbreviation. For further information about withholding certificates that contain inconsequential errors, see Regulations sections 1.1441-1(b)(7)(iv) for chapter 3 purposes and 1.1471-3(c)(7)(i) for chapter 4 purposes.    \\xa0 Foreign TINs If you are a U.S. office or branch of a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or specified insurance company (each as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)) documenting an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) of an account that is a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) you must obtain the account holder’s TIN for its jurisdiction of tax residence (foreign TIN) on a Form W-8 that is a beneficial owner withholding certificate in order for the form to be valid for a payment of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement), unless:    The account holder is resident of a jurisdiction that is not listed in section 3 of Revenue Procedure 2017-46, 2017-43 I.R.B. 372, which may be further updated in future published guidance;   The account holder is resident in a jurisdiction that has been identified by the IRS on a list of jurisdictions for which witholding agents are not required to obtain foreign TINs;   The account holder is a government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, or resident of a U.S. territory; or   You obtain a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN.    \\xa0 A reasonable explanation that an account holder does not have a foreign TIN must address why the account holder was not issued a foreign TIN only to the extent provided in the instructions for the applicable Form W-8. If an account holder provides an explanation other than the one described in the instructions for the applicable Form W-8, you must determine whether the explanation is reasonable. You may accept an explanation that is written in the line on the form for a foreign TIN, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If the account holder writes the explanation on the line for foreign TINs or in the margins of the form, the account holder may shorten it to \"not legally required\". See Notice 2017-46 for transitional rules for withholding agents to obtain foreign TINs for accounts documented with otherwise valid Forms W-8 that were signed before January 1, 2018. See also Notice 2017-46 for the standards of knowledge (including when there is a change in circumstances) with respect to the foreign TIN requirement. See Notice 2018-20 for additional information on the IRS list of jurisdictions for which withholding agents are not required to obtain foreign TINs.   \\xa0 Alternative Certifications Under an Applicable IGA If you are an FFI subject to a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA using Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY to document account holders pursuant to the due diligence requirements of Annex I of an applicable IGA, you may request alternative certifications from your account holders in accordance with the requirements of, and definitions applicable to, the IGA instead of the certifications on Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY. You should provide those certifications to account holders from whom you request a Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY, and the account holder should attach the completed certification to the Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY in lieu of completing a certification otherwise required. In such a case, you must provide a written statement to the account holder stating that you have provided the alternative certification to meet your due diligence requirements under an applicable IGA and you must associate the certification with the Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY. If you are a withholding agent (including an FFI), you may also request and rely upon an alternative certification from an entity account holder to establish that the account holder is a NFFE (rather than a financial institution) under an applicable IGA. An entity providing such a certification will still be required, however, to provide its chapter 4 status (that is, the type of NFFE) in Part I, line 5, as determined under the regulations if you are a withholding agent other than an FFI documenting an account holder under Annex 1 of an applicable IGA. For example, if you are a U.S. withholding agent that receives a Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY from an entity account holder certifying to its status as a passive NFFE, you may request a written certification that the entity is not a financial institution as defined under the IGA applicable to the entity and document it under the regulations by obtaining the NFFE\\'s certification of its chapter 4 status in Part I, line 5. In the case of an FFI documenting an account holder under Annex 1 of an applicable IGA however, a nonprofit organization treated as an active NFFE under the Annex may provide an FFI with an alternative certification that it is an NFFE that qualifies as a nonprofit organization under an applicable IGA. In such a case, the nonprofit organization will not be required to check a box in Part I, line 5, and the FFI may treat the entity as an excepted NFFE. If you receive an alternative certification under an applicable IGA described in the preceding paragraphs, you may rely on such certification unless you know or have reason to know the certification is incorrect.    \\xa0 Rules for Specific Types of Forms W–8  \\xa0 Form W–8BEN You should request Form W-8BEN from any foreign individual for the purposes described previously in these instructions (that is, if you are making a payment subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment; if you are a partnership documenting a partner for purposes of section 1446; if a payee claims foreign status for purposes of domestic information reporting and backup withholding; or if you are an FFI using this form to document an account for purposes of chapter 4).  \\xa0    Notes for Validating Form W-8BEN    \\xa0  Line 6 (Foreign TIN). If you do not obtain a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN) on line 6 (or on a separate statement) when required (see Foreign TINs, earlier), you must treat the form as invalid for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement).    Line 8 (Date of birth). If you are a U.S. office or branch of a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or specified insurance company (each as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)) documenting an individual account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) of an account that is a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)), you must obtain the individual account holder’s date of birth on the Form W-8BEN in order for the form to not be invalid for a payment of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement). If the individual’s date of birth is not provided on the Form W-8BEN, the form is not invalid if you otherwise have the date of birth in your account files for the account holder or you obtain the date of birth on a written statement (including a written statement transmitted by email) from the account holder and associate the written statement with the Form W-8BEN. See Notice 2017-46 for transitional rules for withholding agents to obtain dates of birth for accounts documented with otherwise valid Forms W-8 that were signed before January 1, 2018.    Line 10 (Special rates and conditions). If the beneficial owner is required to explain the additional conditions in the treaty that it meets to be eligible for the rate of withholding on line 10, you may accept a brief explanation for this purpose. You may accept a treaty claim without this explanation under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty or other income article, unless such article requires additional representations.      \\xa0 Form W–8BEN–E You should request Form W-8BEN-E from any foreign entity for the purposes described previously in these instructions for Form W-8BEN or if the payee is to establish that certain income from notional principal contracts is not effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (for reporting on Form 1042-S). See Regulations section 1.1441-4.  \\xa0    Notes for Validating Form W-8BEN-E     Part I, Line 4 (Chapter 3 status). If you receive a Form W-8BEN-E from an entity that indicates in Part I, line 4, that it is a disregarded entity, partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust, and the entity has checked \"No\" in Part I, line 4 (regarding the entity’s claim of treaty benefits), you should not accept the Form W-8BEN-E if the form is used with respect to reportable amounts or withholdable payments. In such a case, you should request the entity complete a Form W-8IMY if the entity is a partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust, or have the owner of a disregarded entity complete the appropriate Form W-8. If you are an FFI documenting an entity account holder solely for chapter 4 purposes (that is, you are not required to document the payee for purposes of withholding or domestic information reporting), the entity does not need to provide a chapter 3 status on line 4 of the form.   Part I, Line 9b (Foreign TIN). If you do not obtain a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN) on line 9b (or on a separate statement) when required (see Foreign TINs, earlier), you must treat the form as invalid for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement).    Part II (Disregarded Entity or Branch Receiving Payment). If you are making payments to multiple branches/disregarded entities that would be completing Part II, and the Part I information for each branch/disregarded entity is the same, instead of obtaining separate Forms W-8BEN-E with respect to each branch/disregarded entity, you may accept a single Form W-8BEN-E with a separate schedule attached that includes all of the information required by Part II for each branch/disregarded entity and you are able to allocate each payment to each branch/disregarded entity associated with the form. See Requirements for Obtaining and Verifying a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN), earlier, for when a GIIN is required when Part II is completed.   Part III (Claim of Tax Treaty Benefits), Line 14(b). For a Form W-8BEN-E obtained on or after January 1, 2017, an entity claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty that contains a limitation on benefits article must identify the limitation on benefits provision that it satisfies by checking one of the boxes in line 14(b). In general, the entity is only required to check one box, even if it satisfies more than one provision. If the applicable treaty has no limitation on benefits article, the entity must check the box for \"Other\" and enter “N/A” in the line provided. You may rely on the entity’s claim in line 14(b) unless you have actual knowledge that the claim is incorrect.    Part III, Line 15 (Special rates and conditions). If the beneficial owner is required to explain the additional conditions in the treaty that it meets to be eligible for the rate of withholding on line 15, you may accept a brief explanation. You may accept a treaty claim without this explanation under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty or other income article, unless such article requires additional representations.    Part IX, Line 24 (Owner-documented FFI). You may accept this certificate and treat an entity as an owner-documented FFI only if you are a designated withholding agent under the chapter 4 regulations. Also, an owner-documented FFI that is a nonreporting IGA FFI must check \"owner-documented FFI\" (and not \"nonreporting IGA FFI\") in line 5 and complete Part X. You may accept a Form W-8BEN-E from an entity claiming status as an owner-documented FFI that does not check box 24d in Part X regardless of whether you know that the entity is a trust that has one or more contingent beneficiaries.      \\xa0 Form W–8ECI You should request Form W-8ECI from any foreign person or organization to which you are making a payment if it is the beneficial owner of the income (or an entity engaged in a U.S. trade or business submitting the form on behalf of its owners, partners, or beneficiaries) and claims that the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. However, if you are a partnership, you should request a Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) from a foreign partner that is allocated income that is effectively connected with the conduct of the partnership\\'s trade or business in the United States. Nevertheless, a foreign partner that has made an election under section 871(d) or section 882(d) must provide that election to the partnership along with a Form W-8ECI. If you receive a Form W-8ECI without a U.S. TIN entered on line 7, you may not treat the income as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and you must apply the appropriate presumption rules. If you receive a Form W-8ECI without a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN) on line 8 (or on a separate statement) when required (see Foreign TINs, earlier), you must treat the form as invalid for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement). Your receipt of Form W-8ECI serves as a representation by the payee or beneficial owner that the items of income identified on line 11 are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Therefore, if a beneficial owner provides you with a Form W-8ECI, you may treat all of the U.S. source income identified on line 11 paid to that beneficial owner as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and not as a withholdable payment for purposes of chapter 4. Accordingly, a chapter 4 status is not required for a payee who provides a valid Form W-8ECI unless you are an FFI requesting a Form W-8ECI from an account holder for purposes of your chapter 4 due diligence requirements. If you pay items of income that are not identified on line 11 by the beneficial owner as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, generally you are required to obtain another type of Form W-8 from the beneficial owner. Generally, you may not treat an amount as income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States unless the beneficial owner gives you a valid Form W-8ECI. However, there are exceptions (described below) for income paid on notional principal contracts and payments made to certain U.S. branches.  Notional principal contracts reportable on Form 1042-S. Withholding at a 30% rate is not required on amounts paid under the terms of a notional principal contract whether or not a Form W-8ECI is provided (except when a payment made under such contract is U.S. source income, such as a dividend equivalent amount under section 871(m)). However, if the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, it is reportable by you on Form 1042-S (regardless of whether the payment is U.S. source income). You must treat income as effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, even if a Form W-8ECI has not been received, if the income is paid to a qualified business unit of a foreign person located in the United States or if the income is paid to a qualified business unit of a foreign person located outside the United States and you know, or have reason to know, that the payment is income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. However, a payment is not treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business if the payee provides a Form W-8BEN-E representing that the payment is not income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or makes a representation in a master agreement that governs the transactions in notional principal contracts between the parties (for example, an International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement), or in the confirmation on the particular notional principal contract transaction, that the payee is a U.S. person or a non-U.S. branch of a foreign person.    Payments to certain U.S. branches treated as effectively connected income. If you make a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or insurance company that does not provide a withholding certificate but has provided an EIN, the payment is presumed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States even if the foreign person (or its U.S. branch) does not give you a Form W-8ECI. If you do not obtain a Form W-8ECI or the U.S. branch’s EIN, the income paid cannot be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.    \\xa0 Form W–8EXP You should request Form W-8EXP from any foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession to which you are making a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding if such person is claiming an exemption from withholding under sections 1441, 1442, and 1443 pursuant to section 115(2), 501(c), 892, or 895, or claiming a rate of withholding under section 1443(b). Except as provided below, you should request Form W-8EXP from a person claiming an exemption from withholding under chapter 4 as an exempt beneficial owner or tax-exempt organization under section 501(c) or that is claiming any other chapter 4 status shown on the form when also claiming a chapter 3 status described in the preceding sentence. In certain cases, a GIIN may be required based on the chapter 4 status claimed on the form. See the Requirements for Obtaining and Verifying a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIINs), earlier. If you are an FFI documenting an account holder that is a tax-exempt organization or exempt beneficial owner (each as defined for chapter 4 purposes) to which you do not pay amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3, you may require that the account holder complete Form W-8BEN-E (rather than Form W-8EXP) to establish its status for chapter 4 purposes. A Form W-8EXP submitted by a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership for purposes of withholding under sections 1441 through 1443 will also establish that partner\\'s foreign status for purposes of section 1446. However, except as provided in Regulations section 1.1446-3(c)(3) (regarding certain tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)), the submission of Form W-8EXP will have no effect on whether the partner is subject to withholding under section 1446. You may treat a payee as an international organization without requiring a Form W-8EXP if the payee is designated as an international organization by an executive order (pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 288 through 288(f)) and other facts surrounding the payment reasonably indicate that the beneficial owner of the payment is an international organization. With regard to amounts derived from bankers\\' acceptances for chapter 3 purposes, you may treat a payee as a foreign central bank of issue without requiring a Form W-8EXP if the name of the payee and other facts surrounding the payment reasonably indicate that the beneficial owner of the payment is a foreign central bank of issue. A U.S. TIN is required if the beneficial owner is claiming an exemption or reduced rate of withholding based solely on a claim of tax-exempt status under section 501(c) or private foundation status. However, a U.S. TIN is not required from a foreign private foundation that is subject to the 4% excise tax on gross investment income (under section 4948(a)) that would be exempt from withholding except for section 4948(a) (for example, portfolio interest). If you receive a Form W-8EXP without a foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a foreign TIN) on line 8b (or on a separate statement) when required (see Foreign TINs, earlier), you must treat the form as invalid for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (as determined before the application of this requirement).   \\xa0 Form W–8IMY You should request Form W-8IMY from any entity that is a QI (including a QI acting as a QDD), nonqualified intermediary (including certain U.S. branches and territory financial institutions), a withholding foreign partnership (WP), a withholding foreign trust (WT), or a flow-through entity to which you make a withholdable payment or pay a reportable amount. A flow-through entity includes a foreign partnership (other than a WP), a foreign simple or grantor trust (other than a WT), and, for any payments for which a treaty benefit is claimed, any entity to the extent it is treated as fiscally transparent under the laws of the treaty jurisdiction, as provided in section 894 and the regulations thereunder (without regard to whether it is fiscally transparent under the laws of the United States). Before January 1, 2020, Form W-8IMY may also be provided by an entity to claim chapter 3 status as a qualified securities lender (QSL) with respect to payments of U.S. source substitute dividends and may be relied upon regardless of whether the QSL acts as an intermediary with respect to substitute dividends associated with the form. You may accept a Form W-8IMY from an individual acting as an agent or intermediary (as appropriately amended to account for individual status), but you are not required to obtain such form if you are able to associate payments you make to the person(s) for whom the individual acts. You may accept multiple Forms W-8IMY from an intermediary that is acting in multiple capacities (for example, as a QI for one account but a nonqualified intermediary or QDD for another account). However, a QI may provide you with a single Form W-8IMY that covers more than one category of QI shown on the form provided that it properly identifies to you the accounts and/or transactions on a withholding statement. You may accept a single Form W-8IMY for multiple branches of the entity providing the form if the information in Part I is the same for each branch and a separate schedule is attached that includes all of the Part II information on each branch and sufficient information to associate the payments with each branch. The chapter 4 status of an intermediary or flow-through entity is required on Part I of the form if the form is associated with a withholdable payment. Part II must be completed when a withholdable payment is made to a branch or disregarded entity described in Part II of the form. Generally, for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Regulations under sections 1441 or 1471, a Form W-8IMY must be associated with a withholding statement and withholding certificates (or documentary evidence, where permitted) for the beneficial owners. Generally, the withholding statement must allocate the payment to each payee (or pool of payees, where permitted, as described later), provide the rate of withholding for each payee (or pool of payees), and provide certain identification information on each payee that is not included in a pool. See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(3) for the allowance for a withholding agent to accept an alternative withholding statement from a nonqualified intermediary (which also applies to a flow-through entity). If you are a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, you may also request Form W-8IMY from an intermediary or flow-through entity that is an account holder to establish its chapter 4 status or status under an applicable IGA even when no payments subject to withholding or domestic information reporting are made to the account. In such a case, a withholding statement is not required.  \\xa0    Notes for Validating Form W-8IMY      QIs, WPs, and WTs (in general). A QI, WP, or WT acting in its capacity as such must provide the EIN that was issued to the entity in such capacity (that is, its QI-EIN, WP-EIN, or WT-EIN) on Form W-8IMY and not any other EIN it may have in its nonqualified intermediary, nonwithholding foreign partnership, or nonwithholding foreign trust capacity. Because status as a QI, WP, or WT for a financial institution is limited to certain classes of FFIs, if you are making a withholdable payment to a QI, WP, or WT that is a financial institution, you must verify that the QI, WP, or WT certifies its status as one of the permitted classes in Regulations sections 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii) (for a QI), 1.1441-5(c)(2)(ii) (for a WP), or 1.1441-5(e)(5)(v) (for a WT) and provides its GIIN (except in the case of certain foreign central banks of issue and retirement funds).  If a QI checks line 15b of Part III of the form to certify that it assumes primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility, you may accept the form even if you do not know if there are any U.S. accounts receiving reportable payments at the time of the certification. If a QI does not check line 15b or 15c of Part III of the form, you must confirm that the QI is not receiving payments for U.S. accounts that are reportable on Form 1099, and the QI must provide an updated Form W-8IMY or must provide a withholding statement if it allocates payments to such accounts for which it does not assume primary withholding responsibility. A QI may check line 15e of Part III of the form to indicate that it allocates a portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees that includes account holders of another intermediary or flow-through entity even if the withholding statement does not show any intermediaries or flow-through entities at the time the certification is provided. However, a QI is not required to check line 15e of Part III of the form until it provides a withholding statement identifying an intermediary or flow-through entity that receives a payment allocated to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees.    \\xa0 QIs acting as QDDs. You should only accept a Form W-8IMY from a QI acting as a QDD to the extent you are making payments with respect to potential section 871(m) transactions or underlying securities to the QDD when the entity claims QDD status in Part III of the form. A QDD must indicate its entity classification on line 16b of the form. If you are making such payment that is an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding to a QI that is acting as a QDD and the QDD is claiming treaty benefits applicable to the status identified on line 16b on the payment, you may treat the Form W-8IMY as a beneficial owner withholding certificate and provide such benefits if the QDD provides a statement associated to the Form W-8IMY that includes the necessary information with respect to the treaty claim required in Part III of Form W-8BEN-E. In such case, the portion of the certificate making a claim for treaty benefits is valid until the end of the third calendar year following the year in which the Form W-8IMY is signed (unless a change in circumstances occurs sooner), and the validation rules for a treaty claim apply. A QDD may instead provide a separate Form W-8BEN-E to make the treaty claim. You may otherwise treat a Form W-8IMY provided by a QDD (other than a flow-through entity or disregarded entity) as a beneficial owner withholding certificate for establishing foreign status of the QDD for a payment of U.S. source FDAP income (as long as the QDD provides its foreign TIN (when required) on a QDD withholding statement or a separate statement). A QDD that is receiving payments that it beneficially owns that are not covered by its QI agreement should provide the appropriate Form W-8 based on its status (and not Form W-8IMY). The QDD must provide to you a withholding statement to identify the home office or branch that is treated as the owner for U.S. income tax purposes and, in certain circumstances (described in the instructions for Form W-8IMY), the QDD’s foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why it has not been issued a foreign TIN, if required). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, you are not required to obtain a QDD withholding statement if the branch or home office of the QDD is identified on the form and the form is provided only for payments beneficially owned by the QDD (and a foreign TIN is provided when required). See Foreign TINs, earlier, for when you must treat the form as invalid if a foreign TIN or reasonable explanation is not provided.   \\xa0 QIs assuming withholding on payments of substitute interest. If a QI represents its status as a QI on a Form W-8IMY with respect to payments of interest and substitute interest and checks line 15g of Part III of the form, you may treat the QI as assuming withholding for payments of interest and substitute interest it receives from you in connection with a sale-repurchase or similar agreement, a securities lending transaction, or collateral that the QI holds in connection with its activities as a dealer in securities.   QSLs. If you make payment of a U.S. source substitute dividend to a QSL (prior to January 1, 2020), the QSL is required to provide its U.S. TIN. If you make a payment to a QSL (prior to January 1, 2020) that is a withholdable payment, you must collect a Form W-8IMY that includes the QSL’s chapter 4 status and GIIN (as applicable) to avoid withholding under chapter 4. A QSL that is a QI should check line 15f of Part III of the form and a QSL that is a nonqualified intermediary should check line 17d of Part IV of the form. You may not associate a Form W-8IMY from a QSL with a payment of a substitute dividend on or after January 1, 2020, and you should obtain a revised withholding certificate. For information on transition rules for 2018 and 2019 for withholding agents to apply with respect to QSLs, see Notice 2018-05.   U.S. branches. If you make a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or insurance company that represents that it is acting as an intermediary and has agreed to be treated as a U.S. person, you are not required to obtain the GIIN or chapter 4 status of the entity, but you must obtain the U.S. branch’s EIN. If you make a withholdable payment after June 30, 2017, to a U.S. branch of an FFI that is acting as an intermediary and that does not agree to be treated as a U.S. person, the branch must provide its EIN (but does not need to provide a GIIN or chapter 4 status) and certify that the branch is applying the rules described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) by checking the box on line 19c in Part VI of the form. If you do not obtain the certification from a U.S. branch described in the preceding sentence, you must treat the branch as a nonparticipating FFI and withhold under chapter 4 on withholdable payments made to the branch. You are not required to treat as invalid a Form W-8IMY from an account holder that completes Part VI of the form (to the extent required) but does not complete Part II of the form.    Territory financial institutions acting as intermediaries. If you make a payment to a territory financial institution acting as an intermediary, you must obtain the territory financial institution’s EIN if it agrees to be treated as a U.S. person for chapters 3 and 4. You are not required to obtain a GIIN from a territory financial institution.    Participating FFIs and registered deemed-compliant FFIs that are flow-through entities or acting as intermediaries. If a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an intermediary or flow-through entity provides you with a withholding statement and documentation for its account holders or payees, you are not required to verify the information on the account holders or payees provided in the documentation for chapter 4 purposes unless the information in the documentation is facially incorrect, and you are not required to obtain additional documentation for an account holder or payee in addition to the withholding certificate unless you are obtaining the documentation for purposes of chapter 3 or 61, or unless you know that the documentation review conducted by the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI was not adequate for purposes of chapter 4. See Regulations section 1.1441-7(b)(10) for the due diligence requirements for indirect account holders for purposes of chapter 3 and see Regulations section 1.1471-3(e)(4)(vi)(B) for standards that apply in such case to determine whether chapter 4 withholding applies. You may rely on documentation that does not include a chapter 4 status for an account holder of an intermediary or flow-through entity that is an FFI when the withholding statement provided by such entity indicates that the payment is made to an account excluded as a financial account under Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2). An intermediary or flow-through entity that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI may provide a status for chapter 4 purposes found under the requirements of (and documentation or information that is publicly available that determines the chapter 4 status of the payee permitted under) an applicable IGA for an account holder, and you may rely upon such status and documentation, provided that you have the information necessary to report on Form 1042-S. Additionally, see Alternative Certifications Under an Applicable IGA, earlier, for further details on alternative certifications. In general, if you make a withholdable payment to an intermediary or flow-through entity that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, the FFI may provide an FFI withholding statement that allocates a portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool. If an intermediary provides with its Form W-8IMY an FFI withholding statement that allocates a portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees, the FFI must provide a chapter 4 status on line 5. If the intermediary described in the preceding sentence is a nonqualified intermediary, it must provide the certification required in Part IV with respect to its compliance with the requirements of Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4) (or similar requirements under chapter 61 for a payment other than interest). If the intermediary is a QI, it must certify that it meets the requirements of Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) and, to the extent the U.S. payees are account holders of an intermediary or flow-through entity receiving a payment from the QI, the QI has obtained or will obtain documentation sufficient to establish each such intermediary or flow-through entity status as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or FFI that is a QI. An allocation of a payment shown on a withholding statement and made on or after April 1, 2017, to a nonqualified intermediary, nonwithholding foreign partnership, or nonwithholding foreign trust of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees must identify the payees consistent with the description in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2)(iii) (describing account holders of an FFI that is a non-U.S. payor that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 or 4 or under section 3406, and that are holders of U.S. accounts reported by the FFI under its FATCA requirements as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI).   Section 1446 requirements. You should request Form W-8IMY for purposes of section 1446 only from a foreign upper-tier partnership or foreign grantor trust. Generally, for purposes of section 1446, the Form W-8IMY submitted by these entities is used to transmit the forms of the owners of these entities. The other forms should be accompanied with the information necessary to reliably associate your effectively connected partnership items with the upper-tier partners, in the case of a foreign upper-tier partnership, and the grantor or other owner, in the case of a foreign grantor trust. Then you must look through these entities to the beneficial owners when determining your section 1446 tax obligation. A domestic upper-tier partnership may also provide you this information. Under those circumstances you may, but are not required to, pay the section 1446 withholding tax of the foreign partners of the domestic upper-tier partnership. See Regulations section 1.1446-5.      \\xa0 Requirements for Hybrid and Reverse Hybrid Entities A hybrid entity is an entity that is treated as fiscally transparent under the Code but is not treated as fiscally transparent under the tax laws of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. If you are making a payment to a foreign hybrid entity that is making a claim for treaty benefits on its own behalf, the hybrid entity should provide a Form W-8BEN-E to claim treaty benefits. If the hybrid entity is a flow-through entity (not a disregarded entity) claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf on a payment that is a withholdable payment, it should also provide you a Form W-8IMY (including its chapter 4 status) along with a withholding statement (if required) establishing the chapter 4 status of each of its partners or owners to determine whether withholding applies to any portion of the payment. Allocation information is not required on this withholding statement unless one or more partners or owners are subject to chapter 4 withholding. If the hybrid entity is a disregarded entity claiming treaty benefits on a payment that is a withholdable payment, unless the disregarded entity is treated as the payee for chapter 4 purposes and has its own GIIN, the single owner should provide a Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8BEN (as applicable) to you along with the Form W-8BEN-E for the hybrid entity. Line 10 of the Form W-8BEN-E may be used by the hybrid entity to associate the Forms W-8. A foreign reverse hybrid entity is an entity that is a corporation for U.S. tax purposes but is fiscally transparent under the tax laws of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. If a foreign reverse hybrid entity is receiving a payment for which the entity is claiming a reduced rate of withholding for its owners, you must obtain from the entity a Form W-8IMY (including its chapter 4 status if the payment is a withholdable payment) along with a withholding statement and documentation for each owner for which the entity claims treaty benefits. If a foreign reverse hybrid entity is receiving a withholdable payment and is not claiming treaty benefits on behalf of any of its owners, you should obtain only a Form W-8BEN-E from the entity to establish its chapter 4 status.    \\xa0 Substitute Forms W-8 for Payments of Reportable Amounts and Withholdable Payments You may develop and use your own Form W-8 (a substitute form) for chapters 3 and 4 purposes if its content is substantially similar to the IRS\\'s official Form W-8 (to the extent required by these instructions), it satisfies certain certification requirements, and it includes a signature under a penalties of perjury statement that is identical to the one stated on the official form. You may develop and use a substitute form that is in a foreign language provided that you make an English translation of the form and its contents available to the IRS upon request. You may combine multiple Forms W-8 into a single substitute form. A form that satisfies these substitute forms requirements may be treated as a similar agreed form for purposes of an applicable IGA unless the partner jurisdiction declines such treatment. A substitute form does not need to contain all of the provisions contained on the official form, so long as it contains those provisions that are relevant to the transaction for which it is furnished. You may omit the chapter 4 certifications on your substitute form if such certifications are not required based on the payments made to the payees. If you are an FFI documenting the chapter 4 status of your account holders under your chapter 4 requirements or an applicable IGA, however, you may not omit the chapter 4 certifications. If you are making a withholdable payment, you may choose to provide a substitute form that does not include all of the chapter 4 statuses provided on the Form W-8, but the substitute form must include any chapter 4 status for which withholding may apply. You may incorporate a substitute Form W-8 into other business forms you customarily use, such as account signature cards, provided the required certifications are clearly set forth. However, you may not:    Use a substitute form that requires the payee, by signing, to agree to provisions unrelated to the required certifications; or   Imply that a person may be subject to 30% withholding or backup withholding unless that person agrees to provisions on the substitute form that are unrelated to the required certifications.    \\xa0 A substitute Form W-8 is valid only if it contains the same penalties of perjury statement and certifications as the official forms and the required signature. However, if the substitute form is contained in some other business form, the words “information on this form” may be modified to refer to that portion of the business form containing the substitute form information. The design of the substitute form must be such that the information and certifications that are being attested to by the penalties of perjury statement clearly stand out from any other information contained in the form.  \\xa0 Content of Substitute Form \\xa0  Substitute Form W-8BEN. The substitute Form W-8BEN must contain all of the information required in Part I, lines 1 through 8. The certifications in Part II must be included in a substitute form only if treaty benefits are claimed, and then only to the extent that the certifications are required. For example, Form W-8BEN, line 10 (special rates and conditions), is not required if the form is being requested from an individual receiving a payment of U.S. source dividends from stocks that are actively traded on an established securities market. The substitute Form W-8BEN must include a statement that if the person providing the form is a resident in a FATCA partner jurisdiction (that is, a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction with reciprocity), certain tax account information may be provided to the jurisdiction of residence.  The substitute form must contain the penalties of perjury statement identical to the statement on the official Form W-8BEN. Additionally, if the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish your status as a non-U.S. individual and, if applicable, obtain a reduced rate of withholding.\"    Substitute Form W-8BEN-E. The substitute Form W-8BEN-E must contain all of the information required in Part I, lines 1 through 6, and lines 8 and 9 if a U.S. or foreign TIN or a GIIN is required. See however, Substitute Forms W-8 for Payments of Reportable Amounts and Withholdable Payments, earlier, for when you may omit a chapter 4 certification on a substitute Form W-8. The certifications in Part II must be included in a substitute form if you are making a withholdable payment to a disregarded entity or a branch that must be reported in Part II. The certifications in Part III must be included only if treaty benefits are claimed, and then only to the extent that the certifications are required. See Alternative Certifications Under an Applicable IGA, earlier, in these instructions, for circumstances in which the chapter 4 certifications may be replaced with alternative certifications. If the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish your status as a non-U.S. person, establish your chapter 4 status (if required), and, if applicable, obtain a reduced rate of withholding.\"    Substitute Form W-8ECI. The substitute Form W-8ECI must contain all of the information required in Part I other than line 9. The certifications in Part II of Form W-8ECI must be included in a substitute form.  If the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish your status as a non-U.S. person and that the income for which this form is provided is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.\"    Substitute Form W-8EXP. The substitute Form W-8EXP must contain all of the information required in Part I, lines 1 through 5, line 7 (if a U.S. TIN is required), and line 8. See however, Substitute Forms W-8 for Payments of Reportable Amounts and Withholdable Payments, earlier, for when you may omit a chapter 4 certification on a substitute Form W-8. The substitute Form W-8EXP must also contain all of the statements and certifications contained in Parts II and III, as applicable, with respect to the purpose for which the form is provided, but a specific statement or certification needs to be included (in its entirety) only if it is relevant to the type of entity providing the form. For example, if a withholding agent is documenting a beneficial owner that is a foreign government for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4, the withholding agent may use a substitute Form W-8EXP that contains the required information in Part I, plus the required statements and certifications from Parts II and III that are related to foreign governments, and does not need to include the statements and certifications for other types of entities that would otherwise be providing the Form W-8EXP. If the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish your status as a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession, and your chapter 4 status (if required).\"    Substitute Form W-8IMY. The substitute Form W-8IMY must contain all of the information required in Part I, lines 1 through 6, line 8 (if a U.S. TIN is required), and line 9 (if a GIIN is required). See however, Substitute Forms W-8 for Payments of Reportable Amounts and Withholdable Payments, earlier, for when you may omit a chapter 4 certification on a substitute Form W-8. The information required in Part II must be included in a substitute form if you are making a withholdable payment to a disregarded entity that has its own GIIN or a branch (including a branch that is a disregarded entity that does not have its own GIIN) operating in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction of residence of the entity named in Part I of the form. The substitute Form W-8IMY must also contain all of the statements and certifications relevant to chapter 3 contained in Parts III through VIII if you are making a payment subject to withholding under chapter 3 and the statements and certifications relevant to the chapter 4 status contained in Parts IX through XXVIII for the intermediary or flow-through entity providing the form if you are making a withholdable payment or if you are an FFI documenting your account holders for purposes of chapter 4 or an applicable IGA. For example, if the only intermediaries to which a U.S. withholding agent makes payments are qualified intermediaries that are participating FFIs, the withholding agent may use a substitute Form W-8IMY that contains only the required information from Part I (including line 9 to collect the intermediaries’ GIINs), plus the statements and certifications from Part III. A substitute Form W-8IMY must also incorporate the same attachments as the official form (such as a withholding statement and beneficial owner documentation, to the extent otherwise required). You may also include any information in a substitute Form W-8IMY, or require any information to be associated with the form, that is reasonably related to your obligation to withhold and correctly report payments.  If the substitute form is incorporated into other business forms, the following statement must be presented in the same manner as the penalties of perjury statement and must appear immediately above the single signature line: \"The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provisions of this document other than the certifications required to establish: (1) your status as a qualified intermediary, a nonqualified intermediary, a specific type of U.S. branch, a withholding foreign partnership, a withholding foreign trust, a nonwithholding foreign partnership, a nonwithholding foreign simple trust, or a nonwithholding foreign grantor trust; (2) your chapter 4 status; and/or (3) prior to January 1, 2020, your status as a qualified securities lender.\"     \\xa0 Non-IRS Form for Individuals Not Receiving Reportable Amounts If you are an FFI documenting an account holder that is an individual and you are not making a payment of a reportable amount to such account holder, you may use a non-IRS form rather than a substitute Form W-8BEN. The form must include the name and address of the individual that is the payee or beneficial owner, all countries in which the individual is resident for tax purposes, the individual’s country of birth, a taxpayer identification number, if any, for each country of residence, and the individual’s date of birth. The form may also request other information required for purposes of tax or anti-money laundering (AML) due diligence in the United States or in other countries. A form that satisfies these requirements may be treated as a similar agreed form for purposes of an applicable IGA unless the partner jurisdiction declines such treatment. Generally, a non-IRS form for individuals must contain a signed and dated certification made under penalties of perjury that the information provided on the form is accurate and will be updated by the individual within 30 days of a change in circumstances that causes the form to become incorrect. However, the signed certification provided on a form need not be signed under penalties of perjury if the form is accompanied by documentary evidence that supports the individual’s claim of foreign status. Such documentary evidence may be the same documentary evidence that is used to support foreign status in the case of a payee whose account has U.S. indicia as described in Regulations sections 1.1471-3(e) and 1.1471-4(c)(4)(i)(A).

       " '   Instructions for Form W-8BEN (07/2017)  Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner forUnited States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals)    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 07/2017       General Instructions   For definitions of terms used throughout these instructions, see Definitions, later.  \\xa0 Purpose of Form \\xa0  Establishing status for chapter 3 purposes. Foreign persons are subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of: \\xa0    Interest (including certain original issue discount (OID));   Dividends;   Rents;   Royalties;   Premiums;   Annuities;   Compensation for, or in expectation of, services performed;   Substitute payments in a securities lending transaction; or   Other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income.    \\xa0 This tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person, such as an intermediary, agent, or partnership, for the benefit of the beneficial owner. In addition, section 1446 requires a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States to withhold tax on a foreign partner\\'s distributive share of the partnership\\'s effectively connected taxable income. Generally, a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership that submits a Form W-8BEN for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will satisfy the documentation requirements under section 1446 as well. However, in some cases the documentation requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 do not match the documentation requirements of section 1446. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.   Note. The owner of a disregarded entity (including an individual), rather than the disregarded entity itself, must submit the appropriate Form W-8BEN for purposes of section 1446.  \\xa0 If you receive certain types of income, you must provide Form W-8BEN to:     Establish that you are not a U.S. person;   Claim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8BEN is being provided or a foreign partner in a partnership subject to section 1446; and   If applicable, claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding as a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty and who is eligible for treaty benefits.    \\xa0 You may also be required to submit Form W-8BEN to claim an exception from domestic information reporting and backup withholding (at the backup withholding rate under section 3406) for certain types of income that are not subject to foreign-person withholding at a rate of 30% under section 1441. Such income includes:     Broker proceeds;   Short-term (183 days or less) OID;   Bank deposit interest;   Foreign source interest, dividends, rents, or royalties; and   Proceeds from a wager placed by a nonresident alien individual in the games of blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette, or big-6 wheel.    \\xa0 A withholding agent or payer of the income may rely on a properly completed Form W-8BEN to treat a payment associated with the Form W-8BEN as a payment to a foreign person who beneficially owns the amounts paid. If applicable, the withholding agent may rely on the Form W-8BEN to apply a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding at source. Provide Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid or credited to you. Failure to provide a Form W-8BEN when requested may lead to withholding at the foreign-person withholding rate of 30% or the backup withholding rate under section 3406.   Establishing status for chapter 4 purposes. A foreign financial institution (FFI) may rely on a properly completed Form W-8BEN to establish your chapter 4 status as a foreign person. The Form W-8BEN should be provided to the FFI when requested. Failure to do so could result in 30% withholding on income paid or credited to you as a recalcitrant account holder from sources within the United States. See the definition of amounts subject to withholding, later.   Additional information. For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.    \\xa0 Who Must Provide Form W-8BEN You must give Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent or payer if you are a nonresident alien who is the beneficial owner of an amount subject to withholding, or if you are an account holder of an FFI documenting yourself as a nonresident alien. If you are the single owner of a disregarded entity, you are considered the beneficial owner of income received by the disregarded entity. Submit Form W-8BEN when requested by the withholding agent, payer, or FFI whether or not you are claiming a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding. You should also provide Form W-8BEN to a payment settlement entity (PSE) requesting this form if you are a foreign individual receiving payments subject to reporting under section 6050W (payment card transactions and third-party network transactions) as a participating payee. However, if the payments are income which is effectively connected to the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, you should instead provide the PSE with a Form W-8ECI. Do not use Form W-8BEN if you are described below.    You are a foreign entity documenting your foreign status, documenting your chapter 4 status, or claiming treaty benefits. Instead, use Form W-8BEN-E.   You are a U.S. citizen (even if you reside outside the United States) or other U.S. person (including a resident alien individual). Instead, use Form W-9 to document your status as a U.S. person.   You are acting as a foreign intermediary (that is, acting not for your own account, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian). Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.   You are a nonresident alien individual who claims exemption from withholding on compensation for independent or dependent personal services performed in the United States. Instead, provide Form 8233 or Form W-4.   You are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, unless it is allocable to you through a partnership. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI. If any of the income for which you have provided a Form W-8BEN becomes effectively connected, this is a change in circumstances and Form W-8BEN is no longer valid with respect to such income. You must file Form W-8ECI. See Change in circumstances, later.    \\xa0  Giving Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent. Do not send Form W-8BEN to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. An FFI may also request this form from you to document your account as other than a U.S. account. Give Form W-8BEN to the person requesting it before the payment is made to you, credited to your account, or allocated. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold at the 30% rate (under chapters 3 and 4), backup withholding rate, or the rate applicable under section 1446. If you receive more than one type of income from a single withholding agent for which you claim different benefits, the withholding agent may, at its option, require you to submit a Form W-8BEN for each different type of income. Generally, a separate Form W-8BEN must be given to each withholding agent.  Note. If you own the income or account jointly with one or more other persons, the income or account will be treated by the withholding agent as owned by a foreign person that is a beneficial owner of a payment only if Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E are provided by all of the owners. If the withholding agent or financial institution receives a Form W-9 from any of the joint owners, however, the payment must be treated as made to a U.S. person and the account treated as a U.S. account.  \\xa0   Expiration of Form W-8BEN. Generally, a Form W-8BEN will remain in effect for purposes of establishing foreign status for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year, unless a change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8BEN signed on September 30, 2015, remains valid through December 31, 2018.  However, under certain conditions a Form W-8BEN will remain in effect indefinitely until a change of circumstances occurs. To determine the period of validity for Form W-8BEN for purposes of chapter 4, see Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii). To determine the period of validity for Form W-8BEN for purposes of chapter 3, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii).   Change in circumstances. If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8BEN you have submitted incorrect, you must notify the withholding agent, payer, or FFI with which you hold an account within 30 days of the change in circumstances and you must file a new Form W-8BEN or other appropriate form. If you use Form W-8BEN to certify that you are a foreign person, a change of address to an address in the United States is a change in circumstances. Generally, a change of address within the same foreign country or to another foreign country is not a change in circumstances. However, if you use Form W-8BEN to claim treaty benefits, a move to the United States or outside the country where you have been claiming treaty benefits is a change in circumstances. In that case, you must notify the withholding agent, payer, or FFI within 30 days of the move. If you become a U.S. citizen or resident alien after you submit Form W-8BEN, you are no longer subject to the 30% withholding rate under section 1441 or the withholding tax on a foreign partner\\'s share of effectively connected income under section 1446. To the extent you have an account with an FFI, your account may be subject to reporting by the FFI under chapter 4. You must notify the withholding agent, payer, or FFI within 30 days of becoming a U.S. citizen or resident alien. You may be required to provide a Form W-9. For more information, see Form W-9 and its instructions.   \\xa0 You may be a U.S. resident for tax purposes depending on the number of days you are physically present in the United States over a 3-year period. See Pub. 519, available at IRS.gov/Pub519. If you satisfy the substantial presence test, you must notify the withholding agent, payer, or financial institution with which you have an account within 30 days and provide a Form W-9.   \\xa0 Definitions \\xa0  Account holder. An account holder is generally the person listed or identified as the holder or owner of a financial account. For example, if a partnership is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, then the partnership is the account holder, rather than the partners of the partnership (subject to some exceptions). However, an account that is held by a single-member disregarded entity is treated as held by the entity\\'s single owner.    Amounts subject to withholding. Generally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID).  For purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income.  Generally, an amount subject to chapter 4 withholding is an amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a). The exemptions from withholding provided for under chapter 3 are not applicable when determining whether withholding applies under chapter 4. For specific exceptions applicable to the definition of a withholdable payment, see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) (exempting, for example, certain nonfinancial payments).    Beneficial owner. For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income. Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. For purposes of section 1446, the same beneficial owner rules apply, except that under section 1446 a foreign simple trust rather than the beneficiary provides the form to the partnership. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself. Note. A payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee that is not subject to 30% withholding under chapter 3 or 4. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. For purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust or disregarded entity shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9 in its own right. Rather, the grantor or other owner shall provide the withholding agent the appropriate form.   Chapter 3. Chapter 3 means chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.   Chapter 4. Chapter 4 means chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.   Deemed-compliant FFI. Under section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN). These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f).   Disregarded entity. A business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. A disregarded entity does not submit this Form W-8BEN to a partnership for purposes of section 1446 or to an FFI for purposes of chapter 4. Instead, the owner of such entity provides appropriate documentation. See Regulations section 1.1446-1 and section 1.1471-3(a)(3)(v), respectively.  Certain entities that are disregarded for U.S. tax purposes may be recognized for purposes of claiming treaty benefits under an applicable tax treaty (see the definition of hybrid entity below). A hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits is required to complete Form W-8BEN-E. See Form W-8BEN-E and its instructions.   Financial account. A financial account includes:     A depository account maintained by a financial institution;   A custodial account maintained by a financial institution;   Equity or debt interests (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market) in investment entities and certain holding companies, treasury centers, or financial institutions as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e);   Cash value insurance contracts; and   Annuity contracts.    For purposes of chapter 4, exceptions are provided for accounts such as certain tax-favored savings accounts; term life insurance contracts; accounts held by estates; escrow accounts; and annuity contracts. These exceptions are subject to certain conditions. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2). Accounts may also be excluded from the definition of financial account under an applicable IGA.    Financial institution. A financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts.   Foreign financial institution (FFI). An FFI generally means a foreign entity that is a financial institution.   Foreign person. A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual and certain foreign entities that are not U.S. persons (entities should complete Form W-8BEN-E rather than this Form W-8BEN).    Hybrid entity. A hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of its status under the Code but is not treated as fiscally transparent by a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. Hybrid status is relevant for claiming treaty benefits.   Intergovernmental agreement (IGA). An IGA means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, see the list of jurisdictions at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx.  A Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI. A Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that has entered into an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is a participating FFI, but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI.   Nonresident alien individual. Any individual who is not a citizen or resident alien of the United States is a nonresident alien individual. An alien individual meeting either the \"green card test\" or the \"substantial presence test\" for the calendar year is a resident alien. Any person not meeting either test is a nonresident alien individual. Additionally, an alien individual who is treated as a nonresident alien pursuant to Regulations section 301.7701(b)-7 for purposes figuring the individual\\'s U.S. tax liability, or an alien individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or American Samoa is a nonresident alien individual. See Pub. 519 for more information on resident and nonresident alien status.   \\xa0 Even though a nonresident alien individual married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien may choose to be treated as a resident alien for certain purposes (for example, filing a joint income tax return), such individual is still treated as a nonresident alien for chapter 3 withholding tax purposes on all income except wages. For purposes of chapter 4, a nonresident alien individual who holds a joint account with a U.S. person will be considered a holder of a U.S. account for chapter 4 purposes.   Participating FFI. A participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term \"participating FFI\" also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a qualified intermediary (QI) branch of a U.S. financial institution, unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI.    Participating payee. A participating payee means any person that accepts a payment card as payment or accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization in settlement of a third-party network transaction.    Payment settlement entity (PSE). A PSE is a merchant acquiring entity or third-party settlement organization. Under section 6050W, a PSE is generally required to report payments made in settlement of payment card transactions or third-party network transactions. However, a PSE is not required to report payments made to a beneficial owner that is documented as foreign with an applicable Form W-8.    Recalcitrant account holder. A recalcitrant account holder includes an individual who fails to comply with the requests of an FFI for documentation and information for determining the U.S. or foreign status of the individual’s account, including furnishing this Form W-8BEN when requested.   U.S. person. A U.S. person is defined in section 7701(a)(30) and includes an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States. For purposes of chapter 4, a U.S. person is defined in Regulations section 1.1471-1(b)(141).   Withholding agent. Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or 4 withholding is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies. For purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent may be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.       Specific Instructions    \\xa0 Part I  Line 1. Enter your name. If you are a foreign individual who is the single owner of a disregarded entity that is not claiming treaty benefits as a hybrid entity, with respect to a payment, you should complete this form with your name and information. If the account to which a payment is made or credited is in the name of the disregarded entity, you should inform the withholding agent of this fact. This may be done by including the name and account number of the disregarded entity on line 7 (reference number) of the form. However, if the disregarded entity is claiming treaty benefits as a hybrid entity, it should complete Form W-8BEN-E instead of this Form W-8BEN.   Line 2. Enter your country of citizenship. If you are a dual citizen, enter the country where you are both a citizen and a resident at the time you complete this form. If you are not a resident in any country in which you have citizenship, enter the country where you were most recently a resident. However, if you are a U. S. citizen, you should not complete this form even if you hold citizenship in another jurisdiction. Instead, provide Form W-9.    Line 3. Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for purposes of that country’s income tax. If you are completing Form W-8BEN to claim a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty, you must determine your residency in the manner required by the treaty. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes. If you do not have a tax residence in any country, your permanent residence is where you normally reside. If you reside in a country that does not use street addresses, you may enter a descriptive address on line 3. The address must accurately indicate your permanent residence in the manner used in your jurisdiction.    Line 4. Enter your mailing address only if it is different from the address you show on line 3.    Line 5. If you have a social security number (SSN), enter it here. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5 from a Social Security Administration (SSA) office or online at www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf. If you are in the United States, you can call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213. Complete Form SS-5 and return it to the SSA.  If you do not have an SSN and are not eligible to get one, you can get an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). To apply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 with the IRS. It usually takes 4–6 weeks to get an ITIN. To claim certain treaty benefits, you must complete line 5 by submitting an SSN or ITIN, or line 6 by providing a foreign tax identification number (foreign TIN).  \\xa0 An ITIN is for tax use only. It does not entitle you to social security benefits or change your employment or immigration status under U.S. law.  A partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States will likely be allocated effectively connected taxable income. The partner is required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and must have a U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN).  You must provide an SSN or TIN if you are:    Claiming an exemption from withholding under section 871(f) for certain annuities received under qualified plans, or   Submitting the form to a partnership that conducts a trade or business in the United States.     \\xa0 If you are claiming treaty benefits, you are generally required to provide an ITIN if you do not provide a tax identifying number issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence on line 6. However, an ITIN is not required to claim treaty benefits relating to:     Dividends and interest from stocks and debt obligations that are actively traded;   Dividends from any redeemable security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (mutual fund);   Dividends, interest, or royalties from units of beneficial interest in a unit investment trust that are (or were upon issuance) publicly offered and are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933; and   Income related to loans of any of the above securities.     \\xa0   Line 6. If you are providing this Form W-8BEN to document yourself as an account holder with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the TIN issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence identified on line 3 unless:    You have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs), or   You are a resident of a U.S. possession.    \\xa0 If you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 6, and you are not a resident of a U.S. possession, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation for why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. The explanation may be written on line 6, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If you are writing the explanation on line 6, you may shorten it to \"not legally required.\" Do not write \"not applicable.\"  In addition, if you are not using this form to document a financial account described above, you may provide the TIN issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence on line 6 for purposes of claiming treaty benefits (rather than providing a U.S. TIN on line 5, if required).    Line 7. This line may be used by the filer of Form W-8BEN or by the withholding agent to whom it is provided to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its obligations. For example, withholding agents who are required to associate the Form W-8BEN with a particular Form W-8IMY may want to use line 7 for a referencing number or code that will make the association clear. A beneficial owner can use line 7 to include the number of the account for which he or she is providing the form. A foreign single owner of a disregarded entity can use line 7 to inform the withholding agent that the account to which a payment is made or credited is in the name of the disregarded entity (see the instructions for line 1).    Line 8. If you are providing this Form W-8BEN to document yourself as an account holder with respect to a financial account as described above in line 6 that you hold with a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI), provide your date of birth. Use the following format to input your information: MM-DD-YYYY. For example, if you were born on April 15, 1956, you would enter 04-15-1956.    \\xa0 Part II  Line 9. If you are claiming treaty benefits as a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty for payments subject to withholding under chapter 3, identify the country where you claim to be a resident for income tax treaty purposes. For treaty purposes, a person is a resident of a treaty country if the person is a resident of that country under the terms of the treaty. A list of U.S. tax treaties is available at IRS.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Tax-Treaties.  \\xa0 If you are related to the withholding agent within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b) and the aggregate amount subject to withholding received during the calendar year exceeds $500,000, then you are generally required to file Form 8833, Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b), available at IRS.gov/Form8833. See the Instructions for Form 8833 for more information on the filing requirements.    Line 10. Line 10 must be used only if you are claiming treaty benefits that require that you meet conditions not covered by the representations you make on line 9 and Part III. For example, persons claiming treaty benefits on royalties must complete this line if the treaty contains different withholding rates for different types of royalties. However, this line should always be completed by foreign students and researchers claiming treaty benefits. See Scholarship and fellowship grants, later, for more information.  This line is generally not applicable to treaty benefits under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty.    Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident alien individual can use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a \"saving clause\" which preserves or \"saves\" the right of each country to tax its own residents as if no tax treaty existed. Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the recipient has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes. The individual must use Form W-9 to claim the tax treaty benefit. See the instructions for Form W-9 for more information. Also see Nonresident alien student or researcher who becomes a resident alien, later, for an example.   Scholarship and fellowship grants. A nonresident alien student (including a trainee or business apprentice) or researcher who receives noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship income can use Form W-8BEN to claim benefits under a tax treaty that apply to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on such income. No Form W-8BEN is required unless a treaty benefit is being claimed. A nonresident alien student or researcher who receives compensatory scholarship or fellowship income must use Form 8233, instead of Form W-8BEN, to claim any benefits of a tax treaty that apply to that income. The student or researcher must use Form W-4 for any part of such income for which he or she is not claiming a tax treaty withholding exemption. Do not use Form W-8BEN for compensatory scholarship or fellowship income. See Compensation for Dependent Personal Services in the Instructions for Form 8233.   \\xa0 If you are a nonresident alien individual who received noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship income and personal services income (including compensatory scholarship or fellowship income) from the same withholding agent, you may use Form 8233 to claim a tax treaty withholding exemption for part or all of both types of income.  \\xa0 Completing lines 3 and 9. Most tax treaties that contain an article exempting scholarship or fellowship grant income from taxation require that the recipient be a resident of the other treaty country at the time of, or immediately prior to, entry into the United States. Thus, a student or researcher may claim the exemption even if he or she no longer has a permanent address in the other treaty country after entry into the United States. If this is the case, you can provide a U.S. address on line 3 and still be eligible for the exemption if all other conditions required by the tax treaty are met. You must also identify on line 9 the tax treaty country of which you were a resident at the time of, or immediately prior to, your entry into the United States.   \\xa0 Completing line 10. You must complete line 10 if you are a student or researcher claiming an exemption from taxation on your noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship grant income under a tax treaty.   \\xa0 Nonresident alien student or researcher who becomes a resident alien. You must use Form W-9 to claim an exception to a saving clause. See Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien, earlier, for a general explanation of saving clauses and exceptions to them.   Example. Article 20 of the United States-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first protocol to the United States-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would complete Form W-9.    \\xa0 Part III Form W-8BEN must be signed and dated by the beneficial owner of the amount subject to withholding or the account holder of an FFI (or an agent with legal authority to act on the person’s behalf). If Form W-8BEN is completed by an agent acting under a duly authorized power of attorney for the beneficial owner or account holder, the form must be accompanied by the power of attorney in proper form or a copy thereof specifically authorizing the agent to represent the principal in making, executing, and presenting the form. Form 2848 can be used for this purpose. The agent, as well as the beneficial owner or account holder, may incur liability for the penalties provided for an erroneous, false, or fraudulent form. A withholding agent may allow you to provide this form with an electronic signature. The electronic signature must indicate that the form was electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and statement that the form has been electronically signed). Simply typing your name into the signature line is not an electronic signature.  \\xa0 If any information on Form W-8BEN becomes incorrect, you must submit a new form within 30 days unless you are no longer an account holder of the requester that is an FFI and you will not receive a future payment with respect to the account.  Broker transactions or barter exchanges. Income from transactions with a broker or a barter exchange is subject to reporting rules and backup withholding unless Form W-8BEN or a substitute form is filed to notify the broker or barter exchange that you are an exempt foreign person.  You are an exempt foreign person for a calendar year in which:    You are a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, partnership, estate, or trust;   You are an individual who has not been, and does not plan to be, present in the United States for a total of 183 days or more during the calendar year; and   You are neither engaged, nor plan to be engaged during the year, in a U.S. trade or business that has effectively connected gains from transactions with a broker or barter exchange.    \\xa0        Instructions for Form W-8BEN - Notices     \\xa0    Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.    We ask for the information on this form to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States. You are required to provide the information.

       " '   Instructions for Form W-8BEN-E (07/2017)  Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner forUnited States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities)    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 07/2017       General Instructions   For definitions of terms used throughout these instructions, see Definitions, later.  \\xa0 Purpose of Form This form is used by foreign entities to document their statuses for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4, as well as for certain other Code provisions as described later in these instructions. Foreign persons are subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of:    Interest (including certain original issue discount (OID));   Dividends;   Rents;   Royalties;   Premiums;   Annuities;   Compensation for, or in expectation of, services performed;   Substitute payments in a securities lending transaction; or   Other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income.    \\xa0 This tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441 or 1442 on that amount. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person, such as an intermediary, agent, or partnership, for the benefit of the beneficial owner. In addition, section 1446 requires a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States to withhold tax on a foreign partner’s distributive share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. Generally, a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership that submits a Form W-8 for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will satisfy the documentation requirements under section 1446 as well. However, in some cases the documentation requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 do not match the documentation requirements of section 1446. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6. A withholding agent or payer of the income may rely on a properly completed Form W-8BEN-E to treat a payment associated with the Form W-8BEN-E as a payment to a foreign person who beneficially owns the amounts paid. If applicable, the withholding agent may rely on the Form W-8BEN-E to apply a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding. If you receive certain types of income, you must provide Form W-8BEN-E to:    Claim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8BEN-E is being provided or a partner in a partnership subject to section 1446; and   If applicable, claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding as a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty.    \\xa0 You may also use Form W-8BEN-E to identify income from a notional principal contract that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States to establish the exception to reporting such income on Form 1042-S. See Regulations section 1.1461-1(c)(2)(ii)(F). Form W-8BEN-E may also be used to claim exemption from withholding for portfolio interest pursuant to section 881(c). The portfolio interest exemption does not apply to payments of interest for which the recipient is a 10 percent shareholder of the payer or to payments of interest received by a controlled foreign corporation from a related person. See sections 881(c)(3) and 881(c)(5). A future version of this form may require that persons receiving interest payments to which this form relates identify any obligation with respect to which they have one of these prohibited relationships. You may also be required to submit Form W-8BEN-E to claim an exception from domestic information reporting on Form 1099 and backup withholding (at the backup withholding rate under section 3406) for certain types of income. Such income includes:    Broker proceeds.   Short-term (183 days or less) original issue discount (short-term OID).   Bank deposit interest.   Foreign source interest, dividends, rents, or royalties.    \\xa0 Provide Form W-8BEN-E to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid or credited to you. Failure to provide a Form W-8BEN-E when requested may lead to withholding at a 30% rate or the backup withholding rate in certain cases when you receive a payment to which backup withholding applies. In addition to the requirements of chapter 3, chapter 4 requires withholding agents to identify the chapter 4 status of entities that are payees receiving withholdable payments. A withholding agent may request this Form W-8BEN-E to establish your chapter 4 status and avoid withholding at a 30% rate on such payments. Chapter 4 also requires participating FFIs and certain registered deemed-compliant FFIs to document their entity account holders in order to determine their chapter 4 statuses regardless of whether withholding applies to any payments made to the entities. If you are an entity maintaining an account with an FFI, the FFI may request that you provide this Form W-8BEN-E in order to document your chapter 4 status.  Additional information. For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.   \\xa0 Who Must Provide Form W-8BEN-E You must give Form W-8BEN-E to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign entity receiving a withholdable payment from a withholding agent, receiving a payment subject to chapter 3 withholding, or if you are an entity maintaining an account with an FFI requesting this form. Do not use Form W-8BEN-E if:    You are a U.S. person (including U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and entities treated as U.S. persons, such as a corporation organized under the law of a state). Instead, use Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification.   You are a foreign insurance company that has made an election under section 953(d) to be treated as a U.S. person. Instead, provide a withholding agent with Form W-9 to certify to your U.S. status even if you are considered an FFI for purposes of chapter 4.   You are a nonresident alien individual. Instead, use Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals), or Form 8233, Exemption From Withholding on Compensation for Independent (and Certain Dependent) Personal Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual, as applicable.   You are a disregarded entity, branch, or flow-through entity for U.S. tax purposes. However, you may use this form if you are a disregarded entity or flow-through entity using this form either solely to document your chapter 4 status (because you hold an account with an FFI) or, if you are a disregarded entity or a partnership, to claim treaty benefits because you are a hybrid entity liable to tax as a resident for treaty purposes. See Special Instructions for Hybrid Entities, later. A flow-through entity may also use this form for purposes of documenting itself as a participating payee for purposes of section 6050W. If you are a disregarded entity with a single owner or branch of an FFI, the single owner, if such owner is a foreign person, should provide Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (as appropriate). If the single owner is a U.S. person, a Form W-9 should be provided. If you are a partnership, you should provide a Form W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting.   You are acting as an intermediary (that is, acting not for your own account, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian), a qualified intermediary (including a qualified intermediary acting as a qualified derivatives dealer), or a qualified securities lender (QSL). Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.   You are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, unless it is allocable to you through a partnership. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person’s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States. If any of the income for which you have provided a Form W-8BEN-E becomes effectively connected, this is a change in circumstances and the Form W-8BEN-E is no longer valid.   You are filing for a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Instead, provide Form W-8EXP, Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting, to certify to your exemption and identify your chapter 4 status. However, you should provide Form W-8BEN-E if you are claiming treaty benefits, and you may provide this form if you are only claiming you are a foreign person exempt from backup withholding or documenting your chapter 4 status. For example, a foreign tax-exempt organization under section 501(c) receiving royalty income that is not exempt because it is taxable as unrelated business income but that is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding under a royalty article of a tax treaty should provide Form W-8BEN-E. You should use Form W-8ECI if you are receiving effectively connected income (for example, income from commercial activities that is not exempt under an applicable section of the Code).   You are a foreign reverse hybrid entity transmitting documentation provided by your interest holders to claim treaty benefits on their behalf. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. A foreign reverse hybrid entity also may not use this form to attempt to claim treaty benefits on its own behalf. See Foreign Reverse Hybrid Entities, later.   You are a withholding foreign partnership or a withholding foreign trust within the meaning of sections 1441 and 1442 and the accompanying regulations. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.   You are a foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust providing documentation for purposes of section 1446. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY and accompanying documentation.   You are a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution that is an FFI (other than a qualified intermediary branch) under an applicable Model 1 IGA. For purposes of identifying yourself to withholding agents, you may submit Form W-9 to certify to your U.S. status.    \\xa0  Giving Form W-8BEN-E to the withholding agent. Do not send Form W-8BEN-E to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. An FFI may also request this form from you to document the status of your account.   When to provide Form W-8BEN-E to the withholding agent. Give Form W-8BEN-E to the person requesting it before the payment is made to you, credited to your account, or allocated. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold at the 30% rate (as applicable under chapters 3 or 4), backup withholding rate, or the rate applicable under section 1446. If you receive more than one type of income from a single withholding agent for which you claim different benefits, the withholding agent may, at its option, require you to submit a Form W-8BEN-E for each type of income. Generally, a separate Form W-8BEN-E must be given to each withholding agent.   \\xa0 Note. If you own the income with one or more other persons, the income will be treated by the withholding agent as owned by a foreign person that is a beneficial owner of a payment only if Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable document) is provided by each of the owners. An account will be treated as a U.S. account for chapter 4 purposes by an FFI requesting this form if any of the account holders is a specified U.S. person or a U.S.-owned foreign entity (unless the account is otherwise excepted from U.S. account status for chapter 4 purposes).    Change in circumstances. If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8BEN-E you have submitted incorrect for purposes of either chapter 3 or chapter 4, you must notify the withholding agent or financial institution maintaining your account within 30 days of the change in circumstances by providing the documentation required in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E)(2). See Regulations sections 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for the definition of change in circumstances for purposes of chapter 3, and 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E) for purposes of chapter 4.    \\xa0 With respect to an FFI claiming a chapter 4 status under an applicable IGA, a change in circumstances includes when the jurisdiction where the FFI is organized or resident (or the jurisdiction identified in Part II of the form) was included on the list of jurisdictions treated as having an intergovernmental agreement in effect and is removed from that list or when the FATCA status of the jurisdiction changes (for example, from Model 2 to Model 1). The list of agreements is maintained at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx.  Expiration of Form W-8BEN-E. Generally, a Form W-8BEN-E will remain valid for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4 for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year, unless a change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8BEN signed on September 30, 2014, remains valid through December 31, 2017.  However, under certain conditions a Form W-8BEN-E will remain in effect indefinitely absent a change of circumstances. See Regulations sections 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii) and 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii) for the period of validity for chapters 3 and 4 purposes, respectively.     \\xa0 Definitions  Account holder. An account holder is generally the person listed or identified as the holder or owner of a financial account. For example, if a partnership is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, then the partnership is the account holder, rather than the partners of the partnership. However, an account that is held by a disregarded entity (other than a disregarded entity treated as an FFI for chapter 4 purposes) is treated as held by the entity\\'s single owner.   Amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding. Generally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. Amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding do not include amounts that are not FDAP, such as most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID).  For purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income.    Beneficial owner. For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income.  Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself.  For purposes of section 1446, the same beneficial owner rules apply, except that under section 1446 a foreign simple trust rather than the beneficiary provides the form to the partnership. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself.  \\xa0 Note. A payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee that is not subject to 30% withholding for purposes of chapters 3 and 4. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. For purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust or disregarded entity shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9 in its own right. Rather, the grantor or other owner shall provide the withholding agent the appropriate form.    Chapter 3. Chapter 3 means chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.   Chapter 4. Chapter 4 means chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.   Chapter 4 status. The term chapter 4 status means a person’s status as a U.S. person, specified U.S. person, foreign individual, participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, restricted distributor, exempt beneficial owner, nonparticipating FFI, territory financial institution, excepted NFFE, or passive NFFE.    Deemed-compliant FFI. Under section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a GIIN. These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1).    Disregarded entity. A business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. Generally, a disregarded entity does not submit this Form W-8BEN-E to a withholding agent. Instead, the owner of such entity provides the appropriate documentation (for example, a Form W-8BEN-E if the owner is a foreign entity). However, if a disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment is an FFI outside the single owner’s country of organization or has its own GIIN, its foreign owner will be required to complete Part II of Form W-8BEN-E to document the chapter 4 status of the disregarded entity receiving the payment.  Certain entities that are disregarded for U.S. tax purposes may be treated as treaty residents for purposes of claiming treaty benefits under an applicable tax treaty or may be recognized as FFIs under an applicable IGA. A hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf is required to complete Form W-8BEN-E. See Hybrid Entities under Special Instructions, later. A disregarded entity with a U.S. owner or a disregarded entity with a foreign owner that is not otherwise able to fill out Part II (that is, because it is in the same country as its single owner and does not have a GIIN) may provide this form to an FFI solely for purposes of documenting itself for chapter 4 purposes. In such a case, the disregarded entity should complete Part I as if it were a beneficial owner and should not complete line 3.   Financial account. A financial account includes:     A depository account maintained by an FFI;   A custodial account maintained by an FFI;   Equity or debt interests (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market) in investment entities and certain holding companies, treasury centers, or financial institutions as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(e);   Certain cash value insurance contracts; and   Annuity contracts.    \\xa0 For purposes of chapter 4, exceptions are provided for accounts such as certain tax-favored savings accounts, term life insurance contracts, accounts held by estates, escrow accounts, and certain annuity contracts. These exceptions are subject to certain conditions. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2). Accounts may also be excluded from the definition of financial account under an applicable IGA.   Financial institution. A financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(e). An investment entity organized in a territory that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company is not treated as a financial institution. Instead, it is a territory NFFE. If such an entity cannot qualify as an excepted NFFE as described in Regulations section 1.1472-1(c)(1) (including an excepted territory NFFE), it must disclose its substantial U.S. owners using this definition (applying the 10 percent threshold) under Regulations section 1.1473-1(b)(1).    Foreign financial institution (FFI). A foreign financial institution (FFI) means a foreign entity that is a financial institution.    Fiscally transparent entity. An entity is treated as fiscally transparent with respect to an item of income for which treaty benefits are claimed to the extent that the interest holders in the entity must, on a current basis, take into account separately their shares of an item of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed, and must determine the character of the items of income as if they were realized directly from the sources from which realized by the entity. For example, partnerships, common trust funds, and simple trusts or grantor trusts are generally considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to items of income received by them.   Flow-through entity. A flow-through entity is a foreign partnership (other than a withholding foreign partnership), a foreign simple or foreign grantor trust (other than a withholding foreign trust), or, for payments for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, any entity to the extent the entity is considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to the payment by an interest holder’s jurisdiction.    Foreign person. A foreign person includes a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign person.    GIIN. The term GIIN means a global intermediary identification number. A GIIN is the identification number assigned to an entity that has registered with the IRS for chapter 4 purposes.    Hybrid entity. A hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of its status under the Code but is not treated as fiscally transparent by a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. Hybrid entity status is relevant for claiming treaty benefits. A hybrid entity is required to provide its chapter 4 status if it is receiving a withholdable payment.    Intergovernmental agreement (IGA). An intergovernmental agreement (IGA) means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, see www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx. A Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI. A Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that has entered into an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is a participating FFI but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI.  The term reporting IGA FFI refers to both reporting Model 1 FFIs and reporting Model 2 FFIs.   Nonparticipating FFI. A nonparticipating FFI means an FFI that is not a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or exempt beneficial owner.   Nonreporting IGA FFI. A nonreporting IGA FFI is an FFI that is a resident of, or located or established in, a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that meets the requirements of:    A nonreporting financial institution described in a specific category in Annex II of the Model 1 or Model 2 IGA;   A registered deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(A) through (F);    A certified deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(2)(i) through (v); or    An exempt beneficial owner described in Regulations section 1.1471-6.    \\xa0   Participating FFI. A participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term participating FFI also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI.   Participating payee. A participating payee means any person that accepts a payment card as payment or accepts payment from a third party settlement organization in settlement of a third party network transaction for purposes of section 6050W.   Payee. A payee is generally a person to whom a payment is made regardless of whether such person is the beneficial owner. For a payment made to a financial account, the payee is generally the holder of the financial account. See Regulations sections 1.1441-1(b)(2) and 1.1471-3(a)(3).   Payment settlement entity (PSE). A payment settlement entity is a merchant acquiring entity or third party settlement organization. Under section 6050W, a PSE is generally required to report payments made in settlement of payment card transactions or third party network transactions. However, a PSE is not required to report payments made to a beneficial owner that is documented as foreign with an applicable Form W-8.    Qualified intermediary (QI). A qualified intermediary (QI) is a person that is a party to an agreement with the IRS that is described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii). A qualified derivatives dealer (QDD) is a QI that has agreed to certain reporting and withholding requirements pursuant to Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6).   Recalcitrant account holder. A recalcitrant account holder includes an entity (other than an entity required to be treated as a nonparticipating FFI) that fails to comply with a request by an FFI maintaining the account for documentation and information for determining whether the account is a U.S. account. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(g).    Reverse hybrid entity. A reverse hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is not fiscally transparent under U.S. tax law principles but that is fiscally transparent under the laws of a jurisdiction with which the United States has an income tax treaty. See Form W-8IMY and the accompanying instructions for information on a reverse hybrid entity making a claim of treaty benefits on behalf of its owners.    Specified U.S. person. A specified U.S. person is any U.S. person other than a person identified in Regulations section 1.1473-1(c).    Substantial U.S. owner. A substantial U.S. owner (as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(b)) means any specified U.S. person that:    Owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent (by vote or value) of the stock of any foreign corporation;   Owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the profits or capital interests in a foreign partnership;   Is treated as an owner of any portion of a foreign trust under sections 671 through 679; or   Holds, directly or indirectly, more than a 10 percent beneficial interest in a trust.     \\xa0   U.S. person. A U.S. person is defined in section 7701(a)(30) and includes domestic partnerships, corporations, and trusts.  \\xa0 Certain foreign insurance companies issuing annuities or cash value insurance contracts that elect to be treated as a U.S. person for federal tax purposes but are not licensed to do business in the United States are treated as FFIs for purposes of chapter 4. For purposes of providing a withholding agent with documentation for both chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes, however, such an insurance company is permitted to use Form W-9 to certify its status as a U.S. person. Likewise, a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution (other than a branch that operates as a qualified intermediary) that is treated as an FFI under an applicable IGA is permitted to use Form W-9 to certify its status as a U.S. person for chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes.   Withholdable payment. A withholdable payment is defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a). For exceptions applicable to the definition of a withholdable payment, see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) (for example, certain nonfinancial payments).    Withholding agent. Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or 4 withholding is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies.  For purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent may be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.        Specific Instructions    \\xa0 Part I – Identificationof Beneficial Owner  Line 1. Enter your name. If you are a disregarded entity or branch, do not enter your business name. Instead, enter the legal name of your owner (or, if you are a branch, the entity that you form a part of) (looking through multiple disregarded entities if applicable). If you are a disregarded entity that is a hybrid entity filing a treaty claim, however, see Hybrid entities under Special Instructions, later.  \\xa0 If you are an account holder providing this form to an FFI solely for purposes of documenting yourself as an account holder and you are not receiving a withholdable payment or reportable amount (as defined in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(3)(vi)), you should complete Part I by substituting the references to \"beneficial owner\" with \"account holder.\"   \\xa0 The named holder on the account is not necessarily the account holder for purposes of chapter 4. See Definitions, earlier, or, for an account maintained by an FFI covered by a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA with respect to the account, the definition of account holder in an applicable IGA to determine if you are the account holder. If you hold an account with an FFI and are unsure whether the definition of \"account holder\" under an IGA is applicable to your account, consult with the FFI requesting this form.   Line 2. If you are a corporation, enter your country of incorporation. If you are another type of entity, enter the country under whose laws you are created, organized, or governed.    Line 3. If you are a disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment, enter your name on line 3 if you: 1) have registered with the IRS and been assigned a GIIN associated with the legal name of the disregarded entity; 2) are a reporting Model 1 FFI or reporting Model 2 FFI; and 3) are not a hybrid entity using this form to claim treaty benefits.    \\xa0 If you are not required to provide the legal name of the disregarded entity, you may want to notify the withholding agent that you are a disregarded entity receiving a payment or maintaining an account by indicating the name of the disregarded entity on line 10. If you wish to report the name of a disregarded entity holding an account with the withholding agent requesting this form for only information purposes (that is, the disregarded entity is not reported on line 1 or in Part II of this form), you may enter the disregarded entity\\'s name on line 3.  Line 4. Check the one box that applies. By checking a box, you are representing that you qualify for the classification indicated. You must check the box that represents your classification (for example, corporation, partnership, trust, estate, etc.) under U.S. tax principles (not under the law of a treaty country). If you are providing Form W-8BEN-E to an FFI solely for purposes of documenting yourself for chapter 4 purposes as an account holder of an account maintained by an FFI, you do not need to complete line 4. If you are a partnership, disregarded entity, simple trust, or grantor trust receiving a payment for which treaty benefits are being claimed by such entity, you must check the \"Partnership,\" \"Disregarded entity,\" \"Simple trust,\" or \"Grantor trust\" box. For such a case, you must also check the \"yes\" box to indicate that you are a hybrid entity making a treaty claim. You may only check the \"no\" box if (1) you are a disregarded entity, partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust and are using the form solely for purposes of documenting yourself as an account holder of an FFI and the form is not associated with a withholdable payment or a reportable amount or (2) you are using this form solely for purposes of documenting your status as a participating payee for purposes of section 6050W. In such cases, you are not required to complete line 4, but you may check the \"no\" box if you choose to complete line 4. You may also use Form W-8IMY to document yourself as an account holder of an FFI.  \\xa0 Only entities that are tax-exempt under section 501(c) should check the \"Tax-exempt organization\" box for purposes of line 4. Such organizations should use Form W-8BEN-E only if they are claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty or a Code exception other than section 501(c) or if they are using this form solely for purposes of documenting themselves as an account holder with an FFI. However, if you are a private foundation you should check “Private Foundation” instead of \"Tax-exempt organization.\"    Line 5. Check the one box that applies to your chapter 4 status. You are only required to provide a chapter 4 status on this form if you are the payee of a withholdable payment or are documenting the status of a financial account you hold with an FFI requesting this form. By checking a box on this line, you are representing that you qualify for this classification in your country of residence.   \\xa0 For most of the chapter 4 statuses, you are required to complete an additional part of this form certifying that you meet the conditions of the status indicated on line 5. Complete the required portion of this form before signing and providing it to the withholding agent. See Entities Providing Certifications Under an Applicable IGA under Special Instructions, later.   \\xa0 FFIs Covered by an IGA and Related Entities A reporting IGA FFI resident in, or established under the laws of, a jurisdiction covered by a Model 1 IGA should check \"Reporting Model 1 FFI.\" A reporting FFI resident in, or established under the laws of, a jurisdiction covered by a Model 2 IGA should check \"Reporting Model 2 FFI.\" If you are treated as a registered deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA, you should check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI\" rather than \"registered deemed-compliant FFI\" and provide your GIIN. In general, if you are treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI under an applicable IGA, you should check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI\" even if you meet the qualifications for deemed-compliant status or are an exempt beneficial owner under the chapter 4 regulations. In such a case, you should not also check your applicable status under the regulations but should provide your GIIN on line 9, if applicable. If you are an owner-documented FFI that is treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI under an applicable IGA you must check \"Owner-documented FFI\" and complete Part X. An FFI that is related to a reporting IGA FFI and that is treated as a nonparticipating FFI in its country of residence should check \"Nonparticipating FFI\" in line 5. If you are an FFI in a jurisdiction treated as having an IGA in effect, you should not check \"Participating FFI\" but rather should check \"Reporting Model 1 FFI\" or \"Reporting Model 2 FFI\" as applicable. See www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx  for a list of jurisdictions treated as having an IGA in effect.   \\xa0 Non-Profit Organizations Covered by an IGA If you are a non-profit entity that is established and maintained in a jurisdiction treated as having an IGA in effect and you meet the definition of \"active NFFE\"under Annex I of the applicable IGA, you should not check a box on line 5 if you are providing this form to an FFI for purposes of documenting yourself as an account holder. Instead, you should provide a certification of your status under the IGA. See Entities Providing Certifications Under an Applicable IGA under Special Instructions, later.   \\xa0 Account That Is Not a Financial Account If you are providing this form to document an account you hold with a foreign financial institution that is not a financial account under Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2), check the \"Account that is not a financial account\" box on line 5.  Line 6. Enter the permanent residence address of the entity identified in line 1. Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for purposes of that country’s income tax. If you are giving Form W-8BEN-E to claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding under an income tax treaty, you must determine residency in the manner required by the treaty. Do not show the address of a financial institution (unless you are a financial institution providing your own address), a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless it is the only address you use and it appears in your organizational documents (that is, your registered address). If you do not have a tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is where you maintain your principal office.    Line 7. Enter your mailing address only if it is different from the address on line 6.    Line 8. Enter your U.S. employer identification number (EIN). An EIN is a U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN) for entities. If you do not have a U.S. EIN, apply for one on Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, if you are required to obtain a U.S. TIN.  A partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States will likely be allocated effectively connected taxable income. The partner is required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and must have a TIN.  You must provide a U.S. TIN if you are:     Claiming an exemption from withholding under section 871(f) for certain annuities received under qualified plans, or   Claiming benefits under an income tax treaty and have not provided a foreign TIN on line 9b.    \\xa0 However, a TIN is not required to be shown in order to claim treaty benefits on the following items of income:     Dividends and interest from stocks and debt obligations that are actively traded;   Dividends from any redeemable security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (mutual fund);   Dividends, interest, or royalties from units of beneficial interest in a unit investment trust that are (or were upon issuance) publicly offered and are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933; and   Income related to loans of any of the above securities.    \\xa0 See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vii) for other circumstances when you are required to provide a U.S. TIN.  \\xa0 If you need an EIN, you are encouraged to apply for one online instead of submitting a paper Form SS-4. For more information, visit IRS.gov/EIN.   Line 9a. If you are a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a sponsored FFI described in the Treasury regulations), reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, direct reporting NFFE, trustee of a trustee-documented trust that is a foreign person providing this form for the trust, or sponsored direct reporting NFFE, you are required to enter your GIIN (with regard to your country of residence) on line 9a. If you are a trustee of a trustee-documented trust and you are a foreign person, you should provide the GIIN that you received when you registered as a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI. If your branch is receiving the payment and is required to be identified in Part II, you are not required to provide a GIIN on line 9a. Instead, provide the GIIN of your branch (if applicable) on line 13.  You must provide your GIIN on line 9 if you are a nonreporting IGA FFI that is (1) treated as registered deemed-compliant under Annex II to an applicable Model 2 IGA or (2) a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1).  \\xa0 If you are in the process of registering with the IRS as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a sponsored FFI), reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, direct reporting NFFE, sponsored direct reporting NFFE, or nonreporting IGA FFI but have not received a GIIN, you may complete this line by writing “applied for.” However, the person requesting this form from you must receive and verify your GIIN within 90 days.   Line 9b. If you are providing this Form W-8BEN-E to document yourself as an account holder with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the TIN issued to you by the jurisdiction in which you are a tax resident identified on line 6 unless:    You have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs) , or    You properly identified yourself as a government, central bank of issue, or international organization on line 4, or you are a resident of a U.S. possession.    \\xa0 If you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 9b, and you are not a government, central bank of issue, international organization, or resident of a U.S. possession, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. The explanation may be written on line 9b, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If you are writing the explanation on line 9b, you may shorten it to \"not legally required.\" Do not write “not applicable.”  In addition, if you are not using this form to document a financial account described above, you may provide the TIN issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence on line 9b for purposes of claiming treaty benefits (rather than providing a U.S. TIN on line 6b, if required).  \\xa0 Lines 9a and 9b should accommodate the GIIN or foreign TIN, as appropriate. You may need to use a smaller font when completing the form. If the GIIN or foreign TIN does not fit in the space provided, you may provide a GIIN or foreign TIN that is indicated and clearly identified somewhere else on the form, or on a separate attached sheet, as long as the GIIN or foreign TIN is clearly identified as being furnished with respect to line 9a or 9b, respectively. For example, a handwritten GIIN located just outside of line 9a with a corresponding arrow pointing to line 9a is a properly provided GIIN for this purpose.   Line 10. This line may be used by you or by the withholding agent or FFI to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent to document the beneficial owner. For example, withholding agents who are required to associate the Form W-8BEN-E with a particular Form W-8IMY may want to use line 10 for a referencing number or code that will make the association clear. You may also want to use line 10 to include the number of the account for which you are providing the form. If you are a single owner of a disregarded entity you may use line 10 to inform the withholding agent that the account to which a payment is made or credited is held in the name of the disregarded entity (unless the name of the disregarded entity is required to be provided on line 3).  You may also use line 10 to identify income from a notional principal contract that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.      \\xa0 Part II – Disregarded Entityor Branch Receiving Payment Complete Part II for a disregarded entity that has its own GIIN and is receiving a withholdable payment, or for a branch (including a branch that is a disregarded entity that does not have a GIIN) operating in a jurisdiction other than the country of residence identified in line 2. For example, assume ABC Co., which is a participating FFI resident in Country A, operates through a branch in Country B (which is a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction) and the branch is treated as a reporting Model 1 FFI under the terms of the Country B Model 1 IGA. ABC Co. should not enter its GIIN on line 9, and the Country B branch should complete this Part II by identifying itself as a reporting Model 1 IGA FFI and providing its GIIN on line 13. If the Country B branch receiving the payment is a disregarded entity you may be required to provide its legal name on line 3.  \\xa0 If the disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment has its own GIIN, Part II should be completed regardless of whether it is in the same country as the single owner identified in Part I. If you have multiple branches/disregarded entities receiving payments from the same withholding agent and the information in Part I is the same for each branch/disregarded entity that will receive payments, a withholding agent may accept a single Form W-8BEN-E from you with a schedule attached that includes all of the Part II information for each branch/disregarded entity rather than separate Forms W-8BEN-E to identify each branch/disregarded entity receiving payments associated with the form and an allocation of the payment to each branch/disregarded entity.  Line 11. Check the one box that applies. If no box applies to the disregarded entity, you do not need to complete this part. If you check reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, or participating FFI, you must complete line 13 (see below). If your branch is a branch of a reporting IGA FFI that cannot comply with the requirements of an applicable IGA or the regulations under chapter 4 (a related entity), you must check \"Branch treated as nonparticipating FFI.\"   Line 12. Enter the address of the branch or disregarded entity.    Line 13. If you are a reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, or participating FFI, you must enter the GIIN on line 13 of your branch that receives the payment. If you are a disregarded entity that completed Part I, line 3 of this form and are receiving payments associated with this form, enter your GIIN. Do not enter your GIIN on line 9. If you are a U.S. branch, enter a GIIN applicable to any other branch of the FFI (including in its residence country).   \\xa0 If you are in the process of registering your branch with the IRS but have not received a GIIN, you may complete this line by writing \"applied for.\" However, the person requesting this form from you must receive and verify your GIIN within 90 days.   \\xa0 Part III – Claim of Tax Treaty Benefits  Line 14a. If you are claiming a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding under an income tax treaty you must enter the country where you are a resident for income tax treaty purposes and check the box to certify that you are a resident of that country.   Line 14b. If you are claiming a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding under an income tax treaty you must check the box to certify that you:    Derive the item of income for which the treaty benefit is claimed, and   Meet the limitation on benefits provision contained in the treaty, if any.    \\xa0 An item of income may be derived by either the entity receiving the item of income or by the interest holders in the entity or, in certain circumstances, both. An item of income paid to an entity is considered to be derived by the entity only if the entity is not fiscally transparent under the laws of the entity’s jurisdiction with respect to the item of income. An item of income paid to an entity shall be considered to be derived by the interest holder in the entity only if:     The interest holder is not fiscally transparent in its jurisdiction with respect to the item of income, and   The entity is considered to be fiscally transparent under the laws of the interest holder’s jurisdiction with respect to the item of income. An item of income paid directly to a type of entity specifically identified in a treaty as a resident of a treaty jurisdiction is treated as derived by a resident of that treaty jurisdiction.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Limitation on benefits treaty provisions. If you are a resident of a foreign country that has entered into an income tax treaty with the United States that contains a limitation on benefits (LOB) article, you must complete one of the checkboxes in line 14b. You may only check a box if the limitation on benefits article in that treaty includes a provision that corresponds to the checkbox on which you are relying to claim treaty benefits. A particular treaty might not include every type of test for which a checkbox is provided. For example, \"Company that meets the derivative benefits test\" is generally not available to a company resident in a treaty country that is not a member of the EU, EEA, or NAFTA. In addition, each treaty LOB article that contains a specific test listed below may have particular requirements that must be met that differ from the requirements in another treaty with regard to the same test. Accordingly, you must check the relevant treaty LOB article for the particular requirements associated with each test. In general, only one LOB checkbox is required to claim a treaty exemption even if more than one checkbox would suffice to claim the benefits of the treaty for that item of income. Each of the tests is summarized below for your general convenience but may not be relied upon for making a final determination that you meet an LOB test. Rather you must check the text of the LOB article itself to determine which tests are available under that treaty and the particular requirements of those tests. See Table 4, Limitation on Benefits, at IRS.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Tax-Treaty-Tables, for a summary of the major tests within the Limitation on Benefits article that are relevant for documenting any entity\\'s claim for treaty benefits.    Government—this test is met if the entity is the Contracting State, political subdivision, or local authority.   Tax-exempt pension trust or pension fund—this test generally requires that more than half the beneficiaries or participants in the trust or fund be residents of the country of residence of the trust or fund itself.   Other tax-exempt organization—this test generally requires that more than half the beneficiaries, members, or participants of religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, cultural, or educational organizations be residents of the country of residence of the organization.   Publicly-traded corporation—this test generally requires the corporation\\'s principal class of shares to be primarily and regularly traded on a recognized stock exchange in its country of residence, while other treaties may permit trading in either the United States or the treaty country, or in certain third countries if the primary place of management is the country of residence.   Subsidiary of publicly-traded corporation—this test generally requires that more than 50% of the vote and value of the company\\'s shares be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer companies that are publicly-traded corporations and that themselves meet the publicly-traded corporation test, as long as all companies in the chain of ownership are resident in either the United States or the same country of residence as the subsidiary.   Company that meets the ownership and base erosion test—this test generally requires that more than 50% of the vote and value of the company\\'s shares be owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals, governments, tax-exempt entities, and publicly-traded corporations resident in the same country as the company, as long as all companies in the chain of ownership are resident in the same country of residence, and less than 50% of the company\\'s gross income is accrued or paid, directly or indirectly, to persons who would not be good shareholders for purposes of the ownership test.   Company that meets the derivative benefits test—this test is generally limited to NAFTA, EU, and EEA country treaties, and may apply to all benefits or only to certain items of income (interest, dividends, and royalties). It generally requires that more than 95% of the aggregate vote and value of the company\\'s shares be owned, directly or indirectly, by seven or fewer equivalent beneficiaries (ultimate owners who are resident in an EU, EEA, or NAFTA country and are entitled to identical benefits under their own treaty with the United States under one of the ownership tests included within the LOB article (other than the stock ownership and base erosion test)). In addition, this test requires that less than 50% of the company\\'s gross income be paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, to persons who would not be equivalent beneficiaries.   Company with an item of income that meets the active trade or business test—this test generally requires that the company be engaged in an active trade or business in its country of residence, that its activities in that country be substantial in relation to its U.S. activities, if the payer is a related party, and the income be derived in connection to or incidental to that trade or business.   Favorable discretionary determination received—this test requires that the company obtain a favorable determination granting benefits from the U.S. competent authority that, despite the company\\'s failure to meet a specific objective LOB test in the applicable treaty, it may nonetheless claim the requested benefits. Unless a treaty or technical explanation specifically provides otherwise, you may not claim discretionary benefits while your claim for discretionary benefits is pending.   Other—for other LOB tests that are not listed above (for example, a headquarters test). Identify the other test relied upon, or enter N/A if the treaty has no LOB article. For example, if you meet the headquarters test under the United States-Netherlands income tax treaty, you should write \"Headquarters test, Article 26(5)\" in the space provided.    \\xa0 If an entity is claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf, it should complete Form W-8BEN-E. If an interest holder in an entity that is considered fiscally transparent in the interest holder’s jurisdiction is claiming a treaty benefit, the interest holder should complete Form W-8BEN (if an individual) or Form W-8BEN-E (if an entity) on its own behalf as the appropriate treaty resident, and the fiscally transparent entity should associate the interest holder’s Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E with a Form W-8IMY completed by the fiscally transparent entity (see Hybrid entities under Special Instructions, later).  \\xa0 An income tax treaty may not apply to reduce the amount of any tax on an item of income received by an entity that is treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. tax purposes. Therefore, neither the domestic corporation nor its shareholders are entitled to the benefits of a reduction of U.S. income tax on an item of income received from U.S. sources by the corporation.  \\xa0 If you are an entity that derives the income as a resident of a treaty country, you may check this box if the applicable income tax treaty does not contain a \"limitation on benefits\" provision.   Line 14c. If you are a foreign corporation claiming treaty benefits under an income tax treaty that entered into force before January 1, 1987 (and has not been renegotiated) on (1) U.S. source dividends paid to you by another foreign corporation or (2) U.S. source interest paid to you by a U.S. trade or business of another foreign corporation, you must generally be a \"qualified resident\" of a treaty country. See section 884 for the definition of interest paid by a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation (\"branch interest\") and other applicable rules. In general, a foreign corporation is a qualified resident of a country if any of the following apply:    It meets a 50% ownership and base erosion test.   It is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in its country of residence or the United States.   It carries on an active trade or business in its country of residence.   It gets a ruling from the IRS that it is a qualified resident.     See Regulations section 1.884-5 for the requirements that must be met to satisfy each of these tests.  \\xa0 If you are claiming treaty benefits under an income tax treaty entered into force after December 31, 1986, do not check box 14c. Instead, check box 14b.    Line 15. Line 15 must be used only if you are claiming treaty benefits that require that you meet conditions not covered by the representations you make in line 14 (or other certifications on the form). This line is generally not applicable to claiming treaty benefits under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty or other income article, unless such article requires additional representations. For example, certain treaties allow for a zero rate on dividends for certain qualified residents provided that additional requirements are met, such as ownership percentage, ownership period, and that the resident meet a combination of tests under an applicable LOB article. You should indicate the specific treaty article and paragraph or subparagraph, as applicable. You should also use this space to set out the requirements you meet under the identified treaty article. The following are examples of persons who should complete this line:    Exempt organizations claiming treaty benefits under the exempt organization articles of the treaties with Canada, Mexico, Germany, and the Netherlands.   Foreign corporations that are claiming a preferential rate applicable to dividends based on ownership of a specific percentage of stock in the entity paying the dividend and owning the stock for a specified period of time. Such persons should provide the percentage of ownership and the period of time they owned the stock. For example, under the United States-Italy treaty, to claim the 5% dividend rate, the Italian corporation must own 25% of the voting stock for a 12-month period.  In addition, for example, if you qualify for and are claiming a zero rate on dividend payments under Article 10(3) of the United States-Germany income tax treaty, you should fill out line 15 with \"Article 10(3),\" \"0,\" and \"dividends\" in the spaces provided. In the space provided for an explanation, you may write that you are the beneficial owner of the dividends, you are a resident of Germany, you have directly owned shares representing 80% or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for the 12-month period ending on the date the entitlement to the dividend is determined, and that you satisfy the conditions of Article 28(2)(f)(aa) and (bb) and Article 28(4) of the treaty with respect to the dividends.   Persons claiming treaty benefits on royalties if the treaty contains different withholding rates for different types of royalties.   Persons claiming treaty benefits on interest other than the generally applicable rate. For example, under the United States-Australia treaty, the generally applicable interest rate is 10% under Article 11(2). However, interest may be exempt from withholding if the specific conditions under Article 11(3) are met.    \\xa0    \\xa0 Parts IV Through XXVIII –Certification of Chapter 4 Status You should complete only one part of Parts IV through XXVIII certifying to your chapter 4 status (if required).

For example, indicate \"investment entity wholly owned by exempt beneficial owners\" rather than \"exempt beneficial owner.\" If you are a nonreporting IGA FFI claiming a deemed-compliant status under the regulations, you must instead indicate on this line which section of the regulations you qualify under. If you are a nonreporting financial institution under an applicable IGA because you qualify as an owner-documented FFI under the regulations, do not check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI.\" Instead, you must check \"Owner-documented FFI\" and complete Part X rather than this Part XII.

       " '   Instructions for Form W-8ECI (07/2017) Certificate of Foreign Person\\'s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 07/2017     General Instructions  Note.  For definitions of terms used throughout these instructions, see Definitions, later.      Purpose of Form Foreign persons are generally subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources. However, no withholding under section 1441 or 1442 is required on income that is, or is deemed to be, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and is includible in the beneficial owner\\'s gross income for the tax year.  This withholding exemption does not apply to personal services income and income subject to withholding under section 1445 (dispositions of U.S. real property interests) or section 1446 (foreign partner\\'s share of effectively connected income). Income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States is not a withholdable payment under chapter 4 and thus is not subject to withholding under sections 1471 or 1472. If you receive effectively connected income from sources in the United States, you must provide Form W-8ECI to:   Establish that you are not a U.S. person, Claim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8ECI is being provided or are an entity engaged in a U.S. trade or business submitting Form W-8ECI on behalf of your owners, partners, or beneficiaries, and Claim that the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.    If you expect to receive both income that is effectively connected and income that is not effectively connected from a withholding agent, you must provide Form W-8ECI for the effectively connected income and Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8EXP, or Form W-8IMY (as appropriate) for income that is not effectively connected. If you submit Form W-8ECI to a partnership, the income claimed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business is subject to withholding under section 1446. If a nominee holds an interest in a partnership on your behalf, you, not the nominee, must submit the form to the partnership or nominee that is the withholding agent. If you are a foreign partnership, a foreign simple trust, or a foreign grantor trust with effectively connected income, you can submit Form W-8ECI without attaching Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, or other documentation for your foreign partners, beneficiaries, or owners. A withholding agent or payer of the income can rely on a properly completed Form W-8ECI to treat the payment associated with the Form W-8ECI as a payment to a foreign person who beneficially owns the amounts paid and is either entitled to an exemption from withholding under sections 1441, 1442, 1471, or 1472 because the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States or subject to withholding under section 1446. Provide Form W-8ECI to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid, credited, or allocated to you. Failure by a beneficial owner to provide a Form W-8ECI when requested may lead to withholding at the 30% rate or the backup withholding rate under section 3406.   Additional information.  For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E,  W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.       Who Must Provide Form W-8ECI You must give Form W-8ECI to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign person and you are the beneficial owner of U.S. source income that is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or are an entity (including a foreign partnership or foreign trust) engaged in a U.S. trade or business submitting this form on behalf of your owners, partners, or beneficiaries. Do not use Form W-8ECI if:   You are a nonresident alien individual who claims exemption from withholding on compensation for independent or certain dependent personal services performed in the United States. Instead, provide Form 8233 or Form W-4. You are the beneficial owner of a payment subject to withholding and are claiming an exemption from withholding for a reason other than a claim that the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. For example, if you are a foreign person who is the beneficial owner of U.S. source income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and you are claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty in effect, do not use Form W-8ECI. Instead, provide Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E. You are a foreign person receiving proceeds from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest. Instead, see Form 8288-B. You are filing for a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Instead, provide Form W-8EXP. However, you should use Form W-8BEN-E if you are claiming treaty benefits or are providing the form only to claim exempt recipient status for backup withholding purposes. You should use Form W-8ECI, however, if you received effectively connected income (for example, income from commercial activities).  You are acting as an intermediary (acting not for your own account or for that of your partners, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian) or qualified intermediary with respect to a payment subject to withholding. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. You are a foreign partnership or foreign trust acting in your capacity as a withholding foreign partnership or a withholding foreign trust for purposes of sections 1441, 1442, and 1471 through 1474.  A withholding foreign partnership is, generally, a foreign partnership that has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS under which it agrees to assume primary withholding responsibility for each partner\\'s distributive share of income subject to withholding that is paid to the partnership. A withholding foreign trust is, generally, a foreign simple trust or a foreign grantor trust that has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS under which it agrees to assume primary withholding responsibility for each beneficiary\\'s or owner\\'s distributive share of income subject to withholding that is paid to the trust. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. You are a foreign corporation that is a personal holding company receiving compensation described in section 543(a)(7). Such compensation is not exempt from withholding as effectively connected income but can be exempt from withholding on another basis. You are a foreign partner in a partnership and the income allocated to you from the partnership is effectively connected with the conduct of the partnership\\'s trade or business in the United States. Instead, provide Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable). However, if you made or will make an election under section 871(d) or 882(d), provide Form W-8ECI. In addition, if you are otherwise engaged in a trade or business in the United States and you want your allocable share of income from the partnership to be subject to withholding under section 1446, provide Form W-8ECI.     Giving Form W-8ECI to the withholding agent.  Do not send Form W-8ECI to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. Give Form W-8ECI to the person requesting it before the payment is made, credited, or allocated. If you do not provide Form W-8ECI, the withholding agent can have to withhold at the 30% rate or the backup withholding rate. A separate Form W-8ECI generally must be given to each withholding agent.    U.S. branch of foreign bank or insurance company.  A payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or a foreign insurance company that is subject to U.S. regulation by the Federal Reserve Board or state insurance authorities is presumed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States if the withholding agent has an EIN provided by the branch. The presumption does not apply if the branch provides a withholding agent with a Form W-8BEN-E for the income.     Expiration of Form W-8ECI.  Generally, a Form W-8ECI will remain valid for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year, unless a change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8ECI signed on September 30, 2017, generally remains valid through December 31, 2020.     Change in circumstances.  If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8ECI you have submitted incorrect, you must notify the withholding agent or payer within 30 days of the change in circumstances and you must file a new Form W-8ECI or other appropriate form. For example, if during the tax year any part or all of the income is no longer effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, your Form W-8ECI is no longer valid. You must notify the withholding agent and provide Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY. See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for the definition of a change in circumstances for purposes of chapter 3, and Regulations section 1.1471-(c)(6)(ii)(E) for purposes of chapter 4.       Definitions  Beneficial owner.  For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the income in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income. Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent. The beneficial owners of a foreign grantor trust (a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. Generally, these beneficial owner rules apply for purposes of sections 1441, 1442, and 1446, except that section 1446 requires a foreign simple trust to provide a Form W-8 on its own behalf rather than on behalf of the beneficiary of such trust. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself. A payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. However, for purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9. Instead, the grantor or other owner must provide Form W-8 or Form W-9 as appropriate.    Chapter 3.  Chapter 3 means chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.    Chapter 4.  Chapter 4 means chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.    Disregarded entity.  A business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. A disregarded entity does not submit Form W-8ECI to a partnership for purposes of section 1446. Instead, the owner of such entity provides the appropriate documentation. See Regulations section 1.1446-1.    Effectively connected income.  Generally, when a foreign person engages in a trade or business in the United States, all income from sources in the United States other than fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income (for example, interest, dividends, rents, and certain similar amounts) is considered income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. FDAP income may or may not be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Factors to be considered to determine whether FDAP income and similar amounts from U.S. sources are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business include whether:   The income is from assets used in, or held for use in, the conduct of that trade or business, or The activities of that trade or business were a material factor in the realization of the income.    There are special rules for determining whether income from securities is effectively connected with the active conduct of a U.S. banking, financing, or similar business. See section 864(c)(4)(B)(ii) and Regulations section 1.864-4(c)(5)(ii) for more information. Effectively connected income, after allowable deductions, is taxed at graduated rates applicable to U.S. persons and resident aliens, rather than at the 30% rate. You must report this income on your annual U.S. income tax or information return.  A partnership that has effectively connected income allocable to foreign partners is generally required to withhold tax under section 1446. The withholding tax rate on a partner\\'s share of effectively connected income is 35% for corporate partners and 39.6% for all other taxable partners. In certain circumstances the partnership can withhold tax at the highest applicable rate to a particular type of income (for example, long-term capital gain allocated to a noncorporate partner). Any amount withheld under section 1446 on your behalf, and reflected on Form 8805 issued by the partnership to you, can be credited on your U.S. income tax return.    Foreign person.  A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other person that’s not a U.S. person.    Nonresident alien individual.  Any individual who is not a citizen or resident alien of the United States is a nonresident alien individual. An alien individual meeting either the \"green card test\" or the \"substantial presence test\" for the calendar year is a resident alien. Any person not meeting either test is a nonresident alien individual. Additionally, an alien individual who is treated as a nonresident alien pursuant to Regulations section 301.7701(b)-7 for purposes of computing the individual\\'s U.S. tax liability, or an alien individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or American Samoa is a nonresident alien individual.  See Pub. 519 for more information on resident and nonresident alien status including information about the \"green card test\" and \"substantial presence test.\"                 Even though a nonresident alien individual married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien can choose to be treated as a resident alien for certain purposes (for example, filing a joint income tax return), such individual is still treated as a nonresident alien for withholding tax purposes on all income except wages.    Withholding agent.  Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 withholding is a withholding agent. For purposes of chapter 4, any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of a withholdable payment is a withholding agent. The withholding agent can be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches treated as U.S. person.  Generally, the person who pays (or causes to be paid) an amount subject to withholding to the foreign person (or to its agent) must withhold. For purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent can be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.    Withholdable payment.  A withholdable payment means any payment of U.S. source FDAP income, subject to certain exemptions described in Regulations sections 1.1471-2(b) and 1.1473-1(a). However, no exceptions to withholding on U.S. source FDAP income for purposes other than chapter 4 apply when determining whether a payment is a withholdable payment. For example, an exclusion from an amount subject to withholding under Regulations section 1.1441-2(a) does not apply for purposes of determining whether a payment constitutes a withholdable payment. Under chapter 4, a payment of effectively connected income is not a withholdable payment.    U.S. person.  A U.S. person is defined in section 7701(a)(30) and includes an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, as well as domestic partnerships, corporations, trusts, and estates.      Specific Instructions    Part I  Line 1.  Enter your name. If you are providing this form for a disregarded entity with a single owner who is a foreign person, this form should be completed and signed by the foreign single owner. If the account to which a payment is made or credited is in the name of the disregarded entity, the foreign single owner can inform the withholding agent of this fact by including the name of the disregarded entity on line 3 of Part I of the form.    If you own the income or account jointly with one or more other persons, the income or account will be treated by the withholding agent as owned by a foreign person if Forms W-8ECI are provided by all of the owners. If the withholding agent receives a Form W-9 from any of the joint owners the payment must be treated as made to a U.S. person.    Line 2.  If you are providing this form for a corporation, enter the country of incorporation. If you are filing for another type of entity, enter the country under whose laws the entity is created, organized, or governed. If you are an individual, provide your country of residence for tax purposes.     Line 3.  If you are providing this form for a disregarded entity, enter the name of the disregarded entity receiving the payment. This line is not required but can assist the withholding agent that is making a payment to you. The withholding agent can request additional referencing information (such as your account number) which should be entered on line 9. When completing this form, do not provide information concerning the disregarded entity on any line other than this line 3 or line 9. Instead, you should complete the form using the information of the owner of the disregarded entity.    Line 4.  Check the box that applies. By checking a box, you are representing that you qualify for this classification. You must check the one box that represents your classification (for example, corporation, partnership, etc.) under U.S. tax principles. If more than one classification applies to you, select the most specific status available. For example, if you are a private foundation, you are also considered a tax-exempt organization, and you should check the box for private foundation rather than the box for tax-exempt organization.    Line 5.  Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for that country\\'s income tax. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless such address is the registered address of an entity identified on line 1 which does not have another address in the jurisdiction. If you are an individual who does not have a tax residence in any country, your permanent residence is where you normally reside. If you are not an individual and you do not have a tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is where you maintain your principal office.    Line 6.  Enter your business address in the United States. Do not show a post office box.    Line 7.  Enter your  U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN). A U.S.TIN is a social security number (SSN), employer identification number (EIN), or IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Check the appropriate box for the type of U.S. TIN you are providing. You are required to provide a TIN for this form to be valid. If you are an individual, you are generally required to enter your SSN. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5 from a Social Security Administration (SSA) office or online at www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf. If in the United States, you can call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213. Fill in Form SS-5 and return it to the SSA. If you do not have an SSN and are not eligible to get one, you must get an ITIN. To apply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 with the IRS. It usually takes 4-6 weeks to get an ITIN. If you are not an individual (for example, if you are a foreign estate or trust), or you are an individual who is an employer or who is engaged in a U.S. trade or business as a sole proprietor, use Form SS-4 to obtain an EIN. If you are a disregarded entity, enter the U.S. TIN of your foreign single owner.    You can also apply for an EIN online. For more information, visit IRS.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online.    Line 8.  If you are providing this Form W-8ECI to document yourself as an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on a Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the tax identifying number (TIN) issued to you by your jurisdiction of tax residence identified on line 5 unless:  You have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs), or  You properly identified yourself as a government, central bank of issue, or international organization on line 4.     If you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 8 and you are not a government, central bank of issue, or international organization, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN.  For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence.  The explanation may be written on line 8, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form.  If you are writing the explanation on line 8, you can shorten it to \"not legally required.\"  Do not write \"not applicable.\"    Line 9.  You or the withholding agent requesting this form can use this line to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its obligations. For example, you can use line 9 to include the name and number of the account for which you are providing the form.    Line 10.  If you are providing this Form W-8ECI to document yourself as an account holder with respect to a financial account (as described in line 8 above) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI), provide your date of birth if you are an individual.  Use the following format to input your information: MM-DD-YYYY.  For example, if you were born on April 15, 1975, you would enter 04-15-1975.    Line 11.  You must specify the items of income that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. You will generally have to provide Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8EXP, or Form W-8IMY for those items from U.S. sources that are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.  If you are providing this form to a partnership because you are a partner and have made an election under section 871(d) or section 882(d), attach a copy of the election to the form. If you have not made the election, but intend to do so effective for the current tax year, attach a statement to the form indicating your intent. See Regulations section 1.871-10(d)(3).        Part II  Signature.  Form W-8ECI must be signed and dated by the beneficial owner of the income, or, if the beneficial owner is not an individual, by an authorized representative or officer of the beneficial owner. If an authorized representative or agent is completing Form W-8ECI on behalf of the beneficial owner of the income, the representative or agent must check the box to certify that he or she has the legal capacity to sign for the person identified on line 1. If Form W-8ECI is completed by an agent acting under a duly authorized power of attorney for the beneficial owner, the form must be accompanied by the power of attorney in proper form or a copy thereof specifically authorizing the agent to represent the principal in making, executing, and presenting the form. This requirement does not apply to a partnership or other flow-through entity submitting this form with respect to a payment of effectively connected income that is beneficially owned by the entity’s partners or owners. Form 2848 can be used for this purpose. The agent, as well as the beneficial owner, can incur liability for the penalties provided for an erroneous, false, or fraudulent form. A withholding agent can allow you to provide this form with an electronic signature.  The electronic signature must indicate that the form was electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and statement that the form has been electronically signed).  Simply typing your name into the signature line is not an electronic signature.    If any information on Form W-8ECI becomes incorrect, you must submit a correct new form within 30 days to the requester of this form unless you will not receive a future payment from the withholding agent that would require an updated Form W-8.

       " '   Instructions for Form W-8EXP (07/2017) Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 07/2017     General Instructions  Future developments.  For the latest information about developments related to Form W-8EXP and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/FormW8EXP.      What’s New These instructions have been updated to reflect temporary and final regulations under chapters 3 and 4 published in January 2017. These instructions include additional information on when a foreign TIN is required to be included on Form W-8EXP. In addition, these instructions include information about the use of electronic signatures.     Purpose of Form Under chapter 3, foreign persons are subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of interest (including certain original issue discount (OID)), dividends, rents, premiums, annuities, compensation for, or in expectation of, services performed, or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income. This tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441 or 1442 on that amount. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person for the benefit of the beneficial owner. Foreign persons are also subject to tax at graduated rates on income they earn that is considered effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person invests in a partnership that conducts a U.S. trade or business, the foreign person is considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The partnership is required to withhold tax under section 1446 on the foreign person’s distributive share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. If you receive certain types of income, you must provide Form W-8EXP to:   Establish that you are not a U.S. person; Claim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8EXP is given; and Claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding as a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession.    In general, payments to a foreign government (including a foreign central bank of issue wholly-owned by a foreign sovereign) from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, other domestic securities, financial instruments held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy, and interest on deposits in banks in the United States are exempt from tax under section 892 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Payments other than those described above, including income derived in the U.S. from the conduct of a commercial activity, income received from a controlled commercial entity (including gain from the disposition of any interest in a controlled commercial entity), and income received by a controlled commercial entity, do not qualify for exemption from tax under section 892 or exemption from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. See Temporary Regulations section 1.892-3T. In addition, certain distributions to a foreign government from a real estate investment trust (REIT) may not be eligible for relief from withholding and may be subject to withholding at 35% of the gain realized. For the definition of \"commercial activities,\" see Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T. Amounts allocable to a foreign person from a partnership’s trade or business in the United States are considered derived from a commercial activity in the United States. The partnership\\'s net effectively connected taxable income is subject to withholding under section 1446. In general, payments to an international organization from investment in the United States in stocks, bonds and other domestic securities, interest on deposits in banks in the United States, and payments from any other source within the United States are exempt from tax under section 892 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. See Temporary Regulations section 1.892-6T. Payments to a foreign central bank of issue (whether or not wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) or to the Bank for International Settlements from obligations of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or from interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business, are also generally exempt from tax under section 895 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. In addition, payments to a foreign central bank of issue from bankers’ acceptances are exempt from tax under section 871(i)(2)(C) and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Effectively connected income or gain from a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States may be subject to withholding under section 1446. Payments to a foreign tax-exempt organization of certain types of U.S. source income are also generally exempt from tax and exempt from withholding. Gross investment income of a foreign private foundation, however, is subject to withholding under section 1443(b) at a rate of 4%. Effectively connected income or gain from a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States may be subject to withholding under section 1446. Payments to a government of a possession of the United States are generally exempt from tax and withholding under section 115(2). To establish eligibility for exemption from 30% tax and withholding for chapter 3 purposes under sections 892, 895, 501(c), or 115(2), a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession must provide a Form W-8EXP to a withholding agent or payer with all necessary documentation. The withholding agent or payer of the income may rely on a properly completed Form W-8EXP to treat the payment, credit, or allocation associated with the Form W-8EXP as being made to a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession exempt from withholding at the 30% rate (or, where appropriate, subject to withholding at a 4% rate). Provide Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid, credited, or allocated to you. Failure by a beneficial owner to provide a Form W-8EXP when requested may lead to withholding at the 30% rate, the backup withholding rate, or the rate applicable under section 1446. In addition to the requirements of chapter 3, chapter 4 requires withholding agents to identify chapter 4 status of payees receiving withholdable payments to determine whether withholding applies under chapter 4. Under chapter 4, certain foreign governments, foreign central banks, international organizations, and foreign entities described in section 501(c) (other than an insurance company described in section 501(c)(15)) are not subject to withholding under chapter 4. A withholding agent may request this Form W-8EXP to establish your chapter 4 status and avoid withholding. Chapter 4 also requires participating FFIs and certain registered deemed-compliant FFIs to document entity account holders in order to determine their chapter 4 status regardless of whether withholding applies to any payments made to the entities. If you maintain an account with an FFI and have a chapter 4 status shown in Part I, line 4 of this form, provide this Form W-8EXP when requested by the FFI in order to document your chapter 4 status.  Additional information.  For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.    Who must provide Form W-8EXP.  You must give Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession receiving a withholdable payment or receiving a payment subject to chapter 3 withholding, or are such an entity maintaining an account with an FFI requesting this form.  Do not use Form W-8EXP if:   You are not a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession receiving amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E, or Form W-8ECI. For example, if you are a foreign tax-exempt organization claiming a benefit under an income tax treaty, provide Form W-8BEN-E. You are receiving withholdable payments from a withholding agent requesting this form and you do not have a chapter 4 status identified in Part I, line 4 of this form. You are acting as an intermediary (that is, acting not for your own account, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian). Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. You are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI. You are a tax-exempt organization receiving unrelated business taxable income subject to withholding under section 1443(a). Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8ECI (as applicable) for this portion of your income.  You are a foreign partnership, a foreign simple trust, or a foreign grantor trust. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY. However, a foreign grantor trust is required to provide documentation of its grantor or other owner for purposes of section 1446. See Regulations section 1.1446-1.       Giving Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent.  Do not send Form W-8EXP to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this person will be the one from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. Generally, a separate Form W-8EXP must be given to each withholding agent.  Give Form W-8EXP to the person requesting it before the payment is made, credited, or allocated to you or your account. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold tax at the chapter 3 or chapter 4 30% rate, the backup withholding rate (determined under section 3406), or the rate applicable under section 1446. If you receive more than one type of income from a single withholding agent, the withholding agent may require you to submit a Form W-8EXP for each different type of income.    Expiration of Form W-8EXP.  Generally, a Form W-8EXP remains in effect indefinitely until a change of circumstances makes any information provided on the form incorrect. In some cases, however, Form W-8EXP will remain valid only for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year. For example, a Form W-8EXP provided on February 15, 2015, by a controlled entity of a foreign government would be subject to the three-year validity period and thus would expire on December 31, 2018, for chapter 3 purposes. For more exceptions to the indefinite validity period, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii) for chapter 3 purposes and Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii) for chapter 4 purposes.    Change in circumstances.  If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8EXP you have submitted incorrect, you must notify the withholding agent within 30 days of the change in circumstances and you must file a new Form W-8EXP or other appropriate form.       Definitions  Amounts exempt from tax under section 895.  Section 895 generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income a foreign central bank of issue receives from obligations of the United States (or of any agency or instrumentality thereof) or from interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business unless such obligations or deposits are held for, or used in connection with, the conduct of commercial banking functions or other commercial activities of the foreign central bank of issue.    Amounts exempt from tax under section 892.  Only a foreign government or an international organization as defined below qualifies for exemption from taxation under section 892. Section 892 generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income a foreign government receives from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, or other domestic securities; financial instruments held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy; and interest on deposits in banks in the United States of monies belonging to the foreign government. Income of a foreign government from any of the following sources is not exempt from U.S. taxation.   The conduct of any commercial activity. A controlled commercial entity. The disposition of any interest in a controlled commercial entity. For the definition of \"commercial activity,\" see Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T.    Section 892 also generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income of an international organization received from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, or other domestic securities and interest on deposits in banks in the United States of monies belonging to the international organization or from any other source within the United States.    Amounts subject to withholding.  Generally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID). For purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. Generally, an amount subject to chapter 4 withholding is an amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a) to which an exception does not apply under chapter 4. The exemptions from withholding or taxation provided for under chapter 3 are not applicable when determining whether withholding applies under chapter 4. For exceptions applicable to the definition of a withholdable payment, see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) (exempting, for example, certain nonfinancial payments).    Beneficial owner.  For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income. Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself. These beneficial owner rules apply primarily for purposes of withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. The rules also generally apply for purposes of section 1446, with a few exceptions. See Regulations section 1.1446-1 for instances where the documentation requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 differ from section 1446.    Chapter 3.  Chapter 3 means Chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.    Chapter 4.  Chapter 4 means Chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.    Commercial activities.  For purposes of chapter 4, commercial activities are financial activities of a type engaged in by an insurance company, custodial institution, or depository institution (including the act of accepting deposits). An exempt beneficial owner will not be considered exempt for chapter 4 purposes with respect to payments derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity. See Regulations section 1.1471-6(h), including limitations on the scope of a commercial financial activity. For purposes of chapter 3, commercial activities are described in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T.    Controlled commercial entity.  A controlled commercial entity is an entity engaged in commercial activities described in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T (whether within or outside the United States) if the foreign government holds:  Any interest in the entity that is 50% or more of the total of all interests in the entity, or A sufficient interest or any other interest in the entity which provides the foreign government with effective practical control of the entity.    An entity includes a corporation, a partnership, a trust (including a pension trust), and an estate. A partnership’s commercial activities are attributable to its general and limited partners for purposes of determining whether the partner is a controlled commercial entity for purposes of section 892. The partnership’s activities will result in the partnership having to withhold tax under section 1446 on commercial income that is the effectively connected taxable income allocable to a foreign government partner.   Note. A foreign central bank of issue will be treated as a controlled commercial entity only if it engages in commercial activities within the United States.       Chapter 4 status.  The term chapter 4 status means a person’s status as a U.S. person, specified U.S. person, foreign individual, participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, restricted distributor, exempt beneficial owner, nonparticipating FFI, territory financial institution, excepted nonfinancial foreign entity (NFFE), or passive NFFE. See Regulations section 1.1471-1(b) for the definitions of these terms.    Deemed-compliant FFI.  Under section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN). These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f).    Exempt beneficial owner.  An exempt beneficial owner means a person that is described in Regulations section 1.1471-6 and includes a foreign government, a political subdivision of a foreign government, a wholly owned instrumentality or agency of a foreign government or governments, an international organization, a wholly owned agency or instrumentality of an international organization, a foreign central bank of issue, a government of a U.S. possession, certain retirement funds, and certain entities wholly owned by one or more exempt beneficial owners. In addition, an exempt beneficial owner includes any person treated as an exempt beneficial owner under an applicable Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA.    Financial institution.  A financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(e).    Foreign central bank of issue.  A foreign central bank of issue is a bank that is by law or government sanction the principal authority, other than the government itself, to issue instruments intended to circulate as currency. Such a bank is generally the custodian of the banking reserves of the country under whose law it is organized. The Bank of International Settlements is treated as though it were a foreign central bank of issue. A foreign central bank of issue must provide Form W-8EXP to establish eligibility for exemption from withholding for payments exempt from tax under either section 892 or section 895.    Foreign financial institution (FFI).  A foreign financial institution (FFI) generally means a foreign entity that is a financial institution.    Foreign person.  A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, foreign estate, foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign person.    Foreign government.  For chapter 3 purposes, a foreign government includes only the integral parts or controlled entities of a foreign sovereign as defined in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-2T. Similar definitions apply for chapter 4 purposes under Regulations section 1.1471-6(b). An integral part of a foreign sovereign, in general, is any person, body of persons, organization, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of a foreign country. The net earnings of the governing authority must be credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion benefiting any private person. A controlled entity of a foreign sovereign is an entity that is separate in form from the foreign sovereign or otherwise constitutes a separate juridical entity only if:   It is wholly owned and controlled by the foreign sovereign directly or indirectly through one or more controlled entities. It is organized under the laws of the foreign sovereign by which it is owned. Its net earnings are credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion of its income benefiting any private person. Its assets vest in the foreign sovereign upon dissolution.    A controlled entity of a foreign sovereign also includes a pension trust defined in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-2T(c) and may include a foreign central bank of issue to the extent that it is wholly owned by a foreign sovereign. A foreign government must provide Form W-8EXP to establish eligibility for exemption from withholding for payments exempt from tax under section 892 or for purposes of establishing its status as an exempt beneficial owner.    Intergovernmental agreement (IGA).  An IGA means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, see the list of jurisdictions at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx. A Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency thereof, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI. A Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the U.S. or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency thereof and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that has entered into an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is a participating FFI, but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI.    International organization.  For purposes of chapter 3, an international organization is any public international organization entitled to enjoy privileges, exemptions, and immunities as an international organization under the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288-288(f)). In general, to qualify as an international organization, the United States must participate in the organization pursuant to a treaty or under the authority of an Act of Congress authorizing such participation. Any organization that qualifies as an international organization under chapter 3 also qualifies as an international organization under chapter 4.  For purposes of chapter 4, an international organization also includes any intergovernmental or supranational organization that is comprised primarily of foreign governments, that is recognized as an intergovernmental or supranational organization under a foreign law similar to 22 U.S.C. 288-288(f) or that has in effect a headquarters agreement with a foreign government, and whose income does not inure to the benefit of private persons.    Participating FFI.  A participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term participating FFI also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution, unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI.    Specified U.S. person.  A specified U.S. person is any U.S. person other than a person identified in Regulations section 1.1473-1(c).    Substantial U.S. owner.

Territory financial institution.  The term territory financial institution means a financial institution that is incorporated or organized under the laws of any U.S. territory. However, an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company is not a territory financial institution.    Withholdable payment.  The term withholdable payment means an amount subject to withholding for purposes of chapter 4 as described in Amounts subject to withholding, earlier. Also see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a) for the definition of withholdable payment.    Withholding agent.  Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or 4 withholding is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies.      Specific Instructions    Part I — Identification of Beneficial Owner Before completing Part I, complete the Worksheet for Foreign Governments, International Organizations, and Foreign Central Banks of Issue, later, to determine whether amounts received are or will be exempt from U.S. tax under section 892 or 895 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Use the results of this worksheet to check the appropriate box on line 3 and in Part II. Do not give the worksheet to the withholding agent. Instead, keep it for your records.  Line 1.  Enter the full name of the organization.    Line 2.  Enter the country under the laws of which the foreign government or other foreign organization was created, incorporated, organized, or governed.    Line 3.  Check the one box that applies. A foreign central bank of issue (wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) should check the \"Foreign government\" box. If you are a Foreign private foundation, you should check the \"Foreign private foundation\" box rather than the \"Foreign tax-exempt organization\" box.     Line 4.  Check the one box that applies to your chapter 4 status (if necessary). You are required to provide a chapter 4 status if you are the payee of a withholdable payment or hold an account with an FFI requesting this form. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(a) for the definition of a payee for purposes of chapter 4. By checking a box on this line, you are representing that you qualify for this classification and, if you are claiming a status as an exempt beneficial owner, that you are the beneficial owner of the payments to which this form relates for purposes of chapter 4.      For certain chapter 4 statuses, you are required to complete an additional line on this form certifying that you meet the conditions of the status indicated on line 4 (as defined under Regulations section 1.1471-5 or 1.1471-6 or an applicable IGA). Make sure you complete the required portion of this form before signing and providing it to the withholding agent.    If you do not certify as to your chapter 4 status, this Form W-8EXP will not be valid for purposes of chapter 4 if you receive a withholdable payment at any time in the future. For example, if you do not certify as to your chapter 4 status because the only payments you receive from the withholding agent are with respect to grandfathered obligations described in Regulations section 1.1471-2(b), then you will be required to resubmit Form W-8EXP and certify to your chapter 4 status if you receive a withholdable payment in the future. You may consider certifying to your chapter 4 status even if not required in order to avoid resubmitting Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent. See Expiration of Form W-8EXP, earlier.  Line 5.  The permanent address of a foreign government, international organization, or foreign central bank of issue is where it maintains its principal office. For all other organizations, the permanent address is the address in the country where the organization claims to be a resident for tax purposes. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless such address is the only permanent address you use and it appears as your registered address in your organizational documents.    Line 6.  Enter the mailing address only if it is different from the address shown on line 5.    Line 7.  A U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN) means an employer identification number (EIN). A U.S. TIN is generally required if you are claiming an exemption or reduced rate of withholding based solely on your claim of tax-exempt status under section 501(c) or private foundation status. Use Form SS-4, to obtain an EIN.    Line 8a.  If the organization has registered with the IRS as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), direct reporting NFFE, check the \"GIIN\" box and provide your GIIN. For payments made prior to January 1, 2015, a Form W-8EXP provided by a reporting Model 1 FFI need not contain a GIIN. For payments made prior to January 1, 2016, a sponsored direct reporting NFFE may provide the GIIN of its sponsoring entity.    Line 8b.  If you are providing this Form W-8EXP to document yourself as an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on a Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the TIN issued to you by the jurisdiction in which you are a tax resident identified on line 5 unless:  You have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs), or You properly identified yourself as a foreign government, foreign central bank of issue, international organization, or government of a U.S. possession on line 3.  If you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 8b, and you are not a foreign government, foreign central bank of issue, international organization, or government of a U.S. possession, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. The explanation may be written on line 8b, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If you are writing the explanation on line 8b, you may shorten it to \"not legally required.\" Do not write \"not applicable.\"                 Line 9.  This line may be used by the filer of Form W-8EXP or by the withholding agent to whom it is provided to include any referencing information that is necessary or useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its obligations. For example, a filer may use line 9 to include the name and number of the account for which the filer is providing the form.       Part II — Qualification Statement for Chapter 3 Status    You are not required to complete a chapter 3 qualification statement if you are submitting this form to document your chapter 4 status and are not receiving a payment that is subject to withholding under chapter 3. However, in such a case, you may also provide Form W-8BEN-E to document your chapter 4 status.  Line 10.  All foreign governments claiming the applicability of section 892 must check box 10a as well as box 10b or box 10c, whichever applies. Enter the name of the foreign sovereign’s country on line 10b (if the entity is an integral part of a foreign government) or on line 10c (if the entity is a controlled entity). A central bank of issue (wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) should check box 10c.    Line 11.  Check this box if you are an international organization. By checking this box, you are certifying to all the statements made in line 11.    Line 12.  Check this box if you are a foreign central bank of issue for purposes of chapter 3 (see definitions) not wholly owned by a foreign sovereign. By checking this box, you are certifying to all the statements made in line 12.    Line 13.  If you are a foreign tax-exempt organization, you must attach a statement setting forth any income that is includible under section 512 in computing your unrelated business taxable income.    Box 13a. Check this box if you have been issued a determination letter by the IRS. Enter the date of the IRS determination letter.     Box 13b.

       " '   Instructions for Form W-8IMY (06/2017)  Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 06/2017       General Instructions    Future developments. For the latest information about developments related to Form W-8IMY and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to www.irs.gov/Formw8imy.     What’s New  Qualified derivatives dealers (QDDs). This form and these instructions have been updated to reflect final and temporary regulations published in January 2017 as well as the Qualified Intermediary Agreement published in Rev. Proc. 2017-15, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB/ar15.html, with respect to the requirements of a QDD. A QDD that receives payments for which the QDD is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty may use its Form W-8IMY to both certify its status as a qualified intermediary (QI) acting as a QDD and to claim treaty benefits with respect to such payments. To make a claim for treaty benefits in such a case, the QDD should provide a withholding agent with a statement associated with its Form W-8IMY that contains the information required in Part III of Form W-8BEN-E.   U.S. branch certification. Final regulations under chapter 4 published in January 2017 changed certain requirements for U.S. branches of foreign entities. This form has been updated to include the certification required of U.S. branches of foreign financial institutions (FFIs) that are not treated as U.S. persons. For payments made on or after July 1, 2017, those branches must certify that they are applying the rules described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) in order to avoid being withheld upon under chapter 4. The final regulations also provide that U.S. branches of FFIs that are treated as U.S. persons no longer have to be branches of FFIs with specified chapter 4 statuses. These instructions reflect that change by allowing such branches to leave lines 5 and 9 blank.   Limited FFIs and limited branches. Limited FFI and limited branch statuses expired on December 31, 2016, and have been removed from the form and instructions.   Sponsored FFIs and sponsored direct reporting non-financial foreign entities (sponsored direct reporting NFFEs). As of January 1, 2017, a sponsored FFI that is a registered deemed-compliant FFI or sponsored direct reporting NFFE is required to obtain its own GIIN to be provided on this form and can no longer provide its sponsoring entity’s GIIN. This form has been updated to reflect this requirement.   Nonreporting IGA FFIs. This form and these instructions have been updated to reflect the requirements for withholding agents to document nonreporting IGA FFIs in the Treasury regulations. These instructions also clarify that nonreporting IGA FFIs that are sponsored entities should provide their own GIIN (if required) and should not provide the GIIN of the sponsoring entity. See the instructions to Part XIX. In addition, these instructions provide that a trustee of a trustee-documented trust that is a foreign person should provide the GIIN it received when it registered as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or reporting Model 1 FFI.    \\xa0 Purpose of Form Under chapter 3, foreign persons are generally subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of interest (including certain original issue discount (OID)), dividends, rents, premiums, annuities, compensation for, or in expectation of, services performed, or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) gains, profits, or income. This tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441 or 1442 on that amount. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person, such as an intermediary, agent, trustee, executor, or partnership, for the benefit of the beneficial owner. Under chapter 4, withholding agents must withhold at a 30% rate under sections 1471 and 1472 on withholdable payments made to nonparticipating FFIs (including when the nonparticipating FFI is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary), certain other foreign entities, and certain account holders of FFIs. For example, if a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment of portfolio interest described in section 871(h) to an account maintained by a nonparticipating FFI, the payment will be subject to a 30% withholding tax under section 1471 even if the nonparticipating FFI is an intermediary or flow-through entity and the beneficial owner for whom the intermediary or flow-through is acting is a foreign individual who provides a valid Form W-8BEN. Foreign persons are also subject to tax at graduated rates on income they earn that is considered effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person invests in a partnership that conducts a U.S. trade or business, the foreign person is considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The partnership is required to withhold tax under section 1446 on the foreign person’s distributive share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. The partnership may generally accept any form submitted for purposes of section 1441 or 1442, with few exceptions, to establish the foreign status of the partner. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6 to determine whether the form submitted for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will be accepted for purposes of section 1446.   \\xa0 For purposes of section 1446, Form W-8IMY may only be submitted by an upper-tier foreign partnership or a foreign grantor trust, both of which must furnish additional documentation for their owners.  Additional information. For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.    \\xa0 Who Must Provide Form W-8IMY Except as otherwise provided, you should provide Form W-8IMY when receiving a reportable amount or withholdable payment on behalf of another person or as a flow-through entity. When receiving a withholdable payment, your chapter 4 status is generally required to be included on the form unless otherwise provided in accordance with these instructions. Form W-8IMY must be provided by the following persons.    A foreign person, or a foreign branch of a U.S. person, to establish that it is a QI that is not acting for its own account, to represent that it has provided or will provide a withholding statement, as required, or, if applicable, to represent that it has assumed primary withholding responsibility under chapters 3 and 4 of the Code (excluding section 1446) and/or primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility.   A foreign person, or a foreign branch of a U.S. person, to establish that it is a QI acting as a QDD or assuming primary withholding responsibility with respect to payments of substitute interest, as permitted by the QI agreement. A foreign person should also provide a Form W-8IMY to establish that it is a qualified intermediary that has a foreign branch that is acting as a QDD. A QDD that receives payments for which the QDD is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty may use its Form W-8IMY to both certify to its status as a QI acting as a QDD and to claim treaty benefits with respect to such payments.   A foreign person to establish that it is a nonqualified intermediary that is not acting for its own account, to certify its chapter 4 status (if required), to certify whether it reports U.S. accounts under chapter 4 (if required), and to indicate, if applicable, that it is using the form to transmit withholding certificates and/or other documentary evidence and has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required.   A U.S. branch that is acting as an intermediary to represent that the income it receives is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and either that it is using the form (1) to evidence it is treated as a U.S. person under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) with respect to any payments associated with the Form W-8IMY, or (2) to transmit the documentation of the persons for whom it receives a payment and has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required, and to certify it is applying the rules described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) when receiving a withholdable payment.   A financial institution incorporated or organized under the laws of a U.S. territory that is acting as an intermediary or is a flow-through entity to represent that it is a financial institution (other than an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company) and either that it is using the form (1) to evidence it is treated as a U.S. person under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) with respect to any payments associated with the Form W-8IMY, or (2) to certify that it is transmitting documentation of the persons for whom it receives a payment and has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required.   A foreign partnership or a foreign simple or grantor trust to establish that it is a withholding foreign partnership or withholding foreign trust.   A foreign partnership or a foreign simple or grantor trust to establish that it is a nonwithholding foreign partnership or nonwithholding foreign simple or grantor trust to certify to its chapter 4 status (if required), to represent that the income is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and to certify that the form is being used to transmit withholding certificates and/or documentary evidence and that it has provided or will provide a withholding statement as required.   A foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust to establish that it is an upper-tier foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust for purposes of section 1446 and to represent that the form is being used to transmit withholding certificates and/or documentary evidence and that it has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required.   A flow-through entity (including a foreign reverse hybrid entity) transmitting withholding certificates and/or other documentary evidence to claim treaty benefits on behalf of its owners, to certify its chapter 4 status (if required), and to certify that it has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement, as required.   A nonparticipating FFI acting as an intermediary or that is a flow-through entity using this form to transmit a withholding statement and withholding certificates or other documentation for exempt beneficial owners described in Regulations section 1.1471-6.   Prior to January 1, 2018, a qualified securities lender (QSL) certifying to a withholding agent that it is acting as a QSL with respect to U.S. source substitute dividends received from the withholding agent pursuant to a securities lending transaction (as described in Notice 2010-46).   A foreign intermediary or flow-through entity not receiving withholdable payments or reportable amounts that is holding an account with a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI providing this form for purposes of documenting its chapter 4 status as an account holder. No withholding statement is required to be provided along with Form W-8IMY in this case. The entity may instead provide Form W-8BEN-E to document its chapter 4 status as an account holder of an FFI when it is not receiving withholdable payments or reportable amounts.    \\xa0 This form may serve to establish foreign status for purposes of sections 1441, 1442, and 1446. However, any representations that items of income, gain, deduction, or loss are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business will be disregarded by a partnership receiving this form for purposes of section 1446 as the partnership will undertake its own analysis. Do not use Form W-8IMY if you are described below.    You are the beneficial owner (other than a QDD acting in its QDD capacity) of U.S. source income (other than income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States), and you need to establish that you are not a U.S. person, establish your chapter 4 status (if required), or claim a reduced rate of withholding on your own behalf under an income tax treaty (if applicable). Instead, submit Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E.   You are a hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits on your own behalf (unless you are a QDD acting in your QDD capacity). Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E to claim treaty benefits. However, if you are receiving a withholdable payment you may also be required to provide Form W-8IMY to establish your chapter 4 status (unless you are a disregarded entity) and the chapter 4 status of each of your partners, beneficiaries, or owners. See the instructions for Form W-8BEN-E for more information about hybrid entities claiming treaty benefits.   You are a foreign reverse hybrid entity (unless you are a QDD acting in your QDD capacity) that is not claiming treaty benefits on behalf of your interest holders. Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E on your own behalf.   You are the beneficial owner of income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI.   You are a nonresident alien individual who claims exemption from withholding on compensation for independent or certain dependent personal services performed in the United States. Instead, provide Form 8233 or Form W-4.   You are a disregarded entity, other than a hybrid entity that is a disregarded entity claiming treaty benefits on your own behalf (see above bullet). Instead, the single owner (if a foreign person) should provide the appropriate Form W-8 based on the single owner\\'s status. If you are a disregarded entity that is a QDD acting in your QDD capacity, your single owner (whether or not a QDD) should provide Form W-8IMY if it is a QI.   You are a QI that has QDD status but are receiving payments of U.S. source income that you beneficially own that are not payments in respect to potential section 871(m) transactions or underlying securities (that is, you are receiving payments that you beneficially own that are not covered by your QI agreement). Instead, provide the appropriate Form W-8 based on your status for those payments you beneficially own.   You are a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b), and, if required, claiming an exemption from chapter 4 withholding. Instead, provide Form W-8EXP. However, these entities should use Form W-8BEN-E instead if they are claiming treaty benefits or are providing the form only to claim exempt recipient status for Form 1099 and backup withholding purposes.    \\xa0  Giving Form W-8IMY to the withholding agent. Do not send Form W-8IMY to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, the person who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. If you are an account holder of an FFI, the FFI may request this form from you to document the status of your account for chapter 4 purposes.   \\xa0 You may provide a single Form W-8IMY if you have multiple branches receiving payments from the same withholding agent rather than separate Forms W-8IMY to identify each branch receiving payments associated with the form. In such a case, you should provide a schedule that includes all required information for each branch. See the instructions for Part II.  When to provide Form W-8IMY to the withholding agent. Give Form W-8IMY to the person requesting it before income is paid, credited, or allocated to your account. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold at the 30% rate (for an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3 or a withholdable payment under chapter 4), backup withhold, or withhold at the applicable rate for net effectively connected taxable income allocable to a foreign partner in a partnership under section 1446. Generally, a separate Form W-8IMY must be submitted to each withholding agent from whom you receive a payment.    Expiration of Form W-8IMY. Generally, a Form W-8IMY remains valid until the status of the person whose name is on the certificate is changed in a way relevant to the certificate or there is a change in circumstances that makes the information on the certificate no longer correct. The indefinite validity period does not extend, however, to any other withholding certificates, documentary evidence, or withholding statements associated with the certificate. If you are a QDD, the attachment associated with your Form W-8IMY used to claim treaty benefits (if applicable) is treated as a beneficial owner withholding certificate that is not valid indefinitely.   Change in circumstances. If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8IMY (or any documentation or withholding statement associated with the Form W-8IMY) you have submitted incorrect for purposes of chapter 3 or chapter 4 (when relevant), you must notify the withholding agent within 30 days of the change in circumstances and provide the documentation required in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E)(2). You must update the information associated with Form W-8IMY as often as is necessary to enable the withholding agent to withhold at the appropriate rate on each payment and to report such income.  See Regulations sections 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for the definition of a change in circumstances for purposes of chapter 3 and Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E) for the definition of a change in circumstances for purposes of chapter 4.    \\xa0 With respect to an FFI claiming a chapter 4 status under an applicable IGA, a change in circumstances includes when the jurisdiction where the FFI is organized or resident (or the jurisdiction where a disregarded entity or branch of an FFI is organized, identified in Part II of the form) was included on the list of jurisdictions treated as having an intergovernmental agreement in effect and is removed from that list or when the FATCA status of the jurisdiction changes (for example, from Model 2 to Model 1). The list of agreements is maintained at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx.  \\xa0 Definitions  Account. With respect to QI, including a QI acting as a QDD, an account is defined in section 2.01 of the QI Agreement.   Account holder. An account holder is generally the person listed or identified as the holder or owner of a financial account (other than an agent or nominee that is not an FFI). For example, if a partnership is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, then the partnership is the account holder rather than the partners of the partnership. However, an account that is held by a disregarded entity is treated as held by the person owning the entity. With respect to a QI acting as a QDD, see section 2.02 of the QI Agreement for the definition of account holder.   Amounts subject to withholding. Generally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. Amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding do not include amounts that are not FDAP, such as most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID). Amounts subject to chapter 4 withholding are payments of U.S. source FDAP income that are withholdable payments as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a) and to which no exception under Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) applies (for example, certain nonfinancial payments are excepted from the definition of withholdable payment). The exemptions from withholding provided for under chapter 3 are not applicable when determining whether withholding applies under chapter 4.  For purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income.    Beneficial owner. For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income.  Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not itself a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself.  The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself.  Note. A payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee that is not subject to 30% withholding for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. For purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust or disregarded entity shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9 in its own right. Rather, the grantor or other owner shall provide the withholding agent the appropriate form.   \\xa0   Chapter 3. Chapter 3 means chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.   Chapter 3 withholding rate pool. A chapter 3 withholding rate pool is a payment of a single type of income, based on the categories of income reported on Form 1042-S (for example, interest or dividends), that is not subject to withholding under chapter 4 but is subject to a single rate of withholding for chapter 3 purposes and is paid to foreign persons or, in the case of a zero-percent pool, U.S. exempt recipients not included in a separate pool of exempt recipients.    Chapter 4. Chapter 4 means chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.   Chapter 4 status. The term chapter 4 status means a person’s status as a U.S. person, specified U.S. person, foreign individual, participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, restricted distributor, exempt beneficial owner, nonparticipating FFI, territory financial institution, excepted NFFE, or passive NFFE.   Chapter 4 withholding rate pool. The term chapter 4 withholding rate pool means a pool identified on a withholding statement provided by an intermediary or flow-through entity with respect to a withholdable payment that is allocated to payees that are nonparticipating FFIs. The term chapter 4 withholding rate pool also includes a pool identified on an FFI withholding statement provided by a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI with respect to a withholdable payment that is allocated to a class of recalcitrant account holders as described in Regulations section 1.1471- 4(d)(6) (or with respect to an FFI that is a QI, a single pool of recalcitrant account holders without the need to subdivide into each class of recalcitrant account holder), including a pool of account holders to which the escrow procedures for dormant accounts apply. Finally, a chapter 4 withholding rate pool also includes a pool of U.S. persons included in a U.S. payee pool described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4) provided by a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), or a QI.   Deemed-compliant FFI. Under section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a GIIN. These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1) and also an applicable IGA for entities treated as registered deemed-compliant FFIs.   Disregarded entity. A business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. A disregarded entity does not submit Form W-8IMY to a withholding agent or FFI. Instead, the owner of such entity provides the appropriate documentation (for example, a Form W-8BEN-E if the owner is a foreign entity that is not a QDD). However, if a disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment is an FFI outside the single owner’s country of organization or has its own GIIN, see the instructions to Part II of Form W-8IMY for when to provide the chapter 4 status of the disregarded entity receiving the payment. Certain entities that are disregarded for U.S. tax purposes may nevertheless be treated as treaty residents for purposes of claiming treaty benefits under an applicable tax treaty (see the definition of hybrid entity, later). See Form W-8BEN-E and the accompanying instructions for more information about a hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf as a resident of a treaty jurisdiction.   Financial account. A financial account includes:     A depository account maintained by an FFI;    A custodial account maintained by an FFI;    Equity or debt interests (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market) in investment entities and certain holding companies, treasury centers, or financial institutions;   Certain cash value insurance contracts; and   Annuity contracts.    \\xa0 For purposes of chapter 4, exceptions are provided for accounts such as certain tax-favored savings accounts, term life insurance contracts, accounts held by estates, escrow accounts, and certain annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)(2). Accounts may also be excluded from the definition of financial account under an applicable IGA.   Financial institution. A financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(e).   Fiscally transparent entity. An entity is treated as fiscally transparent with respect to an item of income to the extent that the interest holders in the entity must, on a current basis, take into account separately their shares of an item of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed, and must determine the character of the items of income as if they were realized directly from the sources from which realized by the entity. For example, partnerships, common trust funds, and simple trusts or grantor trusts are generally considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to items of income received by them.   Flow-through entity. A flow-through entity is a foreign partnership (other than a withholding foreign partnership), a foreign simple or foreign grantor trust (other than a withholding foreign trust), or, for payments for which a reduced rate of withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, any entity to the extent the entity is considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to the payment by an interest holder’s jurisdiction.   Foreign financial institution (FFI). A foreign financial institution (FFI) generally means a foreign entity that is a financial institution.   Foreign person. A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign person.    Global intermediary identification number (GIIN). A GIIN is the identification number assigned to an entity that has registered with the IRS for chapter 4 purposes.    Hybrid entity. A hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is treated as fiscally transparent (rather than as a beneficial owner) under the Code but is not treated as fiscally transparent by a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. Hybrid entity status is relevant for claiming treaty benefits for purposes of chapter 3. A hybrid entity, may, however, be considered the payee for purposes of chapter 4 (see Regulations section 1.1471-3(a) defining who is a payee of a withholdable payment). See the special instructions for hybrid entities, later, and Regulations section 1.1471-3(d) for the documentation requirements with respect to entities receiving withholdable payments.   Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). An IGA means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, go to www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx.  A Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency thereof, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI. A Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency thereof and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that registered with the IRS to obtain a GIIN and agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is treated as a participating FFI but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI.  The term reporting IGA FFI refers to both reporting Model 1 FFIs and reporting Model 2 FFIs.   Intermediary. An intermediary is any person that acts as a custodian, broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for another person, regardless of whether that other person is the beneficial owner of the amount paid, a flow-through entity, or another intermediary.   \\xa0 Qualified intermediary (QI). A QI is a person that is a party to a withholding agreement with the IRS (described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii)) and is:     A foreign financial institution (other than a U.S. branch of an FFI) that is a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including an FFI treated as a deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA subject to due diligence and reporting requirements similar to those applicable to a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1), including the requirement to register with the IRS), or any other category of FFI identified in the QI agreement;   A foreign person that is a home office or has a branch that is an eligible entity (as described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6)(ii), without regard to the requirement that the person be a qualified intermediary);   A foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or a foreign branch or office of a U.S. clearing organization; or    A foreign entity not described above that the IRS accepts as a qualified intermediary.    \\xa0   \\xa0 Qualified derivatives dealer (QDD). A QDD is a qualified intermediary that is an eligible entity that agrees to meet the requirements of Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6)(i) and the QI agreement. An eligible entity is defined in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6)(ii). To act as a QDD, the home office or branch, as applicable, must qualify and be approved for QDD status and must represent itself as a QDD on its Form W-8IMY and separately identify the home office or branch as a recipient on a withholding statement (if required). Each home office or branch that obtains QDD status is treated as a separate QDD.   \\xa0 Qualified securities lender (QSL). Notice 2010-46, available at IRS.gov/irb/2010-24_IRB/ar09.html, provided rules for QSLs acting with respect to payments of substitute dividends. A QSL should certify to its QSL status in Part III of this form, even if it is not a qualified intermediary. An entity will no longer be able to claim QSL status as of January 1, 2018.   \\xa0 Nonqualified intermediary. A nonqualified intermediary is any intermediary that is not a U.S. person and that is not a qualified intermediary.     Nonreporting IGA FFI. A nonreporting IGA FFI is an FFI that is a resident of, or located or established in, a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that meets the requirements of:    A nonreporting financial institution described in a specific category in Annex II of the Model 1 or Model 2 IGA;   A registered deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(A) through (F);   A certified deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(2)(i) through (v); or   An exempt beneficial owner described in Regulations section 1.1471-6.    \\xa0   Nonwithholding foreign partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust. A nonwithholding foreign partnership is any foreign partnership other than a withholding foreign partnership. A nonwithholding foreign simple trust is any foreign simple trust that is not a withholding foreign trust. A nonwithholding foreign grantor trust is any foreign grantor trust that is not a withholding foreign trust.   Participating FFI. A participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term participating FFI also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution, unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI.   Payee. A payee is generally a person to whom a payment is made, regardless of whether such person is the beneficial owner. For a payment made to a financial account, the payee is generally the holder of the financial account. However, under certain circumstances a person who receives a payment will not be considered the payee. For purposes of chapter 3, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2) and for chapter 4, see Regulations section 1.1471-3(a)(3).   Reportable amount. Solely for purposes of the statements required to be attached to Form W-8IMY, a reportable amount is an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3, U.S. source deposit interest (including original issue discount), and U.S. source interest or original issue discount on the redemption of short-term obligations. It does not include payments on deposits with banks and other financial institutions that remain on deposit for 2 weeks or less or amounts received from the sale or exchange (other than a redemption) of a short-term obligation that is effected outside the United States. It also does not include amounts of original issue discount arising from a sale and repurchase transaction completed within a period of 2 weeks or less, or amounts described in Regulations section 1.6049-5(b)(7), (10), or (11) (relating to certain obligations issued in bearer form).    Reverse hybrid entity. A reverse hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is not fiscally transparent under U.S. tax law principles but that is fiscally transparent under the laws of a jurisdiction with which the United States has an income tax treaty.    Territory financial institution. The term territory financial institution means a financial institution that is incorporated or organized under the laws of any U.S. territory. However, an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company is not a territory financial institution. A territory financial institution acting as an intermediary or that is a flow-through entity may agree to be treated as a U.S. person under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A).    Withholdable payment. The term withholdable payment is defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a).    Withholding agent. Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or a withholdable payment under chapter 4 is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies. For purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent may be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.    Withholding foreign partnership (WP) or withholding foreign trust (WT). A WP or WT is a foreign partnership or a foreign simple or grantor trust that has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS in which it agrees to assume primary withholding responsibility for purposes of chapter 4 and under sections 1441 and 1442 for all payments that are made to its partners, beneficiaries, or owners, except as otherwise provided in the withholding agreement. A WP also includes a foreign reverse hybrid entity that has entered into a withholding agreement.   Withholding statement. A withholding statement provides an allocation (by income type) to each payee (or withholding rate pool, if applicable, or other pool of payees to the extent permitted under the chapter 3 or 4 regulations) of each payment an intermediary or flow-through entity receives. The withholding statement forms an integral part of the withholding certificate, and the penalties of perjury statement provided on the withholding certificate shall apply to the withholding statement. The withholding statement may be provided in any manner upon which the intermediary or the flow-through entity and the withholding agent mutually agree, including electronically if certain safeguards concerning electronic transmission are met. A withholding statement also provides information required for purposes of chapter 4 if the intermediary or flow-through entity is receiving a withholdable payment, in which case the entity must provide an FFI withholding statement, chapter 4 withholding statement, or exempt beneficial owner withholding statement (as applicable). See Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B). Additional information is required for a withholding statement from a QDD.       Specific Instructions    \\xa0 Part I — Identification of Entity  Line 1. Enter your name. By doing so, you are representing to the payer or withholding agent that you are not the beneficial owner of the amounts that will be paid to you (unless you are acting as a QDD or QSL for certain payments associated with this form or you are a QI acting with respect to payments of substitute interest, as permitted by the QI agreement). If you are a disregarded entity, do not enter the business name of the disregarded entity here. Instead, enter the legal name of the entity that owns the disregarded entity (looking through multiple disregarded entities, if applicable).   Line 2. If you are a corporation, enter the country of incorporation. If you are another type of entity, enter the country under whose laws you are created, organized, or governed.    Line 3. If you are a disregarded entity receiving a payment, enter your name (if required). You are required to complete line 3 if you are a disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment or hold an account with an FFI requesting this form and you:     Have registered with the IRS and been assigned a GIIN associated with the legal name of the disregarded entity; and   Are a reporting Model 1 FFI or reporting Model 2 FFI .    \\xa0  \\xa0 If you are not required to provide the legal name of the disregarded entity, however, you may want to notify the withholding agent that you are a disregarded entity receiving a payment or maintaining an account by indicating the name of the disregarded entity on line 10.    Line 4. Complete this line to establish your entity status for purposes of chapter 3. Check the one box that applies. If you are a foreign partnership receiving the payment on behalf of your partners, check the \"Withholding foreign partnership\" box or the \"Nonwithholding foreign partnership\" box, whichever is appropriate. If you are a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust receiving the payment on behalf of your beneficiaries or owners, check the \"Withholding foreign trust\" box, the \"Nonwithholding foreign simple trust\" box, or the \"Nonwithholding foreign grantor trust\" box, whichever is appropriate. If you are a foreign partnership (or a foreign trust) receiving a payment on behalf of persons other than your partners (or beneficiaries or owners), check the \"Qualified intermediary\" box or the \"Nonqualified intermediary\" box, whichever is appropriate. A foreign reverse hybrid entity that is providing documentation from its interest holders to claim a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty should check the appropriate box (including \"Withholding foreign partnership\" or \"Withholding foreign trust\" if the entity has entered into a withholding agreement). A partnership or grantor trust submitting Form W-8IMY solely because it is allocated income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business as a partner in a partnership should check the box for nonwithholding foreign partnership or nonwithholding foreign grantor trust and, if it is submitting or will submit documentation for its partners or owners, it should complete Part VIII.  \\xa0 Form W-8IMY may be provided to satisfy documentation requirements for purposes of withholding on certain partnership allocations to foreign partners under section 1446. Section 1446 generally requires withholding when a partnership is conducting a trade or business in the United States and allocates income effectively connected with that trade or business (ECI) to foreign persons that are partners in the partnership. Section 1446 can also apply when certain income is treated as effectively connected income of the partnership and is so allocated.   \\xa0 An upper-tier partnership that is allocated ECI as a partner in a partnership may, in certain circumstances, have the lower-tier partnership perform its withholding obligation. Generally, this is accomplished by the upper-tier partnership submitting withholding certificates of its partners (for example, Form W-8BEN) along with a Form W-8IMY, which identifies itself as a partnership, and identifying the manner in which ECI of the upper-tier partnership will be allocated to the partners. For further information, see Regulations section 1.1446-5. A foreign grantor trust that is allocated ECI as a partner in a partnership should provide the withholding certificates of its grantor (for example, Form W-8BEN) along with its Form W-8IMY which identifies the trust as a foreign grantor trust. See Regulations section 1.1446-1(c)(2)(ii)(E) for the rules requiring it to provide additional documentation to the partnership.    Line 5. Check the one box that applies to your chapter 4 status. You are only required to provide a chapter 4 status if you are acting as an intermediary with respect to a withholdable payment, you are a flow-through entity receiving a withholdable payment on behalf of your owners (including a reverse hybrid entity providing documentation on behalf of its owners to claim treaty benefits), you are providing a withholding statement associated with this form that allocates a portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees with respect to your direct account holders (as described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)), you are providing this form to an FFI requesting this form to document your chapter 4 status, or you are a QI (including a QDD), WP, or WT. If you are a U.S. branch that does not agree to be treated as a U.S. person and that does not make the certification on line 19c, you should check nonparticipating FFI; otherwise, leave line 5 blank. By checking a box on this line, you are representing that you qualify for this classification.  \\xa0 For most of the chapter 4 classifications, you are required to complete additional certifications found in Parts IX through XXVIII. Complete the appropriate part of this form certifying that you meet the conditions of the status indicated on line 5 (as defined under Regulations sections 1.1471-5 or 1.1471-6). Complete the required portion of this form before signing and providing it to the withholding agent.   \\xa0 FFIs Covered by IGAs and Related Entities A reporting FFI resident in, or established under the laws of, a jurisdiction covered by a Model 1 IGA should check \"Reporting Model 1 FFI.\" A reporting FFI resident in, or established under the laws of, a jurisdiction covered by a Model 2 IGA should check \"Reporting Model 2 FFI.\" If you are treated as a registered deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA, you should check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI\" rather than \"registered deemed-compliant FFI\" and provide your GIIN. See the specific instructions for Part XIX. In general, if you are treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI under an applicable IGA, you should check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI\" even if you meet the qualifications for deemed-compliant status under the chapter 4 regulations. In such a case, you need not also check your applicable status under the regulations but should provide your GIIN on line 9. However, an owner documented FFI that is treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI under an applicable IGA must check \"Owner-documented FFI\" and complete Part XI. An FFI that is related to a reporting IGA FFI and that is treated as a nonparticipating FFI in its country of residence should check nonparticipating FFI in line 5. An FFI that is related to a reporting IGA FFI and that is a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or exempt beneficial owner under the U.S. Treasury regulations or an applicable IGA should check the appropriate box depending on its chapter 4 status rather than the box for nonparticipating FFI. If you are an FFI in a jurisdiction treated as having an IGA in effect, you should not check \"Participating FFI\" and should check \"Reporting Model 1 FFI\" or \"Reporting Model 2 FFI\" as applicable. See www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx for a list of jurisdictions treated as having an IGA in effect.   Line 6. Enter the permanent address of the entity identified on line 1. Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for purposes of that country\\'s income tax. Do not show the address of a financial institution (other than yourself), a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless such address is the only permanent address you use and it appears in your organizational documents (that is, your registered address). If you do not have a tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is where you maintain your principal office.    Line 7. Enter your mailing address only if it is different from the address you show on line 6.    Line 8. You must provide an employer identification number (EIN) if you are a U.S. branch or territory financial institution, an upper-tier partnership that is allocated ECI as a partner in a partnership, or a foreign grantor trust that is allocated ECI as a partner.  If you are acting as a qualified intermediary (including a QDD), withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust, check the appropriate box and enter the EIN that was issued to you in such capacity (your \"QI-EIN,\" \"WP-EIN,\" or \"WT-EIN\"). If you are not acting in that capacity, you must use your U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN), if any, that is not your QI-EIN, WP-EIN, or WT-EIN.  A nonqualified intermediary, a nonwithholding foreign partnership, or a nonwithholding foreign simple or grantor trust is generally not required to provide a U.S. TIN. However, a QSL providing this form with respect to a U.S. source substitute dividend must provide an EIN (including a QI-EIN if the QSL is a QI).   Line 9. If you are a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI and a sponsored FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(F)), direct reporting NFFE (including a sponsored direct reporting NFFE), or trustee of a trustee documented trust that is a foreign person, you are required to enter your GIIN (with regard to your country of residence) on line 9. If you are a trustee of a trustee-documented trust and you are a foreign person, you should provide the GIIN that you received when you registered as a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI. In addition, you must provide your GIIN on line 9 if you are a nonreporting IGA FFI that is (1) treated as registered deemed-compliant under Annex II to an applicable Model 2 IGA or (2) a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1). If you are a QI acting as a QDD, you must provide your GIIN on line 9 if you have one. If you are a certified deemed-compliant FFI described in Part XIV of this form, provide the GIIN of your sponsoring entity on line 9.   \\xa0 If you are in the process of registering with the IRS as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a sponsored FFI), reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, direct reporting NFFE, sponsored direct reporting NFFE, or nonreporting IGA FFI but have not received a GIIN, you may complete this line by writing \"applied for.\" However, the person requesting this form from you must receive and verify your GIIN within 90 days. If you are a disregarded entity that completed Part I, line 3, do not enter your GIIN on line 9. Instead, enter it on line 13.  Line 10. You, or a withholding agent, may use this line to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its reporting and withholding obligations. For example, a withholding agent who is required to associate a particular Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E with this Form W-8IMY may use line 10 for a referencing number or code that will make the association clear.     \\xa0 Part II — Disregarded Entity or Branch Receiving Payment Complete Part II for a disregarded entity that has its own GIIN and is receiving a withholdable payment or for a branch (including a branch that is a disregarded entity that does not have its own GIIN) operating in a jurisdiction other than the country of residence identified in line 2. For example, assume ABC Co., which is a participating FFI resident in Country A, operates through a branch in Country B (which is a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction) and the branch is treated as a reporting Model 1 FFI under the terms of the Country B Model 1 IGA. ABC Co. should not enter its GIIN on line 9, and the Country B branch should complete this Part II by identifying itself as a reporting Model 1 FFI and providing its GIIN on line 13. If the Country B branch receiving the payment is a disregarded entity, you may be required to provide its legal name on line 3.  \\xa0 If the disregarded entity receiving a withholdable payment has its own GIIN, Part II should be completed regardless of whether it is in the same country as the single owner identified in Part I. If you have multiple branches/disregarded entities receiving payments from the same withholding agent and the information in Part I is the same for each branch/disregarded entity that will receive payments, you may provide (and a withholding agent may accept) a single Form W-8IMY with a separate schedule attached that includes all of the Part II information for each branch/disregarded entity rather than separate Forms W-8IMY to identify each branch receiving payments associated with the form. You must also provide the withholding agent with sufficient information to associate the payments with each branch/disregarded entity. If you are a QDD home office or you are a QI and have one or more QDD branches, do not complete Part II for any branches that are acting in their QDD capacities. Instead, provide the relevant branch information that you would otherwise provide on Part II (including the information required for chapter 4 purposes, as required) on your withholding statement.  Line 11. Check the one box that applies. If no box applies to the disregarded entity, you do not need to complete Part II. If you check reporting Model 1 FFI, reporting Model 2 FFI, or participating FFI, you must complete line 13. If you are a branch of a reporting IGA FFI that cannot comply with the requirements of an applicable IGA or the regulations under chapter 4, you must check branch treated as nonparticipating FFI. If you are a QI that is an NFFE and a withholding agent requests your chapter 4 status, you may provide a statement certifying to your chapter 4 status as an NFFE.   Line 12. Enter the address of the branch or disregarded entity.    Line 13. If you are a reporting Model 1 FFI, a reporting Model 2 FFI, or a participating FFI, you must enter on line 13 the GIIN of your branch that receives the payment. If you are a disregarded entity that completed Part I, line 3 of this form and are receiving payments associated with this form, enter your GIIN. Do not enter your GIIN (if any) on line 9. If you are a U.S. branch, do not enter a GIIN on line 13.   \\xa0 If you are in the process of registering your branch with the IRS but have not received a GIIN, you may complete this line by writing “applied for.” However, the person requesting this form from you must receive and verify your GIIN within 90 days.    \\xa0 Certification of Chapter 3 Status: Parts III Through VIII You should only complete one part from Parts III through VIII. Generally, if you are acting in multiple capacities, you should provide separate Forms W-8IMY for each capacity. For example, if you are acting as a qualified intermediary for one account, but a nonqualified intermediary for another account, you should provide one Form W-8IMY in your capacity as a qualified intermediary and a separate Form W-8IMY in your capacity as a nonqualified intermediary. You may, however, provide a single Form W-8IMY that covers more than one category of QI provided that you properly identify the accounts and/or transactions, as required, on a withholding statement. For example, if you are a QI that acts as both a QI and a QDD, you may provide a single Form W-8IMY with a withholding statement designating each type of account or transaction.   \\xa0 Part III — Qualified Intermediary Check box 14 if you are a qualified intermediary (QI) (whether or not you assume primary withholding responsibility) for the payments for which you are providing this form. By checking the box, you are certifying to the applicable statements contained on line 14. See the QI agreement for the definition of \"account\" for purposes of Part III. Complete line 15 only if you are acting as a QI that is not a QDD. To the extent you are a QI acting as a QDD, see the instructions for line 16. Check box 15a if you have assumed primary withholding responsibility under both chapter 3 and chapter 4 with respect to the account(s). This box may be checked regardless of which boxes you check for boxes 15b through 15f for any accounts identified on a withholding statement. Check box 15b if you have assumed primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility with respect to the accounts identified in a withholding statement associated with this form or if you are a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that meets the requirements to report only under Regulations sections 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii). For accounts for which you check this box 15b, you should not check boxes 15c through 15f.  \\xa0 If you checked boxes 15a and 15b with respect to any accounts, you do not have to provide a withholding statement for payments made to those accounts. Check box 15c if you have not assumed primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility. If you check box 15c, check the applicable certification(s) in 15d or 15e. If you are allocating any portion of the payment on a withholding statement to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees in lieu of providing Forms W-9, you must certify by checking boxes 15d and/or 15e (as applicable):    For each account holder included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees who holds an account that you maintain, you are permitted to provide this pool under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) (including for payments of income other than interest for which reporting would be required under chapter 61 but for a coordination rule similar to that provided in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii)); and/or   For a withholding rate pool of U.S. payees that includes account holders of another intermediary or flow-through entity, you have obtained or will obtain documentation to establish that the intermediary or flow-through entity is a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or a qualified intermediary. See Regulations sections 1.1471-3(d)(4) and 1.1471-3(e) for more information on the requirements for documenting such chapter 4 statuses.    \\xa0  \\xa0 A payment that is subject to chapter 3 withholding or that should be subject to chapter 4 withholding may not be included in a U.S. payee pool that is described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(ii). Although, as a QI, you obtain withholding certificates or appropriate documentation from beneficial owners or payees, as specified in your QI agreement, you do not need to attach the certificates or documentation to this form. However, to the extent you have not assumed primary Form 1099 reporting or backup withholding responsibility and are not permitted to allocate the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii), you must disclose the names of those U.S. persons for whom you receive reportable amounts and that are not exempt recipients (as defined in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) or under section 6041, 6042, 6045, or 6050N). You should make this disclosure by attaching to Form W-8IMY the Forms W-9 (or substitute forms) of persons that are U.S. non-exempt recipients. If you do not have a Form W-9 for a non-exempt U.S. payee, you must attach to Form W-8IMY any information you do have regarding that person’s name, address, and TIN for a withholding agent to report the payment. Check box 15f to certify that you are a QI that is acting as a QSL with respect to all payments associated with this form that are U.S. source substitute dividends made by a party to a securities lending transaction (as described in Notice 2010-46) for payments made before January 1, 2018. Check line 15g to certify that you are a QI that is assuming primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 and primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility with respect to all payments associated with this form that are U.S. source interest and substitute interest payments, as permitted by (and described in) the QI agreement. You may act as a QI with respect to such substitute interest payments under the QI agreement regardless of whether you are acting in a principal or intermediary capacity with respect to payments of interest and substitute interest you receive that are associated with this form.  Line 16a. Check the box in line 16a to certify that each QDD identified on the form or on the withholding statement that is acting as a QDD meets the requirements to act as a QDD in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(6) and assumes primary withholding and reporting responsibilities under chapters 3, 4, and 61, and section 3406 with respect to potential section 871(m) transactions.   \\xa0 A QI that is acting as a QDD should provide this Form W-8IMY only for payments in respect of potential section 871(m) transactions and underlying securities. To certify your foreign status for any other payment of U.S. source income you beneficially own, see Who Must Provide Form W-8IMY, earlier.  Line 16b. Check the box to indicate your status, including if you are a QDD that is a disregarded entity claiming treaty benefits. If the QDD is a branch other than a disregarded entity (that is, a branch that is not a separate legal entity from its home office), check the box to indicate the status of the entity identified in Part I.   Claim of treaty benefits. If you are acting as a QDD, you may be entitled to claim treaty benefits for certain payments that are subject to withholding that you receive in your principal capacity (for example, interest payments or payments of dividends beginning in 2018). To make a claim for treaty benefits in such a case, you may provide your withholding agent a statement associated with your Form W-8IMY that contains the information required in Part III of Form W-8BEN-E, including (if applicable) a treaty claim by a hybrid entity that is a disregarded entity that is identified on a QDD\\'s withholding statement described in the instructions to Part II. Alternatively, a Form W-8BEN-E may be used for this purpose.   \\xa0 If you are acting as a QDD and fiscally transparent in your jurisdiction of organization, do not claim treaty benefits as described in these instructions. Instead, you must include the withholding certificates or documentary evidence of the owners claiming treaty benefits and provide an allocation on the withholding statement.  QDD branch of a U.S. person. If you are a foreign branch of a U.S. person that is acting as a QDD and you receive a payment that otherwise would be subject to withholding except for the U.S. person’s status as a U.S. person, you may associate this Form W-8IMY with a Form W-9 from the U.S. person.   Withholding statement of a QI. As a QI, you must provide a withholding statement to each withholding agent from which you receive reportable amounts or withholdable payments if you have not assumed primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 with respect to the payment and, if you are receiving a reportable amount on behalf of a U.S. non-exempt recipient, you have not assumed primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility for the payment. The withholding statement becomes an integral part of the Form W-8IMY and, therefore, the certification statement that you sign in Part XXIX of the form applies to the withholding statement as well as to the form.  A QI withholding statement must:    Designate those accounts for which you act as a QI,   Designate those accounts for which you are assuming primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 of the Code,   If applicable, designate those accounts or payments for which you are acting as a QSL with respect to any U.S. source substitute dividends, and   Provide information to allocate the payment, as applicable, to chapter 3 withholding rate pools, chapter 4 withholding rate pools, or other pools of payees permitted under the chapter 4 regulations. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2).    \\xa0  \\xa0 For chapter 4 purposes. If you are a QI and you receive a withholdable payment, you must provide a withholding statement which satisfies the requirements of an FFI withholding statement or chapter 4 withholding statement (if you are not an FFI) when you do not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 and Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility for the payment. If you are a QI that is an FFI you may provide an FFI withholding statement to allocate the payment to chapter 4 withholding rate pools (as applicable) or other pool of payees permitted on an FFI withholding statement under the chapter 4 regulations. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2). You may also provide on the withholding statement a single pool of nonparticipating FFIs, a single pool of recalcitrant account holders of yours or of or another intermediary that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, and, if you do not assume primary Form 1099 and backup withholding responsibility, a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. A chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees may include:    If you are a reporting Model 1 FFI, an account holder that is not withheld on under chapter 3, chapter 4, or section 3406 that you report as a U.S. account pursuant to the Model 1 IGA because the account has U.S. indicia and you have not obtained appropriate documentation to treat the account as held by other than a specified U.S. person;   If you are a reporting Model 2 FFI, an account holder that is not withheld on under chapter 3, chapter 4, or section 3406 that you report as an account holder of a non-consenting U.S. account as described in the Model 2 IGA;   If you are a non-U.S. payor (as described in Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(5)) that is a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI, or reporting Model 1 FFI, an account holder not withheld on under chapter 4 or section 3406 who you report under chapter 4 or an applicable IGA (including the account holder’s TIN).    \\xa0 An FFI withholding statement must also identify each intermediary or flow-through entity that is receiving a payment on behalf of a payee and include such entity’s chapter 4 status and GIIN (if applicable), excluding any intermediary or flow-through entity that is an account holder or interest holder in another QI, WP, or WT. An FFI withholding statement of a QI may combine withholding rate pool information provided by such an entity to the QI with withholding rate pools comprised of accounts that the QI maintains. If you are a QI that is not an FFI and that does not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4, you must provide, for a withholdable payment, a chapter 4 withholding statement that contains the name, address, TIN (if any), entity type (if applicable), and chapter 4 status of each payee, the amount allocated to each payee, a valid withholding certificate or other documentation sufficient to establish the payee’s chapter 4 status. However, a chapter 4 withholding statement may include pooled information for payees that are nonparticipating FFIs that hold accounts that you maintain or hold accounts with an intermediary or flow-through entity receiving the payment from you. You may also provide another pool of payees as permitted under the chapter 4 regulations for a chapter 4 withholding statement. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B).   \\xa0 For chapter 3 purposes. In the case of a reportable amount that is a withholdable payment, any portion of the payment for which you are acting as a QI that is not allocated to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool or a U.S. non-exempt recipient (including for backup withholding purposes) must be allocated to a chapter 3 withholding rate pool or pool of U.S. exempt recipients, if it is not required to be separately reported. The chapter 3 withholding rate pool may be established by any reasonable method agreed upon by you and the withholding agent. For example, you may agree to establish a separate account for a single chapter 3 withholding rate pool or you may agree to divide a payment made to a single account into portions allocable to each chapter 3 withholding rate pool. You must provide the chapter 3 withholding rate pool information that is required for the withholding agent to meet its withholding and reporting obligations. A withholding agent may request any information reasonably necessary to withhold and report payments correctly.   \\xa0 Form 1099 reporting. If you do not assume primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility, you must provide payee specific information for each U.S. non-exempt recipient account holder (other than those U.S. payees included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii)) or when the alternative procedure is used. The pools are based on valid documentation that you obtain or, if a payment cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation, the applicable presumption rules.  Example 1. A QI that is a participating FFI receives a $100 payment of U.S. source dividends on an account for which it acts as a QI held with the withholding agent for the following recipients:    $20 to NPFFI, a nonparticipating FFI that is an account holder of the QI;   $10 each on behalf of two recalcitrant account holders of the QI ($20 total), each with U.S. indicia (as described in Regulations section 1.1441-7(b)(5)) associated with the account;   $5 each on behalf of A and B, U.S. individual account holders of the QI that the QI reports as U.S. accounts pursuant to its chapter 4 reporting obligations as a participating FFI ($10 total);   $10 on behalf of C, a U.S. exempt recipient that is not a specified U.S. person and is an indirect account holder of the QI (who beneficially owns the payment through an account with another participating FFI);   $20 on behalf of D, a U.S. non-exempt recipient that is a specified U.S. person who is an indirect account holder of the QI (that beneficially owns the payment through an account with a certified deemed-compliant FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(2)); and   $10 each on behalf of two nonresident alien individuals who are account holders of the QI, one of whom is entitled to a 15% rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty.    \\xa0 The dividend payment is both a withholdable payment under chapter 4 and a reportable amount under chapter 3. The QI assumes primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 as well as primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility. As a result, the QI is not required to provide a withholding statement allocating the payment to specific payees or withholding rate pools. The QI will provide Form W-8IMY and check boxes 14, 15a, and 15b.  \\xa0  Example 2. The facts are the same as Example 1, except QI is a non-U.S. payor under Regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(5) and does not assume primary Form 1099 and backup withholding responsibility but reports the accounts of A and B as U.S. accounts under Regulations section 1.1471-4(d). The QI must provide a withholding statement allocating $20 of the payment to D, $10 to C, and $10 to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. The QI need not allocate any portion of the payment specifically to A or B because the QI is a non-U.S. payor that is permitted to include A and B in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i). For payments made on or after April 1, 2017, see the instructions to Part IV of this form for when a withholding statement includes an allocation of a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding that is made to a pool of U.S. payees. The QI must also provide a Form W-9 (or alternatively, name and TIN) for D. A Form W-9 is not required for C. The QI will provide Form W-8IMY and check boxes 14, 15a, and 15d.  \\xa0  Example 3. The facts are the same as Example 1, except the QI is a U.S. payor and does not assume primary Form 1099 and backup withholding responsibility. Because the QI is a U.S. payor, it is not permitted, under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i) and (iii), to include A and B in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. The QI must provide a withholding statement allocating $5 of the payment to A, $5 of the payment to B, $10 of the payment to C, and $20 of the payment to D along with Forms W-9 (or name and TIN) for A, B, and D. The QI will provide Form W-8IMY and check boxes 14 and 15a.  \\xa0  Example 4. The facts are the same as Example 1, except the QI is a non-U.S. payor that does not assume primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4. The QI also does not assume primary Form 1099 and backup withholding responsibility. If the QI does not assume primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 as well as primary Form 1099 reporting and separate backup withholding responsibilities, the QI will provide an FFI withholding statement with the following pools:    Nonparticipating FFI Pool — $20 (which is subject to chapter 4 withholding);   Recalcitrant Account Holder Pool — $20 (which is subject to chapter 4 withholding and which is aggregated in a single pool of recalcitrant account holders rather than each class described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(6));   Chapter 4 Withholding Rate Pool of U.S. Payees — $10 (for the portion of the payment allocable to A and B);   Chapter 3 30% Rate Pool — $10;   Chapter 3 15% Rate Pool — $10; and   0% Rate Pool — $10 (for the portion of the payment allocable to C).    \\xa0 The QI will also be required to allocate $20 to a separate withholding rate pool for D because D is a U.S. non-exempt recipient who cannot be included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (because D’s account is maintained by a certified deemed-compliant FFI). The QI will provide Form W-8IMY and check boxes 14, 15c, and 15d.  \\xa0   \\xa0 Alternative procedure for U.S. non-exempt recipients. If approved by the withholding agent, you can establish:    A single pool (not subject to backup withholding) for all U.S. non-exempt recipient account holders for whom you have provided Forms W-9 or are includible in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees prior to the withholding agent making any payments. Alternatively, you may include such U.S. non-exempt recipients in a zero rate withholding pool that includes U.S. exempt recipients and foreign persons exempt from non-resident alien withholding provided all the conditions of the alternative procedure are met; and   A separate pool for all U.S. non-exempt recipient account holders subject to backup withholding for whom you have not provided Forms W-9 prior to the withholding agent making any payments.    \\xa0 If you elect the alternative procedure, you must provide the allocation information required by your QI withholding agreement to the withholding agent no later than January 15 of the year following the year in which the payments are paid. Failure to provide this information may result in penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 and termination of your withholding agreement with the IRS.  \\xa0 The amount allocable to these two pools under the alternative procedure excludes amounts allocated to the chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees.   Updating the statement. Your withholding statement must be updated as often as is necessary to allow the withholding agent to withhold at the appropriate rate on each payment and to correctly report the income to the IRS. The updated information becomes an integral part of Form W-8IMY.    QDD withholding statement. In addition to the information required on a withholding statement (if any) you provide in your QI capacity, a QDD withholding statement should (as applicable) for each QDD:    Designate the accounts for which the QDD is receiving dividend equivalent or dividend payments with respect to potential section 871(m) transactions or underlying securities (as defined in Regulations section 1.871-15(a)(15)), respectfully, as a QDD;   Designate the accounts for which the QDD is receiving dividend equivalents with respect to potential section 871(m) transactions as a QDD (and that are not underlying securities) for which withholding is not required;    Designate the accounts for which the QDD is receiving payments with respect to underlying securities for which withholding is required as a QDD; and   Identify the home office or branch that is treated as the owner for U.S. income tax purposes.    \\xa0 If you are acting as a QDD that meets the conditions described below, you must provide on your QDD withholding statement your taxpayer identification number (TIN) issued by the jurisdiction in which you are tax resident identified on line 6, unless you were not issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs). If you do not provide your TIN, you must provide on your QDD withholding statement an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. Do not write “not applicable.” If you are acting as a QDD, you are required to provide your TIN or an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN if:    You are providing this Form W-8IMY to document yourself as an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI);    You receive U.S. source income reportable on a Form 1042-S associated with this form; and   This form is treated as a beneficial owner withholding certificate under Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i).    \\xa0    \\xa0 Part IV — Nonqualified Intermediary If you are providing Form W-8IMY as a nonqualified intermediary (NQI), you must check box 17a. By checking this box, you are certifying to all of the statements on line 17a.  \\xa0 If you are required to provide a chapter 4 status on line 5 and are acting as an intermediary for a withholdable payment, you must provide your chapter 4 status on line 5 or as otherwise permitted in these instructions to avoid withholding at the chapter 4 rate of 30% being applied to any withholdable payment you receive from the withholding agent regardless of whether you check box 17b (except for documentation provided with respect to exempt beneficial owners). Check box 17b if you are using this form to transmit withholding certificates or other documentation along with a withholding statement that satisfies the requirements of chapters 3 and 4 (including if you are providing pooled information for purposes of chapter 61 under the alternative procedure for U.S. non-exempt recipients, or chapter 4 withholding rate pools (as applicable) for a withholdable payment). Check box 17c to certify that you are permitted under Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4) to provide a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees to which a payment is allocated on a withholding statement associated with the Form W-8IMY. Check box 17d to certify that you are acting as a QSL with respect to the accounts identified on this line or in a withholding statement associated with this form with respect to a payment that is a U.S. source substitute dividend. If you are acting on behalf of another NQI or on behalf of a foreign partnership or foreign trust that is not a withholding foreign partnership or a withholding foreign trust, you must attach to your Form W-8IMY the Form W-8IMY of the other NQI, foreign partnership, or foreign trust together with the withholding certificates and other documentation attached to that Form W-8IMY that are required for both chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes.  Withholding statement of an NQI. If you are an NQI, you must provide a withholding statement and appropriate documentation to obtain reduced rates of withholding for your customers under chapter 3 and chapter 61 and to avoid certain reporting responsibilities. However, see the paragraph later describing an NQI’s withholding statement for chapter 4 purposes for when an NQI may provide a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees without such documentation. The withholding statement must be provided prior to a payment and becomes an integral part of the Form W-8IMY and, therefore, the certification statement that you sign in Part XXIX of the form applies to the withholding statement as well as to the form.   \\xa0 For chapter 4 purposes. If you are an NQI that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI and you receive a withholdable payment, you must provide a withholding statement which satisfies the requirements of an FFI withholding statement or chapter 4 withholding statement.  An FFI withholding statement may allocate the payment to chapter 4 reporting rate pools (as appropriate), including a chapter 4 withholding rate pool for nonparticipating FFIs, recalcitrant account holders (in each class of account holders described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(6)(i)), or other pool of payees permitted on an FFI withholding statement under the chapter 3 or 4 regulations (see Regulations sections 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B) and 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)), and, for a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), U.S. payees. However, if you are an NQI, you may allocate a portion of a reportable amount (regardless of whether the payment is a withholdable payment) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees when you satisfy the requirements to provide such a pool (including the requirement to certify to your status as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI)). The withholding statement must also identify each intermediary or flow-through entity that is receiving a payment (excluding any intermediary or flow-through entity that is an account holder or interest holder in a QI, WP, or WT), each such entity’s chapter 4 status and GIIN (if applicable), and the chapter 4 withholding rate pools associated with each such entity receiving the payment.  A chapter 4 withholding statement must contain the name, address, TIN (if any), entity type, chapter 4 status of each payee, the amount allocated to each payee, and a valid withholding certificate or other documentation sufficient to establish each payee’s chapter 4 status. However, a chapter 4 withholding statement may instead include pooled information for payees that are nonparticipating FFIs or another pool of payees as permitted under the chapter 4 regulations for a chapter 4 withholding statement. The withholding statement must also identify each intermediary or flow-through entity that is receiving a payment (excluding any intermediary or flow-through entity that is an account holder or interest holder in a QI, WP, or WT), each such entity’s chapter 4 status and GIIN (if applicable), and the chapter 4 withholding rate pools associated with each such entity receiving the payment.    \\xa0 A payment that is subject to chapter 3 withholding or that should be subject to chapter 4 withholding should not be included in a U.S. payee pool that is described in Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(ii). For payments made on or after April 1, 2017, an allocation of a payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding to a withholding rate pool of U.S. payees must identify the payees as described in Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2).  \\xa0 For chapter 3 and chapter 61 purposes. For chapter 3 and chapter 61 purposes, in the case of a reportable amount that is also a withholdable payment, the withholding statement should allocate only the portion of the payment that was not allocated to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool or a pool described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C) or to a payee identified on the withholding statement to whom withholding was applied under chapter 4. The withholding statement generally must include the following information.    Include the name, address, U.S. TIN (if any), chapter 4 status (for a foreign person receiving a withholdable payment), and the type of documentation (documentary evidence, Form W-9, or type of Form W-8) for every person for whom documentation has been received and state whether that person is a U.S. exempt recipient, a U.S. non-exempt recipient, or a foreign person. The statement must indicate whether a foreign person is a beneficial owner or an intermediary, flow-through entity, U.S. branch, or territory financial institution and the type of recipient, based on the recipient codes shown on Form 1042-S.   Allocate each payment by income type to every payee for whom documentation has been provided. The type of income is based on the income codes reported on Form 1042-S (or, if applicable, the income categories for Form 1099). If a payee receives income through another NQI, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch acting as an intermediary, the withholding certificate must also state the name, address, U.S. TIN (if known), and, for a withholdable payment, the chapter 4 status (if required) and GIIN (if applicable) of the other NQI or U.S. branch from which the payee directly receives the payment or the flow-through entity in which the payee has a direct ownership interest. If another NQI, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch fails to allocate a payment, you must provide, for that payment, the name of the NQI, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch that failed to allocate the payment.   If a payee is identified as a foreign person, specify the rate of withholding under chapter 3 to which the payee is subject, the payee’s country of residence and, if a reduced rate of withholding is claimed, the basis for that reduced rate (for example, treaty benefit, portfolio interest, or exemption under section 501(c)(3), 892, or 895). The statement must also include the U.S. or foreign TIN (if required) and, if the beneficial owner is not an individual and is claiming treaty benefits, state whether the limitation on benefits and section 894 statements have been provided by the beneficial owner. You must inform the withholding agent as to which payments those statements relate.   Include any other information the withholding agent requests in order to fulfill its withholding and reporting obligations under chapters 3 and 4 of the Code and/or Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility.     \\xa0   \\xa0 Alternative procedure for NQIs. To use the alternative procedure you must inform the withholding agent on your withholding statement that you are using the procedure, and the withholding agent must agree to the procedure. Under this procedure, you must provide a withholding agent with all the information required on the withholding statement and all payee documentation, except the specific allocation information for each payee, prior to the payment of a reportable amount. In addition, you must provide the withholding agent with withholding rate pool information. The withholding statement must assign each payee that is not subject to withholding under chapter 4 to a chapter 3 withholding rate pool prior to the payment of a reportable amount. The withholding rate pool may be established by any reasonable method agreed upon by you and the withholding agent. For example, you may agree to establish a separate account for a single withholding rate pool, or you may agree to divide a payment made to a single account into portions allocable to each withholding rate pool. You must determine withholding rate pools based on valid documentation or, to the extent a payment cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation, the applicable presumption rules.  You must provide the withholding agent with sufficient information to allocate the income in each withholding rate pool to each payee (including U.S. exempt recipients) within the pool no later than January 31 of the year following the year of payment. If you fail to provide allocation information, if required, by January 31 for any withholding rate pool, you may not use this procedure for any payment made after that date for all withholding rate pools. You may remedy your failure to provide allocation information by providing the information to the withholding agent no later than February 14.  In the case of a reportable amount that is also a withholdable payment, you may include amounts allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool (other than a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees) and payees subject to chapter 4 withholding for whom you will provide payee specific information in a 30-percent rate pool together with payees subject to chapter 3 withholding at the 30-percent rate and may not otherwise apply these provisions for payments made to U.S. non-exempt recipients (regardless of whether the payment is a withholdable payment). For the amount of the payment allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees, you may include such an amount in the withholding rate pool that is exempt from withholding (you can include such payees in an exempt pool regardless of whether the payment is a withholdable payment). You must identify prior to the payment each chapter 4 withholding rate pool to be allocated a portion of the payment and must also allocate by January 31 the portion of the payment to each such pool in addition to allocating the payment to each other payee as described in the preceding paragraph. See Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(D) for further information on alternative procedures for an NQI.   \\xa0 Alternative withholding statement. If a withholding agent agrees, instead of providing a withholding statement that contains all of the information described previously, you may provide an alternative withholding statement. You may only use an alternative withholding statement if you are providing the withholding agent with withholding certificates (and not documentary evidence) from the beneficial owners of the payment. The alternative withholding statement is not required to include information that is already on the withholding certificates (including name, address, TIN, chapter 4 status, and GIIN), and you are not required to provide the rate of withholding applicable to each beneficial owner, so long as the withholding agent can determine the appropriate rate based on the withholding certificates. Just as for a nonqualified intermediary withholding statement, the alternative withholding statement must provide information for allocating the payment to each payee and must include any other information the withholding agent needs to fulfill its withholding and reporting obligations. You must also provide a representation on the alternative withholding statement that the information on the withholding certificates is not inconsistent with any other account information you have for the beneficial owner applicable to determining the appropriate rate of withholding. See Regulations section 1.1441-1T(e)(3)(iv)(C)(3).     \\xa0 Part V — Territory Financial Institution  \\xa0 Line 18 Check box 18a to certify that you are a financial institution (other than an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company) incorporated or organized under the laws of a possession of the United States. You must also check either box 18b or 18c. Check box 18b to certify that you have agreed to be treated as a U.S. person for purposes of both chapter 3 and chapter 4 with respect to payments associated with this Form W-8IMY. In this case, you will be responsible for chapter 3 withholding and reporting, backup withholding under section 3406, and chapter 4 withholding and reporting for any payments you make to persons for whom you are receiving a reportable amount or withholdable payment. If you check this box 18b, you must provide an EIN on line 8. Check box 18c to certify that you are a territory financial institution that has not agreed to be treated as a U.S. person. You must certify that you are transmitting withholding certificates or other documentation for persons for whom you are receiving a payment (as required for chapter 3, chapter 61, and section 3406 purposes, and, in the case of a withholdable payment, for chapter 4 withholding and reporting purposes). You must also certify that you have provided or will provide a withholding statement (as required) with the information required on an NQI withholding statement.  \\xa0 A territory entity that is a flow-through entity but is not a territory FI may not complete this Part V and agree to be treated as a U.S. person. Instead, complete Part IV or Part VIII, as appropriate.    \\xa0 Part VI — Certain U.S. Branches  \\xa0 Line 19 Check box 19a to certify that you are a U.S. branch described in Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) receiving income that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. You must also check either box 19b or 19c. Check box 19b to certify that you are a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or insurance company described in this certification that has agreed with the withholding agent to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to payments associated with this Form W-8IMY. In such case, you will be responsible for chapter 3 withholding and reporting, backup withholding under section 3406, chapter 4 withholding and reporting for any payments you make to persons for whom you are receiving a withholdable payment (including any of your branches treated as NPFFIs), and will be treated as a U.S. payor for chapter 61 purposes. You must provide your EIN on line 8. You do not need to provide a chapter 4 status on line 5 or a GIIN on line 9. Check box 19c to certify that you are a U.S. branch that does not have an agreement with the withholding agent to be treated as a U.S. person. You must certify that you are transmitting withholding certificates or other documentation for persons for whom you are receiving the payment. You must also certify that you have provided or will provide a withholding statement (as required) with the information required on an NQI withholding statement. For payments made on or after July 1, 2017, also check box 19c to certify that, when you are receiving a withholdable payment associated with this form, you are applying the rules described in Regulations section 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C). You must also provide your EIN on line 8 but do not need to include a chapter 4 status in Part I, line 5 or a GIIN on line 9. If you are unable to make this certification, you cannot fill out this part but instead must check the box on line 5 indicating you are a nonparticipating FFI.    \\xa0 Part VII — Withholding Foreign Partnership (WP) or Withholding Foreign Trust (WT) Check box 20 if you are a WP or a WT and you are receiving the payment on behalf of your partners, beneficiaries, or owners. If you are acting as a WP or WT, you must assume primary withholding and reporting responsibility under chapter 3 and chapter 4 for all payments that are made to you for your partners, beneficiaries, or owners. Therefore, you are not required to provide information to the withholding agent regarding each partner’s, beneficiary’s, or owner’s distributive share of the payment and the information for the withholding agent to report under section 1472 (if otherwise required). If you are also receiving payments from the same withholding agent for persons other than your partners, beneficiaries, or owners, you must provide a separate Form W-8IMY for those payments. If you are receiving a withholdable payment, you must provide your chapter 4 status in line 5 and provide your GIIN (if applicable).   \\xa0 Part VIII — Nonwithholding Foreign Partnership, Simple Trust, or Grantor Trust Check box 21a if you are a foreign partnership or a foreign simple or grantor trust that is not a WP or WT. Check box 21b if you are a foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust providing this form for purposes of section 1446. If you are a foreign partnership or grantor trust receiving payments of reportable amounts and providing this form for purposes of section 1446, you may check both boxes. By checking either box, you are certifying to the applicable statements on the form.  Note. If you are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-8ECI (instead of Form W-8IMY). If you are not receiving the income on behalf of your partners, beneficiaries, or owners, do not complete Part VIII. If you are a hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits, provide Form W-8BEN-E. However, if you are receiving a withholdable payment you may also be required to provide this Form W-8IMY and provide your chapter 4 status and the chapter 4 status of each of your owners. See the instructions for Form W-8BEN-E for more information about hybrid entities claiming treaty benefits. If you are receiving a withholdable payment, you must provide a chapter 4 status in line 5 and provide your GIIN (if applicable) and the information required for the withholding agent to report under section 1472.  \\xa0  Withholding statement of nonwithholding foreign partnership or nonwithholding foreign trust. You must provide the withholding agent with a withholding statement to obtain reduced rates of withholding and relief from certain reporting obligations. The withholding statement must provide the same information as required for an NQI withholding statement, including the information required with respect to an NQI, foreign partnership, or foreign trust (other than a WP or WT) for which you receive a payment. The withholding statement becomes an integral part of the Form W-8IMY. If you are an FFI and allocate any portion of the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees with respect to accounts that you maintain, you must meet the requirements of Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) and certify to your status in Part I, line 5 as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or reporting Model 2 FFI. By providing a withholding statement making such an allocation with this form, you certify that you meet the requirements outlined for an NQI withholding statement described earlier.    Foreign partnerships and trusts providing Form W-8IMY for purposes of section 1446. In general, a partnership is required to withhold under section 1446 on effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) allocable to a foreign partner. A foreign upper-tier partnership (UTP) that is a partner in a lower-tier partnership (LTP) should provide the LTP with a Form W-8IMY and documentation sufficient for the LTP to determine the status of the indirect partner to whom the ECTI is allocable (looking through additional foreign UTPs, if applicable) and to determine such partner’s share of the lower-tier partnership’s ECTI. A foreign grantor trust that is a partner in a partnership should provide Form W-8IMY to the partnership along with documentation and information concerning the grantor or other owner sufficient for the partnership to reliably associate the portion of the trust’s allocable share of ECTI with the grantor or other owner. Check line 21b to certify that you are a foreign partnership or grantor trust providing this Form W-8IMY to a lower-tier partnership for purposes of section 1446.  \\xa0 If you are providing this Form W-8IMY solely for purposes of section 1446, you generally are not required to provide a chapter 4 status because items of effectively connected income are not withholdable payments. However, if you do not provide a chapter 4 status and subsequently receive a withholdable payment, you will also be required to provide a Form W-8IMY to provide your chapter 4 status or the lower-tier partnership may have to withhold on the payment. You may provide your chapter 4 status on this form even if you are not required to do so.    \\xa0 Certification of Chapter 4 Status: Parts IX Through XXVIII You should complete only one part certifying to your chapter 4 status (if required). Identify which part (if any) you should complete by reference to the box you checked on line 5.   \\xa0 Part IX — Nonparticipating FFI With Exempt Beneficial Owners  \\xa0 You are not required to complete this part unless you are a nonparticipating FFI providing documentation on behalf of an exempt beneficial owner. Check box 22 to certify that you are transmitting withholding certificates or other documentation for exempt beneficial owners for chapter 4 purposes on whose behalf you are receiving a payment that is a withholdable payment. See Regulations section 1.1471-6. You must also certify that you have provided or will provide a withholding statement (as required) allocating a portion of the payment to the exempt beneficial owners as required under Regulations section 1.1471-3(d)(8)(ii). The withholding statement must include the name, address, TIN (if any), entity type, and chapter 4 status of each exempt beneficial owner on behalf of which you are receiving the payment, the amount of the payment allocable to each exempt beneficial owner, a valid withholding certificate or other documentation sufficient to establish the chapter 4 status of each exempt beneficial owner under the requirements of chapter 4, and any other information the withholding agent reasonably requests in order to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4. Additionally, the withholding statement must provide all information required for purposes of chapter 3 with respect to each exempt beneficial owner if the payment is an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding. The withholding statement must allocate the remainder of the payment that is not allocated to an exempt beneficial owner to you.   \\xa0 Part X — Sponsored FFI If you are a sponsored FFI described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(F), on line 23a, enter the name of the sponsoring entity that has agreed to fulfill your chapter 4 due diligence, reporting, and withholding obligations on your behalf. You must provide your GIIN on line 9. You must check the applicable box in line 23b or 23c to certify that you are either an investment entity or controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957(a)) and satisfy the other relevant requirements for this classification.   \\xa0 Part XI — Owner-Documented FFI  \\xa0 An owner-documented FFI should only complete Form W-8IMY if it is a flow-through entity receiving income allocable to its partners, owners, or beneficiaries. An owner-documented FFI is not permitted to act as an intermediary with respect to a withholdable payment. You must check box 24a to certify that you satisfy the requirements for owner-documented FFI status and are providing this form to a U.S. financial institution, a participating FFI, or a reporting Model 1 FFI that has agreed to act as a designated withholding agent with respect to you (see Regulations section 1.1471-5(f)(3)). You must also check either box 24b or 24c. Check box 24b to certify that you have provided or will provide the documentation set forth in the certifications, including the owner reporting statement described in this line 24b. Check box 24c to certify that you have provided or will provide an auditor’s letter (in lieu of the information required by line 24(b)) that satisfies the requirements described in this line.   \\xa0 Part XII — Certified Deemed-Compliant Nonregistering Local Bank You must check box 25 to certify that you satisfy all of the requirements for certified deemed-compliant nonregistering local bank status.   \\xa0 Part XIII — Certified Deemed-Compliant FFI with Only Low-Value Accounts You must check box 26 to certify that you satisfy all of the requirements for certified deemed-compliant FFI with only low-value account status.   \\xa0 Part XIV — Certified Deemed-Compliant Sponsored, Closely Held Investment Vehicle On line 27a, enter the name of the sponsoring entity that has agreed to fulfill your chapter 4 due diligence, reporting, and withholding obligations on your behalf. You must also enter the GIIN of your sponsoring entity on line 9. You must check box 27b to certify that you satisfy the requirements for certified deemed-compliant classification as a sponsored closely held investment vehicle.   \\xa0 Part XV — Certified Deemed-Compliant Limited Life Debt Investment Entity You must check box 28 to certify that you satisfy the requirements for certified deemed-compliant limited life debt investment entity status.   \\xa0 Part XVI — Certain Investment Entities that Do Not Maintain Financial Accounts You must check box 29 to certify that you meet all of the requirements for certified deemed-compliant status as an investment entity that does not maintain financial accounts.   \\xa0 Part XVII — Restricted Distributor You must check box 30a to certify that you satisfy the requirements of restricted distributor status. You must also check either box 30b or 30c, as appropriate, to certify that your distribution agreement meets the requirements of this classification.   \\xa0 Part XVIII — Foreign Central Bank of Issue You must check box 31 to certify that you are a foreign central bank of issue acting as an intermediary and are an entity defined in Regulations section 1.1471-6 that is treated as the beneficial owner of the payment for chapter 4 purposes (applying the rule in Regulations section 1.1471-6(d)(4)). You cannot be treated as an intermediary for purposes of this Part XVIII if you are receiving the payment in connection with a commercial activity described in Regulations section 1.1471-6(h)(1) or are not receiving payments subject to chapter 3 withholding.   \\xa0 Part XIX — Nonreporting IGA FFI Check box 32 to indicate that you are treated as a nonreporting IGA FFI. You must identify the IGA by entering the name of the jurisdiction that has the applicable IGA in effect with the United States and indicate whether it is a Model 1 or a Model 2 IGA. You must also provide the withholding agent with the specific category of entity described in Annex II of the IGA applicable to your status. In providing the specific category of FFI described in Annex II, you should use the language from Annex II that best and most specifically describes your status in the IGA. For example, indicate \"investment entity wholly owned by exempt beneficial owners\" rather than \"exempt beneficial owner.\" If you are a nonreporting IGA FFI claiming a deemed-compliant status under the regulations, you must instead indicate on this line which section of the regulations you qualify under. If you are a nonreporting financial institution under an applicable IGA because you qualify as an owner-documented FFI under the regulations, do not check \"Nonreporting IGA FFI.\" Instead you must check \"Owner-documented FFI\" and complete Part XI rather than this Part XIX. See instructions for line 9 for when a GIIN is required for a nonreporting IGA FFI (including a trustee of a trustee-documented trust that is a foreign person).   \\xa0 Part XX — Exempt Retirement Plans You must check the appropriate box to certify that you satisfy the requirements of exempt retirement plan status.  \\xa0 If you are not a flow-through entity or acting as an intermediary with respect to the payment for chapter 3 purposes, do not complete Form W-8IMY. If you are the beneficial owner of the payment and are claiming an exemption under sections 115(2), 892, or 895 as well as exempt beneficial owner status under Regulations section 1.1471-6 you should provide Form W-8EXP. If you are receiving payments which do not qualify for a statutory exemption from tax but for which you are claiming benefits under an applicable income tax treaty, provide Form W-8BEN-E.   \\xa0 Part XXI — Excepted Nonfinancial Group Entity You must check box 34 to certify that you satisfy the requirements of excepted nonfinancial group entity status.   \\xa0 Part XXII — Excepted Nonfinancial Start-Up Company You must check box 35 to certify that you satisfy the requirements of excepted nonfinancial start-up company status. You must also provide the date you were formed or your board passed a resolution (or equivalent measure) approving a new line of business (which cannot be that of a financial institution or passive NFFE).   \\xa0 Part XXIII — Excepted Nonfinancial Entity in Liquidation or Bankruptcy You must check box 36 to certify that you satisfy the requirements of excepted nonfinancial entity in liquidation or bankruptcy status. You must also provide the date that you filed a plan of liquidation, plan of reorganization, or bankruptcy petition.   \\xa0 Part XXIV — Publicly Traded NFFE or NFFE Affiliate of a Publicly Traded Corporation If you are a publicly traded NFFE, you must check box 37a to certify that you are not a financial institution and provide the name of a securities exchange on which your stock is publicly traded. If you are an NFFE that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group (as described in Regulations section 1.1471-5(i)) as a publicly traded U.S. or foreign entity, you must check box 37b to certify that you are a NFFE affiliate of a publicly traded corporation, provide the name of the publicly traded entity, and identify the securities market on which the stock of the publicly traded entity is traded. See Regulations section 1.1472-1(c)(1)(i) to determine if an entity is publicly traded.   \\xa0 Part XXV — Excepted Territory NFFE You must check box 38 to certify that you satisfy the requirements for excepted territory NFFE status. See Regulations section 1.1472-1(c)(1)(iii) for the definition of an excepted territory NFFE.   \\xa0 Part XXVI — Active NFFE You must check box 39 to certify that you satisfy the requirements of active NFFE status.   \\xa0 Part XXVII — Passive NFFE If you are a passive NFFE, you must check box 40 to certify that you are not a financial institution (other than an investment entity organized in a possession of the United States). You must also certify that you have provided a withholding statement associated with Form W-8IMY to the extent you are required to provide a withholding statement.  Note. If you would be a passive NFFE but for the fact that you are managed by certain types of FFIs (see Regulations section 1.1471-5(e)(4)(i)(B)), you should not complete Part XXVII as you would be considered a financial institution and not a passive NFFE.    \\xa0 Part XXVIII— Sponsored Direct Reporting NFFE If you are a sponsored direct reporting NFFE, you must check the box on line 42 to certify that you are not a financial institution and that you satisfy all relevant requirements for this classification. Enter the name of the sponsoring entity in line 41.   \\xa0 Part XXIX — Certification Form W-8IMY must be signed and dated by a person authorized to sign a declaration under penalties of perjury on behalf of the person whose name is on the form. By signing Form W-8IMY the authorized representative, officer, or agent also agrees to provide a new form within 30 days following a change in circumstances (unless no future payments will be made to the intermediary or flow-through entity by the withholding agent and the requestor does not need an updated form for chapter 4 purposes). A withholding agent may allow you to provide this form with an electronic signature. The electronic signature must indicate that the form was electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and a statement that the form has been electronically signed). Simply typing your name into the signature line is not an electronic signature.   \\xa0 Special Instructions  \\xa0 Entities Providing Certifications Under an Applicable IGA (Do Not Complete Line 5) An FFI in an IGA jurisdiction with which you have an account may provide you with a chapter 4 status certification other than as shown in Parts IX through XXVIII in order to satisfy its due diligence requirements under the applicable IGA. In such a case, you may attach the alternative certification to this Form W-8IMY in lieu of completing a certification otherwise required in Parts IX through XXVIII provided that you: (a) determine that the certification accurately reflects your status for chapter 4 purposes or under an applicable IGA; and (b) the withholding agent provides a written statement to you that it has provided the certification to meet its due diligence requirements as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA. For example, Entity A organized in Country A holds an account with an FFI in Country B. Country B has a Model 1 IGA in effect. The FFI in Country B may ask Entity A to provide a chapter 4 status certification based on the terms of the Country B IGA in order to fulfill its due diligence and documentation requirements under the Country B IGA. You may also provide with this form an applicable IGA certification if you are determining your chapter 4 status under the definitions provided in an applicable IGA and your certification identifies the jurisdiction that is treated as having an IGA in effect and describes your status as an NFFE or FFI in accordance with the applicable IGA. However, if you determine your status under an applicable IGA as an NFFE, you must still determine if you are an excepted NFFE under the regulations in order to complete this form unless you are provided an alternative certification by an FFI described in the preceding paragraph that covers your certification as an NFFE (such as \"active NFFE\") as defined in an applicable IGA. Additionally, you are required to comply with the conditions of your status under the law of the IGA jurisdiction if you are determining your status under that IGA. If you cannot provide the certifications in Parts IX through XXVIII, do not check a box in line 5. However, if you determine your status under the definitions of the IGA and can certify to a chapter 4 status included on this form, you do not need to provide the certifications described in this paragraph unless required by the FFI to whom you are providing this form. Any certifications provided under an applicable IGA remain subject to the penalties of perjury statement and other certifications made in Part XXIX.   \\xa0 Entities Providing Alternate or Additional Certifications Under Regulations If you qualify for a status that is not shown on of this form, you may attach applicable certifications for such status from any other Form W-8 on which the relevant certifications appear. If the applicable certifications do not appear on any Form W-8 (if, for example, new regulations provide for an additional status and this form has not been updated) then you may provide an attachment certifying that you qualify for the applicable status described in a particular Regulations section. Include a citation to the applicable provision in the Regulations. Any such attached certification becomes an integral part of this Form W-8IMY and is subject to the penalties of perjury statement and other certifications made in Part XXIX.
