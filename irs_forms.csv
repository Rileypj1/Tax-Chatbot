0,Instructions for Form 56 (12/2019),"   Instructions for Form 56 (12/2019)  Notice Concerning Fiduciary Relationship    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Revised: 12/2019        Instructions for Form 56 - Introductory Material         Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 56 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form56.     Photographs of Missing Children The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in instructions on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.      General Instructions      Purpose of Form Form 56 is used to notify the IRS of the creation or termination of a fiduciary relationship under section 6903 and provide the qualification for the fiduciary relationship under section 6036.    Form 56 cannot be used to update the last known address of the person, business, or entity for whom you are acting. Use Form 8822, Change of Address, or Form 8822-B, Change of Address or Responsible Party—Business, to update the last known address.     Who Should File Form 56 should be filed by a fiduciary (see Definitions below) to notify the IRS of the creation or termination of a fiduciary relationship under section 6903. For example, if you are acting as fiduciary for an individual, a decedent’s estate, or a trust, you may file Form 56. Receivers and assignees for the benefit of creditors also file Form 56 to give notice of qualification under section 6036. However, a bankruptcy trustee, debtor-in-possession, or other like fiduciary in a bankruptcy proceeding is not required to give notice of qualification under section 6036. Trustees, etc., in bankruptcy proceedings are subject to the notice requirements under title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy Rules).    Do not use Form 56 if you are notifying the IRS that you are the authorized representative of the taxpayer. Instead, use Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative. A fiduciary is treated by the IRS as if he or she is actually the taxpayer. Upon appointment, the fiduciary automatically has both the right and the responsibility to undertake all actions the taxpayer is required to perform. For example, the fiduciary must file returns and pay any taxes due on behalf of the taxpayer. An authorized representative is treated by the IRS as the agent of the taxpayer. He or she can only perform the duties authorized by the taxpayer, as indicated on Form 2848. An authorized representative is not required nor permitted to do anything other than the actions explicitly authorized by the taxpayer.     Definitions  Fiduciary. A fiduciary is any person in a position of confidence acting on behalf of any other person. A fiduciary assumes the powers, rights, duties, and privileges of the person or entity on whose behalf he or she is acting. Examples of fiduciaries include administrators, conservators, designees, executors, guardians, receivers, trustees of a trust, trustees in bankruptcy, personal representatives, persons in possession of property of a decedent’s estate, or debtors-in- possession of assets in any bankruptcy proceeding by order of the court.   Person. A person is any individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation.   Decedent’s estate. A decedent’s estate is a taxable entity separate from the decedent that comes into existence at the time of the decedent’s death. It generally continues to exist until the final distribution of the estate’s assets is made to the heirs and other beneficiaries.   Terminating entities. A terminating entity, such as a corporation, partnership, trust, etc., only has the legal capacity to establish a fiduciary relationship while it is in existence. Establishing a fiduciary relationship prior to termination of the entity allows the fiduciary to represent the entity on all tax matters after it is terminated.      When and Where To File  Notice of fiduciary relationship. Generally, you should file Form 56 when you create (or terminate) a fiduciary relationship. File Form 56 with the Internal Revenue Service Center where the person for whom you are acting is required to file tax returns.   Proceedings (other than bankruptcy) and assignments for the benefit of creditors. A fiduciary who is appointed or authorized to act as:    A receiver in a receivership proceeding or similar fiduciary (including a fiduciary in aid of foreclosure); or   An assignee for the benefit of creditors, must file Form 56 on, or within 10 days of, the date of appointment with the Advisory Group Manager, of the area office of the IRS having jurisdiction over the person for whom you are acting. See Pub. 4235, Collection Advisory Group Numbers and Addresses, for more information.      The receiver or assignee may also file a separate Form 56 with the service center where the person for whom the fiduciary is acting is required to file tax returns to provide the notice required by section 6903.       Specific Instructions      Part I—Identification Provide all the information called for in this part. If there is more than one fiduciary, each fiduciary must file a separate Form 56 or otherwise provide notice of their status to the IRS.  Name. File a separate Form 56 for each person for whom you are acting in a fiduciary capacity. For example, if you will be filing the decedent’s final Form 1040 and are the executor/administrator of the decedent’s estate, file one Form 56 entering the name of the decedent as the person for whom you are acting and file one Form 56 entering the name of the estate as the name of the person for whom you are acting.

Revised: 01/2017      Instrucciones para el  Anexo B (Formulario 941-PR) - Introductory Material    Acontecimientos Futuros Para obtener la información más reciente sobre los acontecimientos relacionados al Anexo B y sus instrucciones, como legislación promulgada después de que dichos documentos se hayan publicado, visite IRS.gov/form941pr.

Tiene que reportar cualquier crédito contributivo sobre la nómina de pequeños negocios calificados por aumentar las actividades investigativas que declaró en la línea 11 del  Formulario 941-PR, cuando radique su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B.  La obligación total para el trimestre tiene que ser igual a la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR. Si no reporta la cantidad declarada en la línea 11 del Formulario 941-PR, puede causar que la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR sea menos que la obligación total declarada en el Anexo B. No reduzca la obligación contributiva declarada en el Anexo B a una cantidad menor que cero.       Recordatorios  Declaración de ajustes hechos a períodos anteriores.  Los ajustes hechos a períodos anteriores se declaran en el Formulario 941-X (PR), Ajuste a la Declaración Federal TRIMESTRAL del Patrono o Reclamación de Reembolso, o en el Formulario 944-X (SP), Ajuste a la Declaración Federal ANUAL del Empleador o Reclamación de Reembolso, y no se toman en cuenta al calcular la obligación contributiva para el período en curso. Cuando radique un Anexo B con el Formulario 941-PR, no cambie su obligación contributiva por ajustes declarados en ningún Formulario 941-X (PR), o 944-X (SP).    Anexo B enmendado.  Si se le ha impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés), quizás pueda radicar un Anexo B enmendado. Consulte el tema Cómo Corregir la Obligación Contributiva que se ha Declarado Anteriormente, más adelante.      Instrucciones Generales    Propósito del Anexo B Estas instrucciones explican el Anexo B. Para determinar si es depositante bisemanal, visite IRS.gov y escriba ""depositante de itinerario bisemanal"" en el encasillado Search (Buscar). También consulte la Publicación 179, Guía Contributiva Federal para Patronos Puertorriqueños, o la Publicación 15, Employer's Tax Guide (Guía contributiva para los patronos), en inglés. La ley federal requiere que usted, como patrono, les retenga ciertas contribuciones a los cheques de salario de sus empleados. Cada vez que paga salarios, tiene que retener —es decir, descontar de los cheques de salario de sus empleados— ciertas cantidades para pagar la contribución al Seguro Social y la contribución al Medicare. También tiene que retener la Contribución Adicional al Medicare de los salarios en exceso de $200,000 que le paga a un empleado en un año natural. De acuerdo con el sistema de la retención de contribuciones, estas mismas que se les retienen a sus empleados se acreditarán en sus cuentas del Seguro Social para pagar sus obligaciones contributivas correspondientes. La ley federal también requiere que los patronos paguen toda obligación de la parte de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare que les corresponde. No se les retiene a los empleados esta parte de las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare. Indique su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B para cada día. Incluya las contribuciones al Seguro Social y al Medicare del patrono y del empleado. No use el Anexo B para declarar depósitos de la contribución federal. El Servicio Federal de Rentas Internas (IRS, por sus siglas en inglés) obtiene toda la información relacionada con los depósitos mediante el retiro electrónico de fondos.    El IRS usa el Anexo B para determinar si usted ha depositado a tiempo sus obligaciones contributivas federales sobre la nómina. Si no llena y radica correctamente su Anexo B junto con el Formulario 941-PR, el IRS podrá proponer una multa FTD""promediada"". Vea Multas relacionadas con los depósitos, en el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información.     ¿Quién Tiene Que Radicar el Anexo B? Radique el Anexo B si usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal. Usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal si sus contribuciones del período retroactivo ascienden a más de $50,000 o acumula una obligación contributiva de $100,000 o más en cualquier día del año natural en curso o el previo. Vea el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información.    No complete el Anexo B si tiene una obligación contributiva menor de $2,500 durante el trimestre.     ¿Cuándo Tiene Que Radicar? El Anexo B acompaña al Formulario 941-PR, Planilla para la Declaración Federal TRIMESTRAL del Patrono. Por lo tanto, la fecha de vencimiento del Anexo B es la misma fecha de vencimiento del Formulario 941-PR correspondiente. No radique el Anexo B como documento adjunto al Formulario 944(SP), Declaración Federal ANUAL de Impuestos del Patrono o Empleador. En vez de eso, si es depositante de itinerario bisemanal que tiene que radicar un registro de la obligación contributiva con el Formulario 944(SP), use el Formulario 943A-PR, Registro de la Obligación Contributiva Federal del Patrono Agrícola, o el Formulario 945-A, Annual Record of Federal Tax Liability (Registro anual de la obligación de impuestos federales), en inglés.    Instrucciones Específicas    Cómo Completar el Anexo B    Provea la Información de su Negocio Escriba su número de identificación patronal (EIN, por sus siglas en inglés) y su nombre en la parte superior del anexo. Asegúrese de que los mismos correspondan exactamente al nombre del negocio y al EIN que el IRS le asignó y también concuerden con el nombre y el EIN indicados en el Formulario 941-PR adjunto.     Año Natural Anote el año natural que corresponde al trimestre seleccionado.     Marque el Recuadro para el Trimestre Marque en la parte superior del Anexo B, bajo Informe para este trimeste, el recuadro apropiado del trimestre para el cual radica este anexo. Asegúrese de que el trimestre marcado en la parte superior del Anexo B corresponda exactamente al trimestre marcado en su Formulario 941-PR.     Anote su Obligación Contributiva para cada Mes El Anexo B se divide en los 3 meses que constituyen un trimestre típico de un año. Cada mes tiene 31 espacios enumerados que corresponden a las fechas de un mes típico. Anote sus obligaciones contributivas en los espacios que corresponden a las fechas en las cuales pagó salarios a sus empleados, y no en la fecha en la que se hicieron los depósitos correspondientes a la nómina. Por ejemplo, si su período de nómina terminó el 31 de diciembre de 2016 y pagó los salarios correspondientes a tal período el 6 de enero de 2017, usted:   Comenzaría con el Mes 1 (porque enero es el primer mes del trimestre) y Anotaría la obligación contributiva correspondiente en la línea 6 (porque la línea 6 representa el sexto día del mes).       Asegúrese de que marcó el recuadro apropiado en la Parte 2 del Formulario 941-PR para indicar que usted es depositante de itinerario bisemanal.     Obligación Total para el Trimestre Para determinar su obligación total para el trimestre, sume sus obligaciones contributivas de cada mes.            Obligación Contributiva del Mes 1     + Obligación Contributiva del Mes 2     +  Obligación Contributiva del Mes 3        Obligación Contributiva Total del Trimestre            Su obligación total para el trimestre tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de la línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR.      Ejemplo 1. El Patrono A es depositante de itinerario bisemanal que paga los salarios mensuales el último día del mes. El 24 de diciembre de 2017, el Patrono A también pagó a sus empleados las bonificaciones de fin de año (sujetas a las contribuciones sobre la nómina). Debido a que el Patrono A es depositante de itinerario bisemanal, el mismo tiene que informar sus obligaciones para las contribuciones sobre la nómina en el Anexo B. Para el cuarto trimestre (octubre, noviembre y diciembre), el Patrono A tiene que declarar su obligación contributiva de la manera siguiente:           Mes   Líneas de las fechas en las que se pagaron salarios          1 (octubre) línea 31 (día de pago, último día del mes)   2 (noviembre) línea 30 (día de pago, último día del mes)   3 (diciembre)  línea 24 (bonificaciones pagadas el 24 de diciembre de 2017)    3 (diciembre) línea 31 (día de pago, último día del mes)              Ejemplo 2. El Patrono B es un depositante de itinerario bisemanal que paga los salarios a sus empleados cada viernes alterno. El Patrono B acumuló una obligación de contribuciones sobre la nómina de $20,000 en cada una de las siguientes fechas de pago: 01/06/17, 01/20/17, 02/03/17, 02/17/17, 03/03/17, 03/17/17 y 03/31/17. Ya que el Patrono B es depositante de itinerario bisemanal, el Patrono B tiene que declarar su obligación contributiva en el Anexo B de la manera siguiente:           Mes   Líneas de las fechas en las que se pagaron salarios          1 (enero) líneas 6 y 20    2 (febrero) líneas 3 y 17    3 (marzo)  líneas 3, 17 y 31               Ejemplo 3. El Patrono C tiene un negocio nuevo y es depositante de itinerario mensual para 2017. El Patrono C paga los salarios a sus empleados todos los viernes y ha acumulado una obligación contributiva sobre la nómina de $2,000 el 01/13/17. El 01/20/17, y cada uno de los viernes subsiguientes durante 2017, el Patrono C acumuló una obligación contributiva sobre la nómina de $110,000. De acuerdo con las reglas de depósito, los patronos se convierten en depositantes de itinerario bisemanal el día después de cualquier día en el que acumulan $100,000 o más por concepto de obligación contributiva sobre la nómina durante un período de depósito. El Patrono C acumuló $112,000 el 01/20/17, el mismo se convirtió en depositante de itinerario bisemanal el día siguiente (01/21/17). Vea el apartado 11 de la Publicación 179 para más información. El Patrono C tiene que completar el Anexo B y radicarlo junto con el Formulario 941-PR como se muestra abajo.            Mes   Fechas en las cuales se pagaron los salarios   Cantidad que se debe declarar              1 (enero)  línea 13  $2,000     1 (enero)  líneas 20 y 27  $110,000     2 (febrero)  líneas 3, 10, 17 y 24  $110,000     3 (marzo)  líneas 3, 10, 17, 24 y 31  $110,000                       Cómo Corregir la Obligación Contributiva que se ha Declarado Anteriormente  Depositantes de itinerario bisemanal.  Si se le ha impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) correspondiente a un trimestre y cometió un error en el Anexo B y la corrección no cambiará el total de la obligación contributiva para el trimestre que declaró en el Anexo B, quizás pueda reducir la multa si radica un Anexo B corregido.    Ejemplo. Usted declaró $3,000 de obligación contributiva el día 1 del mes 1. Sin embargo, la obligación contributiva realmente corresponde al mes 3. Prepare un Anexo B enmendado que indique los $3,000 de obligación contributiva en el día 1 del mes 3. Además, tiene que anotar las obligaciones contributivas que había declarado anteriormente para el trimestre que no cambiaron. Escriba ""Enmendado"" en la parte superior del Anexo B. El IRS volverá a calcular la multa y le notificará de todo cambio a la multa.   Depositantes de itinerario mensual.  Los depositantes de itinerario mensual pueden radicar un Anexo B si se les ha impuesto una multa FTD correspondiente a un trimestre y cometieron un error en la parte para contribuciones mensuales del Formulario 941-PR. Cuando complete el Anexo B, debe anotar los totales mensuales porque no se requieren las anotaciones diarias.    Dónde debe radicar.  Radique su Anexo B enmendado en la dirección indicada en la notificación que recibió sobre la multa. No tiene que incluir el Anexo B original.      Formulario 941-X (PR)  Reducción en las contribuciones.  Si va a radicar un Formulario 941-X (PR) correspondiente a un trimestre, puede radicar el Anexo B enmendado junto con el Formulario 941-X (PR) si las dos condiciones siguientes le corresponden:  Tiene una reducción en las contribuciones. Le impusieron una multa FTD.    Radique su Anexo B enmendado junto con el Formulario 941-X (PR). La obligación contributiva total para el trimestre declarada en su Anexo B corregido tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de contribuciones corregida declarada en el Formulario 941-X (PR). Si su multa se reduce, el IRS incluirá la reducción de la multa junto con su reducción en las contribuciones.    Aumento en las contribuciones — Formulario941-X (PR) radicado a tiempo.  Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) a tiempo, no radique un Anexo B enmendado, a menos que se le haya impuesto una multa por no depositar (FTD, por sus siglas en inglés) debido a un Anexo B que falta (que no ha sido radicado anteriormente), que está incorrecto o que está incompleto. No incluya la cantidad de aumento en la contribución declarada en el Formulario 941-X (PR) en ningún Anexo B enmendado que usted radique.    Aumento en las contribuciones — Formulario941-X (PR) radicado fuera de plazo.  Si adeuda contribuciones y radica el Formulario 941-X (PR) fuera de plazo, o sea, después de la fecha de vencimiento para el trimestre en el que usted descubrió el error, tiene que radicar un Anexo B enmendado con el Formulario 941-X (PR). De otro modo, el IRS podría tasarle una multa ""promediada"" por no depositar. El total de la obligación contributiva declarada en la línea Obligación total para el trimestre del Anexo B enmendado tiene que ser igual a la cantidad total de contribuciones (línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR (línea 10 para trimestres que terminaron antes del 1 de enero de 2017) combinado con cualquier corrección declarada en la línea 18 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.      El Formulario 941-X (PR) será revisado en abril de 2017. Si utiliza la revisión de abril de 2017, la contribución total declarada en la línea Obligación total para el trimestre del Anexo B tiene que ser igual a la cantidad de la contribución corregida (línea 12 del Formulario 941-PR (línea 10 para trimestres que terminaron antes del 1 de enero de 2017) combinada con toda corrección declarada en la línea 19 del Formulario 941-X (PR)) para el trimestre, menos toda reducción y tasación contributiva libre de intereses que ha sido determinada previamente.

Form 965-E, Consent Agreement Under Section 965(i)(4)(D).      Although these forms were not released in time for reporting for 2019 tax years, the instructions for these new forms contain information that may be useful to filers of Form 965-A. As such, references to these new instructions have been added throughout the instructions for Form 965-A.     Background On December 22, 2017, section 965 of the Code was amended. As a result of the amendment, certain taxpayers are required to include in income an amount (a section 965(a) inclusion amount) based on the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of certain foreign corporations (specified foreign corporations) that are deferred foreign income corporations (DFICs) that they own either directly or indirectly through other entities. Other taxpayers may have inclusions in income under section 951(a) by reason of section 965 due to ownership of DFICs through domestic pass-through entities that are U.S. shareholders of the DFICs. When referring to both amounts in the preceding two sentences, these instructions use the term “section 965(a) inclusion.” Section 965 also allows for a deduction (section 965(c) deduction). Section 965(a) inclusions and corresponding section 965(c) deductions are taken into account based on the last tax year of the DFIC that begins before January 1, 2018. Certain taxpayers may make certain elections with respect to section 965. Relevant to this form, these elections include: (i) an election to pay a net 965 tax liability over 8 years, and (ii) an election by S corporation shareholders to defer payment of a net 965 tax liability with respect to an S corporation until a triggering event. In the case of the deferral election by S corporation shareholders, the deferred amounts are subject to annual reporting requirements, and when a triggering event occurs, the S corporation shareholder may then (subject to certain limitations) elect to pay the amount of the net 965 tax liability that is no longer subject to deferral over 8 years.      General Instructions      Purpose of Form This form should be used by individual taxpayers and entities taxed like individuals (for example, certain trusts and estates). This form is used to report a taxpayer’s net 965 tax liability for each tax year in which a taxpayer must report or pay section 965 amounts. In addition, this form is used to report the determination of a taxpayer’s net 965 tax liability, whether or not to be paid in installments; the payments of a net 965 tax liability to be paid in installments; adjustments of any net 965 tax liabilities outstanding, including any net 965 tax liability of the taxpayer that has been assumed by another taxpayer or any net 965 tax liability that the taxpayer has assumed; an S corporation shareholder’s net 965 tax liability with respect to an S corporation, whether or not to be deferred; and the beginning balance of, adjustments to, and ending balance of any deferred net 965 tax liabilities with respect to an S corporation. In summary, this form is intended to be a cumulative report of a taxpayer’s net 965 tax liabilities through payment in full. This form must be completed by a taxpayer for every tax year for which the taxpayer has any net 965 tax liability outstanding and not fully paid at any point during the tax year, including deferred net 965 tax liabilities with respect to an S corporation.     Definitions  Deferred foreign income corporation (DFIC). A DFIC is, with respect to any U.S. shareholder, any specified foreign corporation (as defined under section 965(e)) of a U.S. shareholder that has accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income (as defined under section 965(d)(2)) as of November 2, 2017, or December 31, 2017, that is greater than zero.   U.S. shareholder. For tax years of foreign corporations beginning before January 1, 2018, a U.S. shareholder is a U.S. person who owns (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation. A U.S. person for this purpose is defined in section 957(c) of the Code.   Net income tax liability. The taxpayer’s regular income tax liability reduced by the credits allowed under subparts A, B, and D of part IV of subchapter A (generally non-refundable credits).   Net 965 tax liability. The excess of the taxpayer’s net income tax liability computed with all section 965 amounts included (“with calculation”) over the taxpayer’s net income tax liability without regard to section 965 (“without calculation”). See Regulations section 1.965-7(g)(10) for rules for computing the net 965 tax liability.   S corporation-related net 965 tax liability. With respect to an S corporation, the excess of the taxpayer’s net income tax liability computed with all section 965 amounts included (which, in this case, includes only section 965 amounts allocated from such S corporation with respect to DFICs of which such S corporation is a U.S. shareholder) (“with calculation”) over the taxpayer’s net income tax liability without regard to section 965 (“without calculation”).   Reporting year. The tax year of the return with which this form is being filed.      Who Must File Any individual taxpayer (or taxpayer taxed like an individual) who has a net 965 tax liability for any tax year or has any net 965 tax liability remaining unpaid at any time during a tax year must file this form.     When and Where To File File Form 965-A with the income tax return of the taxpayer for the reporting year by the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) of the return.     Electronic Filing of Form 965-A If you file your income tax return electronically, Form 965-A is filed with the electronic income tax return. See the instructions for your income tax return for general information about electronic filing.      Specific Instructions      Amended Report Check the amended report box at the top of page 1 of the form if Form 965-A is filed with an amended return that is filed to change any reporting related to section 965, regardless of whether a Form 965-A has previously been filed.     Part I – Report of Net 965 Tax Liability and Election to Pay in Installments  Lines 1 through 8. Report in Part I net 965 tax liability amounts as follows. On lines 1 and 2, you must continue to report 2017 and/or 2018 amounts for all columns, including the original computation of net 965 tax liability reported in columns (b) through (i) on a prior-year Form 965-A. Report in column (j) any current-year net 965 tax liability transferred out (that is, for which you filed a valid transfer agreement as the transferor) or any current tax year subsequent adjustments. Also complete column (k), if applicable. For 2019 tax years, use line 3 to report section 965(a) inclusions derived solely through interests in pass-through entities that are U.S. shareholders of DFICs. Use lines 4 through 8 to report other amounts of net 965 tax liability of the taxpayer, such as:    Installment liability transfers in. The taxpayer may, in certain circumstances, and by agreement with the Secretary, assume as transferee the installment payment liability for the transferor's remaining net 965 tax liability and pay it in the same manner as if the taxpayer were the transferor. (See instructions for Form 965-C for more details.) If this occurs, the transferee should complete one of lines 4 through 8 in Part I as follows:   In column (a), enter the tax year of the net 965 tax liability for which the installment payment liability is being assumed. For example, if a net 965 tax liability incurred in tax year 2017 (with respect to which an installment payment election was made) was transferred to a transferee in 2022, in 2022 the taxpayer (transferee) reports “2017” in column (a).   Skip columns (b) through (i).   In column (j), report, as a positive number, the remaining installment payment liability (that is, original liability less payments made by the transferor) assumed by the taxpayer as transferee.   In column (k), report the tax identification number of the transferor.   Payments of such liability would then be reported on the corresponding line of Part II in the same manner as if the taxpayer were the transferor.  For example, assume Transferor had an original net 965 tax liability of $100 in year 1, when an installment payment election was made. In years 1 through 5, Transferor reports payments of five 8% installments. Then, in year 6, the liability to pay the remaining installments (15%, 20%, and 25%) totaling $60 is transferred to Taxpayer as transferee. Taxpayer would report on a line in Part I the tax year of the net 965 tax liability for which the installment payment liability is being assumed in column (a); the $60 amount of the transfer as a positive number in column (j); and the tax identification number of Transferor in column (k). In addition, on the corresponding line in Part II, Taxpayer would report the $15 installment payment made in column (g), Paid for Year 6 (the installment year as if Taxpayer were paying as Transferor). In the next reporting year, Taxpayer would report all the same information in Part II, plus the payment of $20 (20% of the original $100 liability) in column (h), Paid for Year 7. In the following reporting year, Taxpayer would report all the same information as in year 7, plus the final payment of $25 (25% of the original $100 liability) in column (i), Paid for Year 8.         Triggered deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability.  Deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liabilities become subject to payment when a triggering event occurs. (See instructions for Part III and Part IV for information concerning the computation, reporting, deferral election, and triggering events for S corporation-related net 965 tax liabilities.) When such a deferred liability is triggered, it must be transferred from Part IV, where it is annually reported, to Part I, column (f). Such a triggered S corporation-related net 965 tax liability is generally eligible for an election to be paid in 8 installments beginning in the year of the triggering event. In the case of a triggering event with respect to a deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, complete one of lines 4 through 8 as follows:     For certain triggered net 965 tax liabilities, the taxpayer may elect to pay in installments only with consent of the Secretary. (See instructions for Form 965-E for more details.) Without consent, the taxpayer must enter a checkmark in the “No” column of column (g) and enter the amount of the triggered liability in column (h).   If the taxpayer does not (or cannot) elect to pay the triggered deferred net 965 tax liability in installments, then report the amount from column (f) in column (h). This should equal the payment reported in the corresponding line of Part II, column (b), Paid for Year 1.   If the taxpayer elects to pay the triggered liability in installments, skip column (h) and report the amount from column (f) in column (i). The corresponding line in Part II, column (b), Paid for Year 1, should report an 8% payment of the amount elected to be paid in installments. The remaining payments should generally be reported in subsequent reporting years according to the installment schedule. (See instructions for Part II, line 1, for the general installment schedule.)         If lines 4 through 8 do not provide adequate lines to report all the taxpayer’s transactions described above, an additional Form 965-A should be used.       Note. Even if a net 965 tax liability was reported on a taxpayer’s income tax return and fully paid, because no elections were made, the taxpayer must complete the appropriate line in Part I and report the related payment on the corresponding line in Part II, column (b).     Note. If an installment election under section 965(h) or a deferral election under section 965(i) was made, then the taxpayer must complete the appropriate line in Part I, as well as the corresponding line in Parts II through IV, as applicable, to report the status of the net 965 tax liability and any related adjustments for the reporting year.      Column (b). Report the taxpayer’s net income tax liability for the tax year reported in column (a), with all section 965 amounts included (“with calculation”).   Column (c). Report the taxpayer’s net income tax liability for the tax year reported in column (a), without regard to section 965 (“without calculation”).   Column (d). Report the excess of the taxpayer’s “with calculation” reported in column (b) over the “without calculation” reported in column (c). This is the taxpayer’s net 965 tax liability for the tax year reported in column (a).   Column (e). If the taxpayer is a shareholder in one or more S corporation(s) with section 965 amounts, report the total of column (g) from Part III for the tax year reported in column (a). This is the total S corporation-related net 965 tax liability the taxpayer elected to defer. See detailed instructions for Part III regarding the S corporation-by-S corporation calculations and elections.   Column (f). Report the amount in column (d), less the amount in column (e), if any. This is the taxpayer’s net 965 tax liability eligible for the installment payment election.   Column (g). If the taxpayer made an election to pay a net 965 tax liability in installments over 8 years as provided for in section 965(h) and in the manner described in Regulations section 1.965-7(b)(2), enter a check mark in the “Yes” column. If “Yes,” skip column (h) and enter the amount from column (f) in column (i). Otherwise, enter a check mark in the “No” column. If “No,” enter the amount from column (f) in column (h) and skip column (i).    The actual payment of the first installment is due no later than the due date of the return for the tax year without extension, even if the election is made on a return filed by the extended due date.   Column (j). Report the following in column (j):    Report, as a negative number, any net 965 tax liability for the year reported in column (a) that has been transferred out to a transferee, by agreement with the Secretary, under which the transferee becomes liable for the remaining installments due on the liability in the same manner as if such transferee were the taxpayer. (See instructions for Form 965-C for more details.) In addition, provide the tax identification number of the transferee in column (k). For example, if the taxpayer (transferor) incurred a net 965 tax liability in tax year 2017, for which an installment payment election was made, then properly transferred the liability net of payments previously made, to a transferee in 2022, the taxpayer (transferor) would report, on line 1, column (j), as a negative number, the amount of the net liability transferred out. The making and reporting of payments on such liability should generally cease (see instructions for Part II, later).   Report any transfer in of a net 965 tax installment payment liability from a seller/transferor by a transferee (see the instructions for lines 1 through 8, earlier).         Report subsequent adjustments to the net 965 tax liability for the tax year reported in column (a) for which no amended return was required to be filed, such as an audit adjustment. A liability increase should be reported as a positive number and a decrease as a negative number.        Note. An adjustment of a net 965 tax liability elected to be paid in installments is generally prorated to all installments. For example, for tax year 2017, a taxpayer (TP) reported a $100 net 965 tax liability for which an installment election was made. For each of years 1 through 5, TP pays and reports an $8 installment. Also, in year 5, an audit adjustment increases the 2017 net 965 tax liability to $150, a $50 positive adjustment. No amended return was required and there was no negligence, intentional disregard, or fraud on the part of TP. This adjustment would be prorated to all the installments. TP would report the $50 adjustment in Part I, line 1, column (j), as a positive number, so the reported adjusted liability would be $150. In addition, TP would pay and report (in addition to the original $8 installment reported for year 5) $20 on Part II, line 1, column (f), representing 8% of the adjustment prorated to each of years 1 through 5, for which the installment due date had already arrived. For year 6, TP would pay and report $22.50 (15% of the adjusted $150 liability); for year 7, $30 (20% of the adjusted $150 liability); and for year 8, $37.50 (25% of the adjusted $150 liability). In a case in which a net 965 tax liability for a tax year is both adjusted and transferred, report the net adjustment/transfer number in column (j), a transferee tax identification number in column (k), and provide a statement, attached to this form, which includes details of the amounts netted in column (j).         Part II – Record of Amount of Net 965 Tax Liability Paid by the Taxpayer Part II is intended to be a cumulative record of the actual payments the taxpayer has made with respect to the net 965 tax liabilities reported in Part I.  Line 1. This line records the actual payments with respect to the net 965 tax liability reported on line 1 of Part I for the tax year 2017. The general installment payment schedule for a net 965 tax liability subject to an election to pay in installments is:    8% of the net 965 tax liability payable in year 1 (the year of the section 965(a) inclusion or triggering event with respect to a deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability),   8% of the net 965 tax liability payable in year 2,   8% of the net 965 tax liability payable in year 3,   8% of the net 965 tax liability payable in year 4,   8% of the net 965 tax liability payable in year 5,   15% of the net 965 tax liability payable in year 6,   20% of the net 965 tax liability payable in year 7, and   25% of the net 965 tax liability payable in year 8. If, for any reason, the actual payment differs from the schedule, report the actual payment made.  Example. If the reporting year is 2019 and the taxpayer is reporting a 2017 net 965 tax liability for which an installment payment election was made, because the 2019 reporting year is “Year 3” with respect to a 2017 net 965 tax liability being paid in installments, installment payments reported in Part II on line 1, the line for 2017, should generally be:    In column (b), Paid for Year 1, report 8% of the 2017 net 965 tax liability;   In column (c), Paid for Year 2, report 8% of the 2017 net 965 tax liability; and   In column (d), Paid for Year 3, report 8% of the 2017 net 965 tax liability.              Column (a). Report the tax year of the section 965(a) inclusion, the net 965 tax liability for which an installment payment liability is being assumed, or triggering event with respect to a deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, as reported on the corresponding line of Part I, column (a).   Columns (b) through (i). These columns are used to record the taxpayer’s cumulative payments, made each reporting year, for the net 965 tax liability reported on the corresponding line in Part I. If no installment election is made, the net 965 tax liability reported in Part I, column (h), should be paid and reported on the corresponding line of Part II, column (b), Paid for Year 1, and the remaining payment columns (c) through (i) left blank. If an installment election is made, and no transfers, acceleration events, or adjustments occur during the 8-year installment period, then 8% of the net 965 tax liability should be paid and reported in column (b), Paid for Year 1 (the year of the installment payment election). In the next reporting year, the relevant information from the prior reporting year should be carried forward, plus 8% of the net 965 tax liability should be paid and reported in column (c), Paid for Year 2. In future reporting years, the payments and payment reporting should continue similarly in accordance with the general installment payment schedule described above. If the taxpayer transfers out a net 965 tax liability, then the making and reporting of installment payments should generally cease for the transferred net 965 tax liability in the year of transfer; however, reporting with respect to the net 965 tax liability is still required for the reporting year if any net 965 tax liability of the taxpayer remains unpaid at any time during the reporting year. If an acceleration event occurs, then the unpaid portion of all remaining installments is due on the date of the acceleration event and should be paid and reported in the column for the year in which the acceleration event occurs; however, reporting with respect to the net 965 tax liability is still required for the reporting year if any net 965 tax liability of the taxpayer remains unpaid at any time during the reporting year. If an adjustment occurs to a net 965 tax liability for which an installment election has been made, including on an amended return, the adjustment should generally be prorated over all the installment payments. For the part of the adjustment prorated to installments whose payment date has already arrived, adjust the payment for the reporting year in which the adjustment is made and report accordingly. For the part of the adjustment prorated to installments for which the payment date has not yet arrived, pay and report in accordance with the installment schedule. Payments should include both actual installment payments made and excess payments of other income tax liabilities applied to the taxpayer’s net 965 tax liability.   Column (j). Report the net 965 tax liability remaining unpaid after the payment for the reporting year. This amount should equal the amount reported on the corresponding line in Part I, column (f), or column (i), as applicable, plus or minus any amount reported on the corresponding line in Part I, column (j), less any payments reported in Part II, columns (b) through (i).   Column (k). For each line, report only the payment made (if any) for the reporting year. Current-year reporting of column (k) amounts: Individuals: For tax year 2019, enter the amount from Form 965-A, Part II, column (k), line 3, on Schedule 2 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 9. All others: For all other filers (that is, other taxpayers taxed like an individual), follow the form instructions for that other applicable return.       Part III – S Corporation Shareholder: Report of Calculation of Net 965 Tax Liability Related to 965 Amounts Allocated from an S Corporation and Election To Defer Such Net 965 Tax Liability This Part allows a taxpayer that is an S corporation shareholder to report net 965 tax liabilities related to section 965 amounts with respect to S corporations. For each S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, the taxpayer may elect to defer payment of such liability until a triggering event occurs. (See instructions for Part IV for more information on triggering events.) Each S corporation-related net 965 tax liability is calculated on an individual S corporation basis, and an election to defer such liability is also made on an individual S corporation basis. Such liabilities deferred, if any, must be totaled by tax year, and the total carried to Part I, column (e), of the respective tax year line.  Lines 1 through 3. Report S corporation-related net 965 tax liabilities for the tax year indicated. On lines 1 and 2, you must continue to report 2017 and/or 2018 amounts for all columns, even though they were reported on a prior-year Form 965-A. Space is provided for reporting net 965 tax liabilities related to up to five S corporations. If additional lines are needed for the tax year, use additional Forms 965-A.   Column (a). Report the name of the S corporation from which the taxpayer is allocated section 965 amounts. Abbreviate as needed.   Column (b). Report the tax identification number of the S corporation reported in column (a). The tax identification number of an S corporation is its employer identification number (EIN).   Column (c). Report the taxpayer’s net income tax for the tax year calculated only with section 965 amounts allocated from this S corporation with respect to DFICs of which the S corporation is a U.S. shareholder. This is the S corporation-related “with calculation.”   Column (d). Report the taxpayer’s net income tax for the tax year calculated without regard to section 965, that is, the “without calculation.” This should equal the taxpayer’s net tax liability without section 965 amounts for the corresponding tax year reported in Part I, column (c).   Column (e). Report the excess of the taxpayer’s S corporation-related “with calculation” reported in column (c) over the “without calculation” reported in column (d). This is the taxpayer’s S corporation-related net 965 tax liability with respect to this S corporation for the tax year.   Column (f). If the taxpayer made an election to defer payment of this S corporation-related net 965 tax liability as provided for in section 965(i) and in the manner described in Regulations section 1.965-7(c)(2), enter a check mark in the “Yes” column. Otherwise, enter a check mark in the ""No"" column.   Column (g). If the taxpayer elected to defer an S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, enter the amount from column (e). (If the election was not made, then the liability remains a part of the taxpayer’s total net 965 tax liability subject to an installment payment election.) The total of column (g) for a tax year represents the taxpayer’s total deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability for the tax year and should be entered on the corresponding tax year line in Part I, column (e).      Part IV – Annual Report of Deferred Net 965 Tax Liability Related to 965 Amounts Allocated from S Corporations Any shareholder of an S corporation that makes an election to defer payment of an S corporation-related net 965 tax liability must report such liability with their income tax return for the year of election and every year thereafter through the year in which such amount is fully paid. Part IV provides for the required annual reporting of deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liabilities and any adjustments related to such deferred liabilities during the reporting year.    If the taxpayer fails to report for any year information required to be reported under section 965(i)(7) by the due date of the return for such year, 5% of the deferred net 965 tax liability shall be assessed as an addition to tax for such reporting year.  Column (a). Report the year of:    Deferral election. In a year for which an election is made to defer an S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, any amounts elected to be deferred must be transferred from Part III, column (g), to the corresponding line in Part IV, column (d). Enter the year for which the election is made in column (a) of the corresponding line.   Transfer in.  In certain circumstances, by agreement with the Secretary, a taxpayer may assume a deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability from another taxpayer who had elected to defer such amount. The transferee is liable for the deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability in the same manner as the transferor, including being subject to annual reporting requirements. (See instructions for Form 965-D for more details.) Enter the tax year of transfer in column (a). See the instructions for Part IV, column (g), later, for reporting the amount of the transfer in.        Column (b). Report the name of the S corporation to which the deferred net 965 tax liability relates. Abbreviate as needed.   Column (c). Report the tax identification number of the S corporation reported in column (b). The tax identification number of an S corporation is its employer identification number (EIN).   Column (d). Report the beginning deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability.    For the year of the deferral election, this amount will be the S corporation-related net 965 tax liability for which the taxpayer elects to defer payment and should be transferred from the corresponding line for such S corporation in Part III, column (g).   For subsequent reporting years, the amount reported should equal the amount on the corresponding line in column (i) from Part IV of Form 965-A for the prior reporting year.   For assumptions of deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liabilities, by agreement with the Secretary, the amount reported should equal the amount of S corporation-related net 965 tax liability assumed by the taxpayer.        Column (e). Reserved for future use.   Column (f). Report the amount of each deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, payment of which ceases to be deferred as a result of a triggering event during the reporting year (“triggered S corporation-related net 965 tax liability”). The triggered S corporation-related net 965 tax liability amount should be reported in column (f) as a negative number and transferred to column (f) on one of lines 4 through 8 in Part I as a positive number. See Triggered deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, in the instructions for Part I, lines 1 through 8, earlier.   Column (g). Report the amount of deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability transferred out or in.   Transfers (out). When a taxpayer transfers stock of an S corporation with respect to which the taxpayer has made an election to defer payment of its S corporation-related net 965 tax liability, the transfer is not treated as a triggering event if the transferee, by agreement with the Secretary, becomes liable for the deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability in the same manner as the transferor. (See instructions for Form 965-D for more details.) Report the amount of the transfer out as a negative number in column (g) of the same line as the taxpayer reported the deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability at the beginning of the reporting year. In a case of multiple transferees, report the total deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability transferred as a negative number in column (g) and in column (h) report the tax identification number of a transferee and attach a schedule to Form 965-A providing a breakdown of the total deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability transferred and the associated tax identification numbers of each transferee.   Transfers in. A taxpayer may assume, by agreement with the Secretary, a deferred 965 net tax liability as a buyer/transferee of S corporation stock with respect to which the transferor has a deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability. The taxpayer will then be liable for the deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability in the same manner as the transferee, including being subject to annual reporting requirements, beginning for the tax year of transfer. (See instructions for Form 965-D for more details.) For the year of transfer, a new line in Part IV must be completed, skipping columns (d), (e), and (f), and entering in both columns (g) and (i) the deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability transferred in as a positive number. For reporting years following the year of transfer, report the transferred deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liability in the same fashion as all other deferred S corporation-related net 965 tax liabilities.   Column (h). Provide the tax identification number of the transferee or transferor.   Column (i). For each line, combine the amounts reported in columns (d) through (g).

60,Instructions for Form 990-T (2019),"   Instructions for Form 990-T (2019)  Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return (and Proxy Tax Under Section 6033(e))    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    2019        Instructions for Form 990-T - Introductory Material       Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 990-T and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form990T.     What's New  Qualified transportation fringes. P.L. 116-94 retroactively repealed the inclusion in unrelated business taxable income of certain benefits, including qualified transportation fringes. For 2019, do not enter an amount on line 33. If you want to claim a refund for 2017 or 2018, file an amended Form 990-T.   Extended tax provisions. Recent legislation extended certain tax benefits that had expired at the end of 2017. These tax benefits include the following.     Biofuel producer credit.   Biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels credit.      If you are eligible for one or more of these benefits in 2019, you can claim them on your 2019 return. If you are eligible for one or more of these benefits for tax year 2018, you will need to file an amended Form 990-T return to claim them.   Increase in minimum penalty for failure to file. For returns due after 2019, the minimum penalty for failure to file a return that is more than 60 days late has increased to the smaller of the tax due or $435.   Qualified Opportunity Investment. If you deferred a capital gain into a qualified opportunity fund (QOF), attach Schedule D, Form 8949, and Form 8997, Initial and Annual Statement of Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments, to your return. You will need to file Form 990-T with Form 8997 attached annually until you dispose of the investment. See the Instructions for Form 8997.    Qualified business income deduction. If you are a trust filing Form 990-T and have unrelated business income, you may have Qualified Business Income (QBI) and may be allowed a QBI deduction under section 199A. See line 38, later, for more information.   Adjustments to tax attributable to partner's audit liability. If your organization received Form 8986, Partner's Share of Adjustment(s) to Partnership-Related Item(s), from one or more partnerships that have elected to push out adjustments to partnership-related items to their partners, see the instructions for line 45 and line 46e.      Reminder  Separate UBTI calculation for each trade or business. Organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business must compute unrelated business taxable income (UBTI), including for purposes of determining any net operating loss deduction, separately with respect to each trade or business. See Schedule M (Form 990-T). The UBTI with respect to any such trade or business shall not be less than zero when computing total UBTI.   Don't include social security numbers on publicly disclosed forms. Because the IRS is required to publicly disclose a 501(c)(3) organization’s Form 990-T returns, social security numbers should not be included on this form. Documents subject to disclosure include schedules and attachments filed with the form. See Public Inspection Requirements of Section 501(c)(3) Organizations, later.       General Instructions      Purpose of Form Use Form 990-T and Schedule M (as applicable) to:    Report unrelated business income;   Figure and report unrelated business income tax liability;   Report proxy tax liability;   Claim a refund of income tax paid by a regulated investment company (RIC) or a real estate investment trust (REIT), on undistributed long-term capital gain;   Request a credit for certain federal excise taxes paid or for small employer health insurance premiums paid; and   Report unrelated business income tax on reinsurance entities.         Who Must File  The following entities must file Form 990-T.    Any domestic or foreign organization exempt under section 501(a), section 529(a), or section 529A(a), if it has gross income of $1,000 or more from a regularly conducted unrelated trade or business (see Regulations section 1.6012-2(e)). Gross income is gross receipts minus the cost of goods sold (see Regulations section 1.61-3). For a discussion of cost of goods sold see Schedule A. Cost of Goods Sold, later.    The gross receipts from a gaming business include all amounts wagered in games, not just the net proceeds after payment of prizes and other expenses. Cash prizes aren't included in cost of goods sold but are reported on line 27 as other deductions.    A disregarded entity, as described in Regulations sections 301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3, is treated as a branch or division of its parent organization for federal tax purposes. Therefore, financial information applicable to a disregarded entity must be reported as the parent organization's financial information.   Organizations liable for the proxy tax on lobbying and political expenditures. See Line 42. Proxy Tax, later, for a discussion of the proxy tax. If your organization is only required to file because of the proxy tax, see Proxy Tax Only under Which Parts To Complete, later.   Colleges and universities of states and other governmental units, and subsidiary corporations wholly owned by such colleges and universities. However, a section 501(c)(1) corporation that is an instrumentality of the United States and both organized and exempt from tax by an Act of Congress doesn’t have to file.   Applicable reinsurance entities under the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), section 1341(c)(1), must write ""Applicable Reinsurance Entity"" across the top of Form 990-T.   Organizations that are liable for other taxes (such as the section 1291 tax (Form 990-T, line 40 or 41) or recapture taxes (Form 990-T, line 48)). See a discussion of these items, later. If your organization is only required to file Form 990-T because of these taxes, see Other Taxes under Which Parts To Complete, later.   Qualified tuition programs described under section 529 that have $1,000 or more of unrelated trade or business gross income.   Qualified ABLE programs described under section 529A that have $1,000 or more of unrelated trade or business gross income.   Trustees for the following trusts that have $1,000 or more of unrelated trade or business gross income: 	1. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs), including traditional IRAs described under section 408(a), 	2. Simplified employee pension IRAs (SEP IRAs) described under section 408(k), 	3. Savings incentive match plan for employees of small employers IRAs (SIMPLE IRAs) described under section 408(p), 	4. Roth IRAs described under section 408A, 	5. Coverdell education savings accounts (ESAs) described under section 530(b), 	6. Archer medical savings accounts (Archer MSAs) described under section 220(d), and 	7. Health savings accounts (HSAs) described under section 223(d).         Each account of a type listed above is treated as a separate trust for unrelated business income tax purposes (even if there is a single owner or beneficiary for multiple accounts). A custodian is treated as a trustee. See section 408(h). Individual retirement annuities, unlike individual retirement accounts, aren't subject to unrelated business income tax.    IRAs and other tax-exempt shareholders in a RIC or REIT filing Form 990-T only to obtain a refund of income tax paid on undistributed long-term capital gains should complete Form 990-T as explained in IRAs and other tax-exempt shareholders in a RIC or REIT, later.  Qualified Opportunity Investment. If you deferred a capital gain into a qualified opportunity fund (QOF), you must file your Form 990-T with Schedule D, Form 8949, and Form 8997 attached. You will need to file Form 990-T with Form 8997 attached annually until you dispose of the investment. See the Instructions for Form 8997.      Definitions  Section 501(c)(3) organization. Section 501(c)(3) describes certain organizations which are exempt from taxation under section 501(a). A 501(c)(3) organization is an organization organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes. See Regulations section 1.501(c)(3)-1(a).   Annual return. An annual return (for purposes of the public inspection rules discussed below) is an exact copy of the Form 990-T that was filed with the IRS, including all schedules and attachments. It also includes any amendments to the original return (amended return). By annual return (for purposes of the public inspection rules discussed below), we mean any annual return (defined above) that isn't more than 3 years old from the later of:    The date the return is required to be filed (including extensions), or   The date that the return is actually filed.        Applicable reinsurance entity. An applicable reinsurance entity is a not-for-profit organization:    The purpose of which is to help stabilize premiums for coverage in the individual and small group markets in a state during the first 3 years of operation of the state's American Health Benefit Exchange for such markets within the state when the risk of adverse selection related to new rating rules and market changes is greatest, and   The duties of which are to conduct the reinsurance program under ACA section 1341 by coordinating the funding and operation of the risk-spreading mechanisms designed to implement the reinsurance program of the Act.        Directly connected expenses. To be deductible in computing unrelated business taxable income, expenses, depreciation, and similar items must qualify as deductions allowed by section 162, 167, or other sections, and must be directly connected with the conduct of unrelated trade or business activity. To be directly connected with the conduct of an unrelated trade or business activity, expenses, depreciation, and similar items must bear a proximate and primary relationship to the conduct of the activity. For example, where facilities and/or personnel are used both to conduct exempt activities and to conduct an unrelated trade or business, expenses and similar items attributable to such facilities and/or personnel must be allocated between the two uses on a reasonable basis. The portion of any such item allocated to the unrelated trade or business must bear a proximate and primary relationship to that unrelated trade or business.   Not substantially related to. Not substantially related to means the activity that produces the income doesn’t contribute importantly to the exempt purposes of the organization, other than the need for funds. Whether an activity contributes importantly depends in each case on the facts involved. For details, see Pub. 598, Tax on Unrelated Business Income of Exempt Organizations.   Trade or business. A trade or business is any activity conducted for the production of income from selling goods or performing services. An activity must be conducted with intent to profit to constitute a trade or business. An activity doesn’t lose its identity as a trade or business merely because it is conducted within a larger group of similar activities that may or may not be related to the exempt purpose of the organization. If, however, an activity conducted for profit is an unrelated trade or business, no part of it can be excluded from this classification merely because it doesn’t result in profit.   Separate trade or business. An organization with more than one unrelated trade or business should refer to Notice 2018-67, 2018-36 I.R.B. 409 when determining what trades or businesses are separate trades or businesses for purposes of calculating UBTI.    Unrelated trade or business income. Unrelated trade or business income is the gross income derived from any trade or business (defined above) regularly carried on and not substantially related to (defined above) the organization's exempt purpose or function (aside from the organization's need for income or funds or the use it makes of the profits). Generally, for section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) organizations, unrelated trade or business income is derived from nonmembers with certain modifications (see section 512(a)). For a section 511(a)(2)(B) state college or university, or a corporation wholly owned by such a college or university, unrelated trade or business income is derived from activities not substantially related to exercising or performing any purpose or function described in section 501(c)(3). An unrelated trade or business doesn’t include a trade or business:     In which substantially all the work is performed for the organization without compensation; or   That is conducted by a section 501(c)(3) or 511(a)(2)(B) organization mainly for the convenience of its members, students, patients, officers, or employees; or   That sells items of work-related equipment and clothes, and items normally sold through vending machines, food dispensing facilities or by snack bars, by a local association of employees described in section 501(c)(4), organized before May 27, 1969, if the sales are for the convenience of its members at their usual place of employment; or   That sells merchandise substantially all of which was received by the organization as gifts or contributions; or   That consists of qualified public entertainment activities regularly conducted by a section 501(c)(3), (4), or (5) organization as one of its substantial exempt purposes (see section 513(d)(2) for the meaning of qualified public entertainment activities); or   That consists of qualified convention or trade show activities regularly conducted by a section 501(c)(3), (4), (5), or (6) organization as one of its substantial exempt purposes (see section 513(d)(3) for the meaning of qualified convention and trade show activities); or   That furnishes one or more services described in section 501(e)(1)(A) by a hospital to one or more hospitals subject to conditions in section 513(e); or   That consists of qualified pole rentals, as defined in section 501(c)(12)(D), by a mutual or cooperative telephone or electric company; or   That includes activities relating to the distribution of low-cost articles, each costing $11.10 or less, by an organization described in section 501 and contributions to which are deductible under section 170(c)(2) or (3) if the distribution is incidental to the solicitation of charitable contributions; or   That includes the exchange or rental of donor or membership lists between organizations described in section 501 and contributions to which are deductible under section 170(c)(2) or (3); or   That consists of bingo games as defined in section 513(f). Generally, a bingo game isn't included in any unrelated trade or business if:    Wagers are placed, winners are determined, and prizes are distributed in the presence of all persons wagering in that game, and   The game doesn’t compete with bingo games conducted by for-profit businesses in the same jurisdiction, and   The game doesn’t violate state or local law; or      That consists of conducting any game of chance by a nonprofit organization in the state of North Dakota and the conducting of the game doesn’t violate any state or local law; or   That consists of soliciting and receiving qualified sponsorship payments that are solicited or received after December 31, 1997. Generally, qualified sponsorship payment means any payment to a tax-exempt organization by a person engaged in a trade or business in which there is no arrangement or expectation of any substantial return benefit by that person other than the use or acknowledgment of that person's name, logo, or product lines in connection with the activities of the tax-exempt organization. See section 513(i).           When To File  An employees' trust defined in section 401(a), an IRA (including SEPs and SIMPLEs), a Roth IRA, a Coverdell ESA, or an Archer MSA must file Form 990-T by the 15th day of the 4th month after the end of its tax year. All other organizations must file Form 990-T by the 15th day of the 5th month after the end of their tax years. If the regular due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, file no later than the next business day. If the return is filed late, see Interest and Penalties, later.  Extension. Filers may request an automatic extension of time to file Form 990-T by using Form 8868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File an Exempt Organization Return.     Amended return. To correct errors or change a previously filed return, write ""Amended Return"" at the top of the return. Also, include a statement that indicates the line number(s) on the original return that was changed and give the reason for each change. Generally, the amended return must be filed within 3 years after the date the original return was due or 3 years after the date the organization filed it, whichever is later.      Where To File  U.S. Mail. Send Form 990-T and all other required information to:  Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Center Ogden, UT 84201-0027     Private Delivery Service. Organizations can use certain private delivery services (PDSs) designated by the IRS to meet the ""timely mailing as timely filing"" rule for tax returns. Go to IRS.gov/PDS for the list of PDS. The PDS can tell you how to get written proof of the mailing date. For the IRS mailing address to use if you're using PDSs, go to IRS.gov/PDSstreetAddresses and select the last Submission Processing Center address for filing Form 990-T using a PDS.     Private delivery services can't deliver items to P.O. boxes. You must use the U.S. Postal Service to mail any item to an IRS P.O. box address.     Estimated Tax Payments Generally, an organization filing Form 990-T must make installment payments of estimated tax if its estimated tax (tax minus allowable credits) is expected to be $500 or more. Both corporate and trust organizations use Form 990-W, Estimated Tax on Unrelated Business Taxable Income for Tax-Exempt Organizations, to figure their estimated tax liability. Don't include the proxy tax when computing your estimated tax liability for 2019. To figure estimated tax, only trusts must take the alternative minimum tax (if applicable) into account. See Form 990-W for more information.     Depository Method of Tax Payment The organization must pay any tax due in full by the due date of the return without extension.       Electronic Deposit Requirement    The organization must deposit all depository taxes (such as employment tax, excise tax, and corporate income tax) electronically. Generally, electronic fund transfers are made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). For more information about EFTPS or to enroll in EFTPS, visit the EFTPS website at IRS.gov/EFTPS, or call 1-800-555-4477 (TTY/TDD 1-800-733-4829). You can also get Pub. 966, Electronic Federal Tax Payment System: A Guide to Getting Started.   Depositing on time. For EFTPS deposits to be made timely, the organization must submit the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the deposit is due.     Same-day wire payment option. If you fail to submit a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Application (FTA), a same-day federal tax payment system that works in conjunction with EFTPS. Make arrangements with your financial institution ahead of time, noting the institution's availability, deadlines, and costs, if you believe you would ever need the same-day wire payment option. To learn more, visit ElectronicFederalTaxPaymentSystem.      Timeliness of deposits. The IRS will use business days to determine the timeliness of deposits. Business days are any day that isn’t a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia.      If the organization owes tax when it files Form 990-T, don't include the payment with the tax return. Instead, use EFTPS.     Interest and Penalties Your organization may be subject to interest and penalty charges if it files a late return or fails to pay tax when due. Generally, the organization isn't required to include interest and penalty charges on Form 990-T because the IRS can figure the amount and bill the organization for it.  Interest. Interest is charged on taxes not paid by the original due date for the return even if the organization uses Form 8868 to request an automatic extension of time to file. Interest is also charged on penalties imposed for failure to file, negligence, fraud, substantial valuation misstatements, and substantial understatements of tax from the due date (including extension) to the date of payment. The interest charge is figured at the underpayment rate determined under section 6621.   Late filing of return. An organization that fails to file its return when due (including extension of time for filing) is subject to a penalty of 5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the return is late, up to a maximum of 25% of the unpaid tax. The minimum penalty for a return that is more than 60 days late is the smaller of the tax due or $435. The penalty won't be imposed if the organization can show that the failure to file on time was due to reasonable cause. If you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don’t include an explanation when you file your return.   Late payment of tax. The penalty for late payment of taxes is usually ½ of 1% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the tax is unpaid. The penalty can’t exceed 25% of the unpaid tax. If you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable-cause criteria. Don’t include an explanation when you file your return.   Estimated tax penalty. An organization that doesn’t make estimated tax payments when due may be subject to an underpayment penalty for the period of underpayment. Generally, an organization is subject to this penalty if its tax liability for the tax year is $500 or more and it didn’t make estimated tax payments of at least the smaller of its tax liability for the tax year or 100% of the prior year's tax. See section 6655 for details and exceptions.  Form 2220, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Corporations, is used by corporations and trusts filing Form 990-T to see if the organization owes a penalty and its amount. Generally, the organization isn't required to file this form because the IRS can figure the amount of any penalty and notify the organization. However, even if the organization doesn’t owe the penalty, you must complete and attach Form 2220 if either of the following applies.     The annualized income or adjusted seasonal installment method is used.   The organization is a ""large organization"" computing its first required installment based on the prior year's tax.      If you attach Form 2220, check the box on Form 990-T, line 53, and enter the amount of any penalty on this line.   Trust fund recovery penalty. This penalty may apply if certain excise, income, social security, and Medicare taxes that must be collected or withheld aren't paid to the United States Treasury. These taxes are generally reported on:    Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return;   Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return;   Form 943, Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees; or   Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax.      The trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to have been responsible for collecting, accounting for, and paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. The penalty is equal to the unpaid trust fund tax. See the Instructions for Form 720; Pub. 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide; or Pub. 51 (Circular A), Agricultural Employer's Tax Guide, for details, including the definition of responsible persons.   Other penalties. There are also penalties that can be imposed for negligence, substantial understatement of tax, reportable transaction understatements, and fraud. See sections 6662, 6662A, and 6663.      Which Parts To Complete    If you are filing Form 990-T only because of the proxy tax, other taxes, or only to claim a refund, go directly to Proxy Tax Only, Other Taxes, or Claim for Refund, later.

The heading (above Part I) except items E, H, and I;   Lines 42 and 45;   Part V;   Signature area; and   Attach a statement showing the proxy tax computation.             Other Taxes    Organizations that are required to file Form 990-T only because they are liable for recapture taxes, the section 1291 tax, the tax on a hospital organization’s non-compliant facility income, or other items listed in the instructions for line 48 must complete the following.    The heading above Part I except items E, H, and I;   The appropriate lines of Parts IV and V;   Signature area; and   Attach all appropriate forms and/or schedules showing the computation of the applicable tax or taxes.             Claim for Refund    If your only reason for filing a Form 990-T is to claim a refund, complete the following:    The heading above 	Part I except items E, H, and I;   Enter -0- on line 13, column (A), line 39, and line 49;   Enter the credit or payment on the appropriate line (51a-51g);   Lines 52, 55, and 56; and   Signature area.      For claims described below, follow the additional instructions for that claim.    IRAs and other tax-exempt shareholders in a RIC or REIT.

If you are a trustee of more than one IRA invested in a RIC, you may be able to file a composite Form 990-T to claim a refund of tax under section 852(b) instead of filing a separate Form 990-T for each IRA. See Notice 90-18, 1990-1 C.B. 327, for information on who can file a composite return. Complete steps above under Claim For Refund and follow the additional requirements in the notice.     Backup withholding. If your only reason for filing Form 990-T is to claim a refund of backup withholding, complete steps above under Claim for Refund and attach a copy of the Form 1099 showing the withholding.       Consolidated Returns The consolidated return provisions of section 1501 don't apply to exempt organizations, except for organizations having title holding companies. If a title holding corporation described in section 501(c)(2) pays any amount of its net income for a tax year to an organization exempt from tax under section 501(a) (or would, except that the expenses of collecting its income exceeded that income), and the corporation and organization file a consolidated return as described below, then treat the title holding corporation as being organized and operated for the same purposes as the other exempt organization (in addition to the purposes described in section 501(c)(2)). Two organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a), one a title holding company and the other earning income from the first, will be includible corporations for purposes of section 1504(a). If the organizations meet the definition of an affiliated group and the other relevant provisions of Chapter 6 of the Code, then these organizations may file a consolidated return. The parent organization must attach Form 851, Affiliations Schedule, to the consolidated return. For the first year a consolidated return is filed, the title holding company must attach Form 1122, Authorization and Consent of Subsidiary Corporation To Be Included in a Consolidated Income Tax Return. See Regulations section 1.1502-100.     Other Forms That May Be Required  Forms W-2 and W-3.

Figure taxable income using the method of accounting regularly used in keeping the organization's books and records. Generally, permissible methods include:    Cash,   Accrual, or   Any other method authorized by the Code.      In all cases, the method used must clearly show taxable income. See Pub. 538, Accounting Periods and Methods.  Change in accounting method. To change the method of accounting used to report taxable income (for income as a whole or for the treatment of any material item), the organization must file with the IRS either an (a) advanced consent request for a ruling or (b) automatic change request for certain specific changes in accounting method. In either case, the organization must file Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method. See Pub. 538.     Section 481(a) adjustment. The organization may have to make an adjustment under section 481(a) to prevent amounts of income or expense from being duplicated or omitted. The section 481(a) adjustment period is generally 1 year for a net negative adjustment and 4 years for a net positive adjustment. However, an organization may elect a 1-year adjustment period for a net positive section 481(a) adjustment that is less than $50,000. The organization may have to complete the appropriate lines of Form 3115 to make the election. See the Instructions for Form 3115 for more information and exceptions. Include any net positive section 481(a) adjustment on Form 990-T, line 12. If the net section 481(a) adjustment is negative, report it on Form 990-T, line 27.      Accounting Period The return must be filed using the organization's established annual accounting period. If the organization has no established accounting period, file the return on the calendar-year basis. To change an accounting period, some organizations may make a notation on a timely filed Form 990, 990-EZ, 990-PF, or 990-T. Others may be required to file Form 1128, Application To Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year. For details on which procedure applies to your organization, see Rev. Proc. 85-58, 1985-2 C.B. 740, and the Instructions for Form 1128. If the organization changes its accounting period, file Form 990-T for the short period that begins with the first day after the end of the old tax year and ends on the day before the first day of the new tax year. For the short period return, figure the tax by placing the organization's taxable income on an annual basis. For details, see section 443.       Reporting Form 990-T Information on Other Returns    Your organization may be required to file an annual information return on:    Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax;   Form 990-EZ, Short Form Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax;   Form 990-PF, Return of Private Foundation or Section 4947(a)(1) Nonexempt Charitable Trust Treated as a Private Foundation; or   Form 5500, Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan.      If so, include on that information return the unrelated business gross income and expenses (but not including the specific deduction claimed on line 38, or any expense carryovers from prior years) reported on Form 990-T for the same tax year.        Rounding Off to Whole Dollars    The organization may enter decimal points and cents when completing its return. However, the organization should round off cents to whole dollars on its return, forms, and schedules to make completing its return easier. The organization must either round off all amounts on its return to whole dollars, or use cents for all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $8.40 rounds to $8 and $8.50 rounds to $9. If two or more amounts must be added to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total.        Attachments     If you need more space on the form or schedules, attach separate sheets (statements). On the attachment, write the corresponding form or schedule number or letter and follow the same format. Show totals on the IRS-printed form. Also, include the organization's name and EIN. The separate sheets should be the same size as the IRS-printed form and should be attached after the IRS-printed form.        Public Inspection Requirements of Section 501(c)(3) Organizations    Under section 6104(d), a section 501(c)(3) organization that files Form 990-T must make its entire annual exempt organization business income tax return (including amended returns) available for public inspection. The Form 990-T and related schedules must be made available for public inspection for a period of 3 years from the date the Form 990-T is required to be filed, including any extension.        What Schedules and Attachments to Form 990-T Must Be Made Available for Public Inspection?    Only schedules, attachments (statements), and supporting documents that relate to the imposition of tax on unrelated business income must be made available for public inspection when attached to a section 501(c)(3) organization's Form 990-T filed after August 17, 2006. The following documents, when attached to a section 501(c)(3) organization's Form 990-T filed after August 17, 2006, aren't required to be made available for public inspections.    Form 926, Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation;   Form 5471, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Corporations;   Form 8271, Investor Reporting of Tax Shelter Registration Number;   Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060;   Form 8621, Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund;   Form 8832, Entity Classification Election;   Form 8858, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Foreign Disregarded Entities;   Form 8865, Return of U.S. Person with Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships;   Form 8886, Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement;   Form 8913, Credit for Federal Telephone Excise Tax Paid;   Form 8925, Report of Employer-Owned Life Insurance Contracts;   Form 8941, Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums; and   Form 8975, Country-by-Country Report.            Public Inspection    How Does a 501(c)(3) Organization Make Its Annual Returns Available for Public Inspection? A 501(c)(3) organization must make its annual returns available in two ways.    By office visitation, and   By providing copies or making them widely available.            Public Inspection by Office Visitation    A 501(c)(3) organization must make its annual returns available for public inspection without charge at its principal, regional, and district offices during regular business hours.  Conditions that may be set for public inspection at the office. A 501(c)(3) organization:     May have an employee present,   Must allow the individual conducting the inspection to take notes freely during the inspection, and   Must allow an individual to make photocopies of documents at no charge but only if the individual brings photocopying equipment to the place of inspection.        Determining if a site is a regional or district office. A regional or district office is any office of a 501(c)(3) organization, other than its principal office, that has paid employees whose total number of paid hours a week are normally 120 hours or more. Include the hours worked by part-time (as well as full-time) employees in making that determination.    What sites aren't considered a regional or district office. A site isn't considered a regional or district office if:     The only services provided at the site further the organization's exempt purposes (for example, day care, health care, or scientific or medical research), and   The site doesn’t serve as an office for management staff, other than managers who are involved only in managing the exempt function activities at the site.           What if the 501(c)(3) organization doesn’t maintain a permanent office? If the 501(c)(3) organization doesn’t maintain a permanent office, it will comply with the public inspection by office visitation requirement by making the annual returns available at a reasonable location of its choice. It must permit public inspection:    Within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a request for inspection (normally, not more than 2 weeks), and   At a reasonable time of day.          Optional method of complying. If a 501(c)(3) organization that doesn’t have a permanent office wishes not to allow an inspection by office visitation, it may mail a copy of the requested documents instead of allowing an inspection. However, it must mail the documents within 2 weeks of receiving the request and may charge for copying and postage only if the requester consents to the charge.     501(c)(3) organizations with a permanent office but limited or no hours. Even if a 501(c)(3) organization has a permanent office but no office hours or very limited hours during certain times of the year, it must still meet the office visitation requirement. To meet this requirement during those periods when office hours are limited or not available, follow the rules above under What if the 501(c)(3) organization doesn’t maintain a permanent office?         Public Inspection—Providing Copies    A 501(c)(3) organization must provide copies of its annual returns to any individual who makes a request for a copy in person or in writing unless it makes these documents widely available.  In-person requests for document copies. A 501(c)(3) organization must provide copies to any individual who makes a request in person at the 501(c)(3) organization's principal, regional, or district offices during regular business hours on the same day that the individual makes the request.    Accepted delay in fulfilling an in-person request. If unusual circumstances exist and fulfilling a request on the same day places an unreasonable burden on the 501(c)(3) organization, it must provide copies by the earlier of:     The next business day following the day that the unusual circumstances end, or   The fifth business day after the date of the request.      Examples of unusual circumstances include:     Receipt of a volume of requests (for document copies) that exceeds the 501(c)(3) organization's daily capacity to make copies,   Requests received shortly before the end of regular business hours that require an extensive amount of copying, or   Requests received on a day when the 501(c)(3) organization's managerial staff capable of fulfilling the request is conducting official duties (for example, student registration or attending an off-site meeting or convention) instead of its regular administrative duties.          Use of local agents for providing copies. A 501(c)(3) organization may use a local agent to handle in-person requests for document copies. If a 501(c)(3) organization uses a local agent, it must immediately provide the local agent's name, address, and telephone number to the requester. The local agent must:     Be located within reasonable proximity to the principal, regional, or district office where the individual makes the request, and   Provide document copies within the same time frames as the 501(c)(3) organization.         Written requests for document copies. If a 501(c)(3) organization receives a written request for a copy of its annual returns (or parts of these documents), it must give a copy to the requester. However, this rule only applies if the request;     Is addressed to a 501(c)(3) organization's principal, regional, or district office;   Is delivered to that address by mail, electronic mail (email), facsimile (fax), or a private delivery service approved by the IRS (see Private Delivery Service, earlier, for a list), and   Gives the address to which the document copies should be sent.         How and when a written request is fulfilled.      Requested document copies must be mailed within 30 days from the date the 501(c)(3) organization receives the request.   Unless other evidence exists, a request or payment that is mailed is considered to be received by the 501(c)(3) organization 7 days after the postmark date.   If an advance payment is required, copies must be provided within 30 days from the date payment is received.   If the 501(c)(3) organization requires payment in advance and it receives a request without payment or with insufficient payment, it must notify the requester of the prepayment policy and the amount due within 7 days from the date it receives the request.   A request that is transmitted to the 501(c)(3) organization by email or fax is considered received the day the request is transmitted successfully.   Requested documents can be emailed instead of the traditional method of mailing if the requester consents to this method.      A document copy is considered as provided on the:     Postmark date,   Private delivery date,   Registration date for certified or registered mail,   Postmark date on the sender's receipt for certified or registered mail, or   Day the email is successfully transmitted (if the requester agreed to this method).          Requests for parts of a document copy. A person can request all or any specific part or schedule of the annual returns and the 501(c)(3) organization must fulfill their request for a copy.     Can an agent be used to provide copies? A 501(c)(3) organization can use an agent to provide document copies for the written requests it receives. However, the agent must provide the document copies under the same conditions that are imposed on the 501(c)(3) organization itself. Also, if an agent fails to provide the documents as required, the 501(c)(3) organization will continue to be subject to penalties.  Example. The ABC Organization retained an agent to provide copies for all written requests for documents. However, ABC Organization received a request for document copies before the agent did. The deadline for providing a response is referenced by the date that the ABC Organization received the request and not when the agent received it. If the agent received the request first, then a response would be referenced to the date that the agent received it.       Can a fee be charged for providing copies? A 501(c)(3) organization may charge a reasonable fee for providing copies. Also, it can require the fee to be paid before providing a copy of the requested document.    What is a reasonable fee? A fee is reasonable only if it is no more than the per-page copying fee charged by the IRS for providing copies, plus no more than the actual postage costs incurred to provide the copies.     What forms of payment must the 501(c)(3) organization accept? The form of payment depends on whether the request for copies is made in person or in writing. Cash and money order must be accepted for in-person requests for document copies. The 501(c)(3) organization, if it wishes, may accept additional forms of payment. Certified check, money order, and either personal check or credit card must be accepted for written requests for document copies. The 501(c)(3) organization, if it wishes, may accept additional forms of payment.     Other fee information. If a 501(c)(3) organization provides a requester with notice of a fee and the requester doesn’t pay the fee within 30 days, the 501(c)(3) organization may ignore the request. If a requester's check doesn’t clear on deposit, the 501(c)(3) organization may ignore the request. If a 501(c)(3) organization doesn’t require prepayment and the requester doesn’t prepay, the 501(c)(3) organization must receive consent from the requester if the copying and postage charge exceeds $20.    501(c)(3) organizations subject to a harassment campaign. If the IRS determines that a 501(c)(3) organization is being harassed, it isn't required to comply with any request for copies that it reasonably believes is part of the harassment campaign. A group of requests for a 501(c)(3) organization's annual return is indicative of a harassment campaign if the requests are part of a single coordinated effort to disrupt the operations of the 501(c)(3) organization rather than to collect information about it.   Requests that may be disregarded without IRS approval. A 501(c)(3) organization may disregard any request for copies of all or part of any document beyond the first two received within any 30-day period or the first four received within any 1-year period from the same individual or the same address.         Making the Annual Returns Widely Available    A 501(c)(3) organization doesn’t have to provide copies of its annual returns if it makes these documents widely available. However, it must still allow public inspection by office visitation.  How does a 501(c)(3) organization make its annual returns widely available? A 501(c)(3) organization's annual returns are widely available if it meets all four of the following requirements.     The Internet posting requirement is met if:    The document is posted on an Internet page that the 501(c)(3) organization establishes and maintains, or   The document is posted as part of a database of like documents of other tax-exempt organizations on an Internet page established and maintained by another entity.      An additional posting information requirement is met if:    The Internet page through which the document is available clearly informs readers that the document is available and provides instructions for downloading the document;   After it is downloaded and viewed, the web document exactly reproduces the image of the annual return as it was originally filed with the IRS, except for any information permitted by statute to be withheld from public disclosure; and   Any individual with access to the Internet can access, download, view, and print the document without special computer hardware or software required for that format (except software that is readily available to members of the public without payment of any fee) and without payment of a fee to the 501(c)(3) organization or to another entity maintaining the web page.      The reliability and accuracy requirements are met if the entity maintaining the Internet page:    Has procedures for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the document that it posts on the page;   Takes reasonable precautions to prevent alteration, destruction, or accidental loss of the document when posted on its page; and   Corrects or replaces the document if a posted document is altered, destroyed, or lost.      The notice requirement is met if a 501(c)(3) organization notifies any individual requesting a copy of its annual return where the documents are available (including the Internet address). If the request is made in person, the 501(c)(3) organization must notify the individual immediately. If the request is in writing, it must notify the individual within 7 days of receiving the request.              Penalties    A penalty may be imposed on any person who doesn’t make the annual returns (including all required attachments) available for public inspection according to the section 6104(d) rules discussed, earlier. If more than one person fails to comply, each person is jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the penalty. The penalty amount is $20 for each day during which a failure occurs. The maximum penalty that may be imposed on all persons for any one annual return is $10,000. Any person who willfully fails to comply with the section 6104(d) public inspection requirements is subject to an additional penalty of $5,000.        Specific Instructions      Period Covered File the 2019 form for calendar year 2019 or a fiscal year beginning in 2019 and ending in 2020. For a fiscal year, fill in the tax year information at the top of the form. The 2019 Form 990-T may also be used if:    The organization has a tax year of less than 12 months that begins and ends in 2020, and   The 2020 Form 990-T isn't available at the time the organization is required to file its return. The organization must show its 2020 tax year on the 2019 Form 990-T and take into account any tax law changes that are effective for tax years beginning after 2019.         Name and Address The name and address on Form 990-T should be the same as the name and address shown on other Forms 990. Include the suite, room, or other unit number after the street address. If the Post Office doesn’t deliver mail to the street address and the organization has a P.O. box, show the box number instead of the street address. If the organization receives its mail in care of a third party (such as an accountant or an attorney), enter on the street address line ""C/O"" followed by the third party's name and street address or P.O. box.     Change of name. If the organization has changed its name, it must check the box next to ""Name of organization"" and also provide the following when filing this return, if it is:    A corporation, or is incorporated with the state—an amendment to the articles of incorporation along with proof of filing with the state.   A trust—an amendment to the trust agreement with the trustee(s) signature.   An association, or an unincorporated association—an amendment to the articles of association, constitution, by-laws, or other organizing document with signatures of at least two officers/members.         Blocks A Through J  Block A. If the organization has changed its address since it last filed a return, check Block A.    If a change in address occurs after the return is filed, use Form 8822–B, Change of Address or Responsible Party - Business, to notify the IRS of the new address.   Block B. Check the box under which the organization receives its tax exemption. Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans should check the 501 box and enter ""a"" between the first set of parentheses. For other organizations exempt under section 501, check the box for 501 and enter the section that describes their tax exempt status, for example, 501(c)(3). For tax exempt organizations that don't receive their exemption under section 501, use the following guide.          IF you are a  THEN check this box    IRA, SEP, or SIMPLE 408(e)   Roth IRA 408A   Archer MSA 220(e)   Coverdell ESA 530(a)   Qualified State Tuition Program 529(a)       For an ""applicable reinsurance entity"" described in section 1341(c)(1) of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), don't check any of the boxes. Instead, write ""Applicable Reinsurance Entity"" across the top of the Form 990-T.   Block C. Enter the total of the end-of-year assets from the organization's books of account.   Block D. An employees' trust described in section 401(a) and exempt under section 501(a) should enter its own trust identification number in this block. An IRA trust enters its own EIN in this block. An IRA trust never uses a social security number or the trustee's EIN. An EIN may be applied for:    Online—Click on the Employer ID Numbers (EINs) link at  Apply for an EIN online. The EIN is issued immediately once the application information is validated.   By mailing or faxing Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number.         Note. Only organizations located in the United States or U.S. possessions can use the online application. Foreign organizations must use one of the other methods to apply for an EIN.      Block E. Enter the applicable unrelated trade or business activity code that specifically describes the organization's unrelated trade or business reported in Parts I and II. The business activity codes in these instructions (before the Index), except as otherwise noted, are non-exclusive list of 6-digit NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes that may be relied on as a reasonable, good-faith interpretation under Notice 2018-67, 2018-36 I.R.B. 409.    Block F. If the organization is covered by a group exemption, enter the group exemption number.   Block G. Check the box that describes your organization, unless you are an applicable reinsurance entity under section 1341(c)(1) of the ACA. ""Other trust"" includes IRAs, SEPs, SIMPLEs, Roth IRAs, Coverdell IRAs, and Archer MSAs. Section 529 organizations check the 501(c) corporation or 501(c) trust box depending on whether the organization is a corporation or a trust. Also, the box for 529(a) in Block B must be checked. If you check ""501(c) corporation,"" leave line 41 blank. If you check ""501(c) trust,"" ""401(a) trust,"" or ""Other trust"" leave line 40 blank. An applicable reinsurance entity should check none of the boxes.   Block H. Enter the total number of the organization's unrelated trades or businesses. An organization with only one unrelated trade or business describes the unrelated trade or business in Block H (attach a statement if more space is needed) and should complete Parts I, II, and III. An organization with more than one unrelated trade or business describes one unrelated trade or business in Block H (attach a statement if more space is needed) and should complete Parts I and II for that unrelated trade or business. The organization should then complete a separate Schedule M for each additional unrelated trade or business. After completing Parts I, II, and all needed Schedules M, the organization should then complete Part III.    Block I. Check the ""Yes,"" box if your organization is a corporation and either 1 or 2 below applies:     The corporation is a subsidiary in an affiliated group (defined in section 1504) but isn't filing a consolidated return for the tax year with that group.   The corporation is a subsidiary in a parent-subsidiary controlled group (defined in section 1563).         Excluded member. If the corporation is an ""excluded member"" of a controlled group (see section 1563(b)(2)), it is still considered a member of a controlled group for purposes of Block I.    Block J. Enter the name of the person who has the organization's books and records and the telephone number at which he or she can be reached.       Part I. Unrelated Trade or Business Income     Reporting One or More Than One Unrelated Trade or Business An organization with only one unrelated trade or business should complete Parts I, II, and III. Complete only the lines relevant to the unrelated trade or business being reported on Part I. An organization with more than one unrelated trade or business should complete Parts I and II for one trade or business, attach a separate Schedule M for each additional trade or business, then complete Part III. If filing one or more Schedules M, refer to the instructions for Parts I and II in completing the corresponding lines on Schedule M. Complete only the lines relevant to the unrelated trade or business being reported on Schedule M. Attach statements containing the information required by Schedules A through K to Schedule M as necessary. Filers may fill in blank copies of Schedules A through K for this purpose. Complete lines 1 through 13, column (A), of Form 990-T and any Schedules M. If the sum of the amount on Part I, line 13, of Form 990-T and any Schedules M is $10,000 or less, you may complete only line 13 for columns (B) and (C) on Form 990-T and any Schedules M. These filers don't have to complete Schedules A through K (however, refer to applicable schedules when completing lines 1 through 13, column (A) of Form 990-T, and any Schedules M). If the sum of the amount on line 13, column (A), of Form 990-T and any Schedules M is more than $10,000, complete all lines and schedules that apply. Attach copies of the appropriate schedules to Schedule M. Refer to the corresponding schedules to determine the amount to be reported on each line.   Member income of mutual or cooperative electric companies. Income of a mutual or cooperative electric company described in section 501(c)(12) which is treated as member income under subparagraph (H) of that section is excluded from unrelated business taxable income.   Income from qualifying shipping activities. The organization's gross income doesn’t include income from qualifying shipping activities (as defined in section 1356) if the organization makes an election under section 1354 on a timely filed return (including extensions) to be taxed on its notional shipping income (as defined in section 1353) at the highest corporate rate. If the election is made, the organization generally may not claim any loss, deduction, or credit with respect to qualifying shipping activities. An organization making this election also may elect to defer gain on the disposition of a qualifying vessel under section 1359. Use Form 8902, Alternative Tax on Qualifying Shipping Activities, to figure the tax. Include the alternative tax on Form 990-T, Part IV, line 48.   Passive loss and at-risk limitations. Under section 469, certain taxpayers, including certain tax-exempt organizations, may not deduct a passive activity loss (PAL). Such tax-exempt organizations (""affected tax-exempt organizations"") include a trust (such as a trust described in section 501(c), a trust described in section 401(a), or an IRA), and a corporation if at any time during the last half of its tax year more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for not more than five organizations that are private foundations under section 509(a) or are described in sections 401(a) or 501(c)(17) (for example, a stock corporation described in section 501(c)(2) with a 401(a) parent or private foundation parent).  A PAL occurs when total losses (including prior year unallowed losses) from all the organization’s passive activities exceed the total income from all its passive activities. Generally, passive activities include: (1) trade or business activities in which the organization didn’t materially participate for the tax year; and (2) rental activities, regardless of your participation. If the organization has income or loss from a passive activity, several lines on the Form 990-T may be affected by these rules.  PALs can’t be used to offset income from nonpassive activities. Passive activity income doesn’t include portfolio income. Portfolio income (see Temporary Regulations section 1.469-2T(c)(3)) is income from a nonpassive activity. Portfolio income includes all gross income, other than income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business, that is attributable to interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties (by contrast, a bank's receipt of interest is in the ordinary course of a trade or business, as is a securities dealer's receipt of dividends). Portfolio income also includes gain or loss from the disposition of property that produces portfolio income or is held for investment (see section 163(d)(5)). The rule treating portfolio income as not from a passive activity doesn’t apply to the extent that income, of a type generally regarded as portfolio income, is derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. For example, the business income of a bank typically is largely interest. Similarly, a securities broker/dealer may earn a substantial portion of the income from the business in the form of dividends and gains on sales of dividend-bearing instruments. Interest income may also arise in the ordinary course of a trade or business with respect to installment sales and interest charges on accounts receivable. This means that portfolio income may not be reduced by PALs or passive activity credits. For example, any portfolio income earned by a trust described in section 501(a) that is unrelated business taxable income (such as unrelated debt-financed income) may not be offset by PALs from an unrelated trade or business. Section 469(k) provides that the passive activity limitations must be applied separately to items from each publicly traded partnership (PTP). A PTP is a partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or its substantial equivalent). PALs from a PTP generally may be used only to offset income or gain from passive activities of the same PTP. This means that a partner in a PTP may not use PALs and passive activity credits from a PTP to offset income from other sources, including passive activity income from another PTP. Such PALs and passive activity credits aren't allowed for the taxable year. Generally, PALs are subject to other limitations (for example, basis and at-risk limitations) before they are subject to the PAL limitations. For example, the at-risk rules under section 465 generally prohibit trusts and corporations that are affected tax-exempt organizations from claiming losses from activities in excess of the taxpayer’s amount at risk in the activity.  An affected tax-exempt organization may need to attach Form 6198, At-Risk Limitations, and either Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations, or Form 8810, Corporate Passive Activity Loss and Credit Limitations. For more information on these rules, see Pub. 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.    How to report income received from a payment card and third party network transactions. An organization that receives a Form 1099-K reporting a ""gross amount"" received from payment card and third party network transactions in the tax year should report these amounts in the same manner as if the payments weren’t reported on a Form 1099-K. There isn't any one specific line on which to report an amount from Form 1099-K; the correct line should be determined based on the nature of the payments. Some payments received may constitute unrelated business income; see the instructions below to determine the appropriate line. For instance, if some of the payments are sales income from an unrelated business, then those payments would be reported on line 1a. Retain Forms 1099-K with your other records.      Line 1a. Gross Receipts or Sales Enter the gross receipts from an unrelated trade or business regularly conducted that involves the sale of goods or performance of services.    A section 501(c)(7) social club would report its restaurant and bar receipts from nonmembers on line 1, but would report its investment income on line 9 and in Schedule G.  Advance payments. In general, advance payments are reported in the year of receipt. To report income from long-term contracts, see section 460. For special rules for reporting certain advance payments for goods and long-term contracts, see Regulations section 1.451-5. For permissible methods for reporting advance payments for services and certain goods by an accrual method organization, see Rev. Proc. 2004-34, 2004-22 I.R.B. 991, available at IRS.gov/IRB2004-22.    Installment sales. Generally, the installment method cannot be used for dealer dispositions of property. A ""dealer disposition"" is (a) any disposition of personal property by a person who regularly sells or otherwise disposes of personal property of the same type on the installment plan or (b) any disposition of real property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.  These restrictions on using the installment method don't apply to dispositions of property used or produced in a farming business or sales of time-shares and residential lots for which the organization elects to pay interest under section 453(l)(3). For sales of time-shares and residential lots reported under the installment method, the organization's income tax is increased by the interest payable under section 453(l)(3). To report this addition to the tax, see the instructions for line 48. Enter on line 1a and line 3, the gross profit on collections from installment sales for any of the following.    Dealer dispositions of property before March 1, 1986.   Dispositions of property used or produced in the trade or business of farming.   Certain dispositions of time-shares and residential lots reported under the installment method.      Attach a statement showing the following information for the current and the 3 preceding years.    Gross sales,   Cost of goods sold,   Gross profits,   Percentage of gross profits to gross sales,   Amount collected, and    Gross profit on amount collected.        Nonaccrual experience method. Accrual method organizations aren't required to accrue certain amounts to be received from the performance of services that, on the basis of their experience, won't be collected, if:     The services are in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting; or    The organization's average annual gross receipts for the 3 prior tax years doesn’t exceed $5 million.       This provision doesn’t apply to any amount if interest is required to be paid on the amount or if there is any penalty for failure to timely pay the amount. See Regulations section 1.448-2. Organizations that qualify to use the nonaccrual experience method should attach a statement showing total gross receipts, amounts not accrued as a result of the application of section 448(d)(5), and the net amount accrued. Enter the net amount on line 1a.     Gain or loss on disposition of certain brownfield property. Gain or loss from the qualifying sale, exchange, or other disposition of a qualifying brownfield property (as defined in section 512(b)(19)(C)), which was acquired by the organization after 2004, is excluded from unrelated business taxable income and is excepted from the debt-financed rules for such property. See section 512(b)(19) and 514(b)(1)(E).      Line 4a. Capital Gain Net Income Generally, organizations required to file Form 990-T (except organizations described in sections 501(c)(7), (9), and (17)) aren't taxed on the net gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property. However, net capital gains on debt-financed property, capital gains on cutting timber, and ordinary gains on sections 1245, 1250, 1252, 1254, and 1255 property are taxed. See Form 4797, Sales of Business Property, and its instructions for additional information. Also, any capital gain or loss passed through from an S corporation or any gain or loss on the disposition of S corporation stock by a qualified tax exempt organization (see S Corporations, later) is taxed as a capital gain or loss, and reported on line 4. Capital gains and losses should be reported by a trust on Schedule D (Form 1041), Capital Gains and Losses, and by a corporation on Schedule D (Form 1120), Capital Gains and Losses (and Form 8949, Sale and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets). Schedule D of Form 1041 or Form 1120 (and Form 8949 if applicable) must be attached to Form 990-T. If you deferred a capital gain into a QOF, you must attach Schedule D, Form 8949, and Form 8997 to your return. You will need to annually file Form 8997 until you dispose of the investment. See the Instructions for Form 8997. An organization that transfers securities it owns for the contractual obligation of the borrower to return identical securities recognizes no gain or loss. To qualify for this treatment, the organization must lend the securities under an agreement that requires:    The return of identical securities;   The payment of amounts equivalent to the interest, dividends, and other distributions that the owner of the securities would normally receive; and   The risk of loss or opportunity for gain not be lessened.      See section 512(a)(5) for details.  Debt-financed property disposition. The amount of gain or loss to be reported on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of debt-financed property is the same percentage as the highest acquisition indebtedness for the property for the 12-month period before the date of disposition is to the average adjusted basis of the property. The percentage may not be more than 100%. See the instructions for Schedule E, column 5, to determine adjusted basis and average adjusted basis. If debt-financed property is depreciable or depletable property, the provisions of sections 1245, 1250, 1252, 1254, and 1255 must be considered first.  Example. On January 1, 2018, an exempt educational corporation, using $288,000 of borrowed funds, purchased an office building for $608,000. The only adjustment to basis was $29,902 for depreciation (straight line method under MACRS over the 39-year recovery period for nonresidential real property). The corporation (section 501(c)(3) organization) sold the building on December 31, 2019, for $640,000. At the date of sale, the adjusted basis of the building was $578,098 ($608,000 − $29,902) and the indebtedness remained at $288,000. The adjusted basis of the property on the first day of the year of disposition was $593,037. The average adjusted basis is $585,568 (($593,037 + $578,098) ÷ 2). The debt/basis percentage is 49% ($288,000 ÷ $585,568). The taxable gain is $30,332 (49% × ($640,000 − $578,098)). This is a long-term capital gain. A corporation should enter the gain on Schedule D (Form 1120) Part II, line 8. A trust should enter the gain on Schedule D (Form 1041), if applicable. In either scenario (a corporation or a trust), the educational organization must attach a statement to Form 990-T, in addition to the Schedule D attachment, showing how the gain was figured along the lines described in this example, if the details weren’t provided with the Schedule D attachment(s).      Disposition of property received from taxable subsidiary and used in unrelated business. A taxable 80%-owned subsidiary corporation of one or more tax-exempt entities is generally subject to tax on a distribution in liquidation of its assets to its exempt parent (or parents). See section 337. The assets are treated as if sold at FMV. ""Tax-exempt entities"" for this purpose include organizations described in sections 501(a), 529, 529A, and 115, charitable remainder trusts, U.S. and foreign governments; Indian tribal governments; international organizations; and similar non-taxable organizations. A taxable corporation that transfers substantially all of its assets to a tax-exempt entity in a transaction that otherwise qualifies for nonrecognition treatment must recognize gain on the transaction as if it sold the assets at FMV. However, such a transfer isn't taxable if it qualifies as a like-kind exchange under section 1031 or an involuntary conversion under section 1033. In such a case the built-in appreciation is preserved in the replacement property received in the transaction. A ""taxable corporation"" is any corporation that isn't a tax-exempt entity as defined above, including an S corporation.  A corporation that changes status from taxable to tax-exempt is treated generally as if it transferred all of its assets to a tax-exempt entity immediately before the change in status (thus subjecting it to the tax on a deemed sale for fair FMV). This rule doesn’t apply where the taxable corporation becomes exempt within 3 years of formation, or had previously been exempt and within several years (generally a period of 3 years) regains exemption, unless the principal purpose of the transactions is to avoid the tax on the change in status. In the transactions described above, the taxable event is deferred for property that the tax-exempt entity immediately uses in an unrelated business. If the parent later disposes of the property, then any gain (not in excess of the amount not recognized) is included in the parent’s unrelated business taxable income. If there is partial use of the assets in unrelated business, then there is partial recognition of gain or loss with respect to the assets not so used. Property is treated as disposed if the tax-exempt entity no longer uses it in an unrelated business. Losses on the transfer of assets to a tax-exempt entity are disallowed if part of a plan having a principal purpose of recognizing losses.      Line 4b. Net Gain or (Loss) Show gains and losses on other than capital assets on Form 4797. Enter on this line the net gain or (loss) from Form 4797, Part II, line 17. An exempt organization using Form 4797 to report ordinary gain on sections 1245, 1250, 1252, 1254, and 1255 property will include only depreciation, amortization, or depletion allowed or allowable in figuring unrelated business taxable income or taxable income of the organization (or a predecessor organization) for a period when it wasn’t exempt.     Line 4c. Capital Loss Deduction for Trusts If a trust has a net capital loss, it is subject to the limitations of Schedule D (Form 1041). Enter on this line the loss figured on Schedule D (Form 1041).     Line 5. Income or (Loss) From a Partnership or an S Corporation Refer to Notice 2018-67, 2018-36 I.R.B. 409 when reporting the organization's distributive share of partnership income (and partnership deductions directly connected with such income) from trades or businesses of a partnership that are unrelated trades or businesses with respect to the organization. Refer to Notice 2018-67, 2018-36 I.R.B. 409 for rules permitting the aggregation of income (and directly connected deductions) of certain partnership interests. Also, for trusts and certain corporations, there are limitations on income and losses (including from a partnership or an S corporation) under section 469 (the passive activity loss and credit limitation rules) and section 465 (at-risk limitations). For more information on these rules, see the discussion of the application of the passive loss and at-risk limitations to affected tax-exempt organizations in the introductory instructions to Part I. Unrelated Trade or Business Income, earlier.       Partnerships    If the organization is a partner in a partnership conducting an unrelated trade or business, enter the organization's share (whether or not distributed) of the partnership's income or loss from the unrelated trade or business. The organization is required to notify the partnership of its tax-exempt status. Figure the gross income and deductions of the partnership in the same way you figure unrelated trade or business income the organization earns directly. Attach a statement to this return showing the organization's share of the partnership's gross income from the unrelated trade or business, and its share of the partnership deductions directly connected with the unrelated gross income. Also, see  Attachments, earlier for other information you must include.        S Corporations    Qualified tax exempt organizations can be shareholders in an S corporation without the S corporation losing its status as an S corporation. Qualified tax exempt organizations that hold stock in an S corporation treat their stock interest as an interest in an unrelated trade or business. All items of income, loss, or deduction that the organization receives as a shareholder of the S corporation are taken into account in line 5 in figuring unrelated business taxable income and not reported on another line of Form 990-T that otherwise would apply, except capital gains and losses, which are reported on line 4. Report on line 4 any gain or loss on the disposition of S corporation stock.  Qualified tax exempts. A qualified tax exempt is an organization that is described in section 401(a) (qualified stock bonus, pension, and profit-sharing plans) or 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a).   Exception. Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) don't follow these S corporation rules if the S corporation stock is an employer security as defined in section 409(l). Attach a statement to this return showing the qualified tax exempt's share of all items of income, loss, or deduction. Combine the income, loss, and deductions (except for the capital gains and losses) on the statement. If you hold stock in more than one S corporation, total the combined amounts. Show capital gains and losses separately and include them on line 4a. Also, see  Attachments, earlier, for other information you must include.       Line 6. Rent income Report on line 6 rent income described in the instructions for Schedule C.     Line 7. Unrelated Debt-Financed Income Report on line 7 and Schedule E unrelated debt-financed income described in sections 512(b)(4) and 514 from debt-financed property only to the extent that the income doesn’t constitute income from the conduct of an unrelated trade or business and isn't specifically taxable under other provisions of the Code, such as taxable rents from personal property leased with real property reportable on line 6 and Schedule C, or taxable interest, annuities, royalties, and rents from a controlled entity reportable on line 8 and Schedule F. See Regulations section 1.514(b)-1(b)(2). Refer to Notice 2018-67, 2018-36 I.R.B. 409 when reporting income from one or more debt-financed properties and also for rules permitting the aggregation of unrelated debt-financed income with other UBTI in certain circumstances. Gain or loss from the sale or disposition of debt-financed property is reported on line 4 and not line 7 or Schedule E. Section 501(c)(7), (9), and (17) organizations should report income from debt-financed property on line 9 and Schedule G, not line 7 and Schedule E.      Line 8. Interest, Annuities, Royalties, and Rents from a Controlled Organization Report on line 8 and Schedule F interest, annuities, royalties, and rents (other than rents reportable on line 6 and Schedule C) from a controlled entity to the extent taxable under section 512(b)(13). See Regulations section 1.512(b)-1(l)(5).      Line 9. Investment Income of a Section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) Organization Report on line 9 and Schedule G all income of a section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) organization from investments in securities and other similar investment income from nonmembers, other than rent income (gross rents are reportable on line 6 and Schedule C). For these purposes, investment income includes all income from debt-financed property.     Line 12. Other Income Enter on line 12 any item of unrelated business income from a particular trade or business that isn't reportable elsewhere on the return. Include:    Recoveries of bad debts deducted in earlier years under the specific charge-off method. Attach a separate statement of any items of other income to your return;   The amount from Form 6478, Alcohol and Cellulosic Biofuel Fuels Credit (if applicable);   The amount from Form 8864, Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel Fuels Credit (if applicable); and   Proceeds received from employer- owned life insurance contracts issued after August 17, 2006. Complete Form 8925 and attach a copy to Form 990-T.       Excess business loss limitations for noncorporate taxpayers. Noncorporate taxpayers may be subject to the excess business loss limitations. If you are a noncorporate taxpayer with a loss attributable to your trade or business, see Form 461 and its instructions for details on the amount of excess business loss limitation. Write ""ELA"" and the amount from Form 461, line 16 as a positive number on the entry space for line 12. Include this amount in the total of all Other Income on line 12.   Organizations described in section 501(c)(19). Enter the net income from an insurance business that was not properly set aside. These organizations may set aside income from payments received for life, sickness, accident, or health insurance for members of the organization or their dependents.    To provide for the payment of insurance benefits.   For a purpose specified in section 170(c)(4) (religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, etc.).    For administrative costs directly connected with benefits described in 1 and 2 above.       Amounts set aside and used for purposes other than those in 1, 2, or 3 above must be included in unrelated business taxable income for the tax year if they were previously excluded from taxable income. Any amount spent for a purpose described in section 170(c)(4) is first considered paid from funds earned by the organization from insurance activities if the income isn't used for the insurance activities. Expenditures for lobbying aren't considered section 170(c)(4) expenses.  Income from property financed with qualified 501(c)(3) bonds. If any part of the property is used in a trade or business of any person other than a section 501(c)(3) organization or a governmental unit, and such use isn't consistent with the requirement for qualified 501(c)(3) bonds under section 145, the section 501(c)(3) organization is considered to have received unrelated business income in the amount of the greater of the actual rental income or the fair rental value of the property for the period it is used. No deduction is allowed for interest on the private activity bond. Report the greater of the actual rent or the fair rental value on line 12. Report allowable deductions in Part II. See sections 150(b)(3) and (c).   Passive foreign investment company (PFIC) shareholders. If the organization is a direct or indirect shareholder of a PFIC within the meaning of section 1297, it may have income tax consequences under section 1291 upon the disposition of the PFIC stock or on the receipt of an excess distribution from the PFIC, described in section 1291(a). The organization may have current income under section 1293 if the PFIC is a qualified electing fund (QEF) with respect to the organization. The organization may also have current income under section 1296 if it makes a section 1296 mark-to-market election with respect to the PFIC stock.   Include on line 12 the portion of an excess distribution (or gain treated as an excess distribution) section 1293 inclusion or section 1296 inclusion that is taxable as unrelated business taxable income. See Form 8621, Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund. See the instructions for Part III, lines 40 and 41, for reporting the deferred tax amount that may be owed by the organization with respect to an excess distribution (or gain treated as an excess distribution).  Treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to participation exemption system of taxation. If the organization has a section 965(a) inclusion for the tax year, enter the net amount (the section 965(a) inclusion less the corresponding section 965(c) deduction) on line 12. You must also complete and attach Form 965, Inclusion of Deferred Foreign Income Upon Transition to Participation Exemption System and applicable schedules and Form 965-A (trusts) or Form 965-B (corporations).       Part II. Deductions Not Taken Elsewhere If the sum of the amount on Part I, line 13, column (A), of Form 990-T and any Schedules M is $10,000 or less, you don't have to complete lines 14 through 27 of Part II of Form 990-T and any Schedules M. However, you must complete the remainder of Part II of Form 990-T and Schedules M and Part III of Form 990-T.  Note. Only expenses directly connected with the unrelated trade or business income of the particular trade or business being reported in Part I of Form 990-T or Schedule M (as applicable) may be deducted on these lines (see Directly connected expenses, earlier). Don't separately include in Part II any expenses that are reported in Schedules A through J, other than excess exempt expenses entered on line 25 and excess readership costs entered on line 26. For example, officers' compensation allocable to advertising income is reported on Schedule J only, and shouldn’t be included on Schedule K or Part II, line 14.     Limitations on Deductions The following items discuss certain areas in which the deduction may to some extent be limited.       Activities Lacking a Profit Motive    In some instances it is necessary to report income whether or not it comes from a trade or business (including interest, annuities, royalties, and rents from controlled organizations, and income of a section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) organization other than exempt function income). If income is attributable to an activity lacking a profit motive, then a net loss from the activity can’t be claimed on Form 990-T. Therefore, in Part I, column (B) and Part II, the total of deductions for expenses directly connected with income from an activity lacking a profit motive is limited to the amount of that income. Generally, an activity lacking a profit motive is one that isn't conducted for the purpose of producing a profit or one that has consistently produced losses when both direct and indirect expenses are taken into account.        Deductions Related to Property Leased to Tax-Exempt Entities    For property leased to a governmental or other tax-exempt entity, or in the case of property acquired after March 12, 2004, that is treated as tax-exempt use property other than by reason of a lease, the organization may not claim deductions related to the property when they exceed the organization's income from the lease payments. Amounts disallowed may be carried over to the next year and treated as a deduction concerning the property. See section 470.        Transactions Between Related Taxpayers    Generally, an accrual basis taxpayer may only deduct business expenses and interest owed to a related party in the year the payment is included in the income of the related party. See sections 163(e)(3) and 267 for limitations on deductions for unpaid interest and expenses.        Preference Items    Corporations may be required to adjust deductions for depletion of iron ore and coal, intangible drilling and exploration and development costs, and the amortizable basis of pollution control facilities. See section 291 to determine the amount of the adjustment.        Section 263A Uniform Capitalization Rules    These rules require organizations to capitalize or include as inventory cost certain costs incurred in connection with:    The production of real property and tangible personal property held in inventory or held for sale in the ordinary course of business.   Real property or personal property held in inventory (tangible and intangible) acquired for resale.   The production of real property and tangible personal property produced by the organization for use in its trade or business or in an activity engaged in for profit.      Tangible personal property produced by an organization includes a film, sound recording, videotape, book, or similar property.  Indirect expenses. Organizations subject to the section 263A uniform capitalization rules are required to capitalize direct costs and an allocable part of most indirect costs (including taxes) that benefit the assets produced or acquired for resale or are incurred by reason of the performance of production or resale activities. For inventory, some of the indirect expenses that must be capitalized are:     Administration expenses;   Taxes;   Depreciation;   Insurance;   Compensation paid to officers attributable to services;   Rework labor; and   Contributions to pension, stock bonus, and certain profit-sharing, annuity, or deferred compensation plans.      Regulations section 1.263A-1(e)(3) specifies other indirect costs that relate to production or resale activities that must be capitalized and those that may be currently deductible.   Interest expense. Interest expense paid or incurred during the production period of designated property must be capitalized and is governed by special rules. See Regulations section 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15.   When are section 263A capitalized costs deductible? The costs required to be capitalized under section 263A aren't deductible until the property (to which the costs relate) is sold, used, or otherwise disposed of by the organization.   Exceptions. Section 263A doesn’t apply to:     Personal property acquired for resale if the organization's average annual gross receipts for the 3 prior tax years were $10 million or less;   Timber;   Most property produced under long-term contract;   Certain property produced in a farming business;   Research and experimental costs under section 174;   Geological and geophysical costs amortized under section 167(h);   Intangible drilling costs for oil, gas, and geothermal property;   Mining exploration and development costs; and   Inventory of an organization that accounts for inventories in the same manner as materials and supplies that aren't incidental. See Schedule A. Cost of Goods Sold, later.    See Regulations sections 1.263A-1 through 1.263A-3.         Travel, Meals, and Entertainment    Subject to limitations and restrictions discussed below, an organization can deduct ordinary and necessary travel, meals, and non-entertainment expenses paid or incurred in its trade or business. Generally, entertainment expenses, membership dues, and facilities used in connection with these activities cannot be deducted. In addition, no deduction is generally allowed for qualified transportation fringe benefits. Special rules apply to deductions for gifts, luxury water travel, and convention expenses. See section 274 and Pub. 463.    Qualified transportation fringes (QTFs). Generally, no deduction is allowed under section 274(a)(4) for QTF's provided by employers to their employees. QTFs are defined in section 132(f)(1) and include:    Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle between the employee's residence and place of employment,   Any transit pass, and   Qualified parking.      See section 274, Pub 15-B, and Pub. 535 for details.   Travel. The organization can’t deduct travel expenses of any individual accompanying an organization's officer or employee, including a spouse or dependent of the officer or employee, unless:     That individual is an employee of the organization, and   His or her travel is for a bona fide business purpose and would otherwise be deductible by that individual.        Meals. Generally, the organization can deduct only 50% of the amount otherwise allowable for meal expenses paid or incurred in an unrelated trade or business. Meals not separately stated from entertainment are generally not deductible. In addition (subject to exceptions under section 274(k)(2)):     Meals mustn’t be lavish or extravagant; and    An employee of the organization must be present at the meal.        Membership dues. The organization can deduct amounts paid or incurred for membership dues in civic or public service organizations, professional organizations (such as bar and medical associations), business leagues, trade associations, chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and real estate boards. However, no deduction is allowed if a principal purpose of the organization is to entertain or provide entertainment facilities for members or their guests. In addition, organizations cannot deduct membership dues in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose. This includes country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, airline and hotel clubs, and clubs operated to provide meals under conditions favorable to business discussion.   Entertainment facilities. The organization can’t deduct an expense paid or incurred for use of a facility (such as a yacht or hunting lodge) for an activity usually considered entertainment, amusement, or recreation.     Amounts treated as compensation. The organization generally may be able to deduct otherwise nondeductible travel, meals, and entertainment expenses if the amounts are treated as compensation and reported on Form W-2 for an employee or Form 1099-MISC for an independent contractor and if the total amount of such compensation isn't unreasonable.         Reducing Certain Expenses For Which Credits Are Allowable    If the organization claims certain credits, it may need to reduce the otherwise allowable deductions for expenses used to figure the credit. This applies to credits such as the following.    Disabled access credit.   Employer credit for social security and Medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips.   Credit for employer-provided childcare facilities and services.   Orphan drug credit.   Credit for small employer pension plan start-up costs.   Mine rescue team training credit.   Employer credit for paid family and medical leave.      If the organization has any of these credits, figure each current year credit before figuring the deduction for expenses on which the credit is based.        Business Start-up and Organizational Costs    For business start-up and organizational costs paid or incurred after September 8, 2008, an organization can deduct up to $5,000 of such costs in the year it begins business (unless the organization elects to capitalize the full amount of such costs). The $5,000 deduction is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount the total costs exceed $50,000. If the total costs are $55,000 or more, the deduction is reduced to zero. Any costs not deducted must be amortized as explained below.  Note. For start-up and organizational costs paid or incurred after September 8, 2008, the organization isn't required to attach a statement or specifically identify the amount deducted for the election under sections 195(b) and 248(a) to be effective. It is a deemed election. Whether an organization deducts a portion of its start-up and organizational costs under Regulations sections 1.195-1 and 1.248-1 or elects to amortize the full amount of such costs, its election is irrevocable. For start-up and organizational costs paid or incurred after October 22, 2004, and before September 9, 2008, an organization generally must attach the statement required by Regulation sections 1.195-1(b) and 1.248-1(c) to make the election to deduct a portion of such costs (as explained above). This election is irrevocable. However, an organization can apply the provisions of these regulations to costs paid or incurred after October 22, 2004.   Amortization. Any costs not deducted under the above rules must be amortized ratably over the 180-month period, beginning with the month the organization begins business. See the Instructions for Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, for details. If the association elected to amortize business start-up and organizational costs paid or incurred before October 23, 2004, over a period of 60 months or more, it must continue to amortize those costs over the elected amortization period. Report the deductible amount of these costs and any amortization on line 27. For amortization that began during the tax year, complete and attach Form 4562.       Line 16. Repairs and Maintenance Enter the cost of incidental repairs and maintenance not claimed elsewhere on the return, such as labor and supplies, that don't add to the value or appreciably prolong the life of the property.     Line 17. Bad Debts Enter the total receivables from an unrelated trade or business that were previously included in taxable income and that became worthless in whole or in part during the tax year.     Line 18. Interest Attach a separate statement listing the interest being claimed on this line.      Interest allocation. If the proceeds of a loan were used for more than one purpose (for example, to purchase a portfolio investment and to acquire an interest in a passive activity), an interest allocation must be made. See Temp. Reg. section 1.163-8T for the interest allocation rules.   Tax-exempt interest. Don't include interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations on which the interest income is totally exempt from income tax. For exceptions, see section 265(b).   Prepaid interest. Generally, a cash basis taxpayer cannot deduct prepaid interest allocable to years following the current tax year. For example, during the tax year a cash basis taxpayer prepaid interest on a loan. The taxpayer can deduct only that part of the prepaid interest that was for the use of the loaned funds during the tax year, not for the use of the loaned funds during the subsequent years.   Straddle interest. Generally, the interest and carrying charges on straddles cannot be deducted and must be capitalized. See section 263(g).   Original issue discount. See section 163(e)(5) for special rules for the disqualified portion of original issue discount on a high yield discount obligation.   Interest on certain underpayments of tax. Don't deduct interest paid or incurred on any portion of an underpayment of tax that is attributable to an understatement arising from an undisclosed listed transaction or an undisclosed reportable avoidance transaction (other than a listed transaction) entered into in tax years beginning after October 22, 2004.   Interest allocable to the production of designated property. Don't deduct interest on debt allocable to the production of designated property. Interest that is allocable to such property produced by an organization for its own use or for sale must be capitalized. An organization must also capitalize any interest on debt allocable to an asset used to produce the earlier property. See section 263A(f) and Regulations sections 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15.   Interest on below-market loans. See section 7872 for special rules regarding the deductibility of foregone interest on certain below-market-rate loans.   Limitation on deduction of business interest. Business interest expense is limited to the sum of business interest income, 30% of the adjusted taxable income and floor plan financing interest. Business interest expense includes any interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to an unrelated trade or business. A taxpayer, other than a tax shelter, that meets the gross receipts test is not required to limit business interest expense under section 163(j). A taxpayer meets the gross receipts test if the taxpayer has average annual gross receipts that are taken into account in determining its unrelated business taxable income of $26 million or less for the three prior tax years. Gross receipts include the aggregate gross receipts from all persons treated as a single employer such as a controlled group of corporations, commonly controlled partnerships or proprietorships, and affiliated service groups. If the taxpayer fails to meet the gross receipts test, Form 8990 is generally required.          Line 19. Taxes and Licenses Enter taxes and license fees paid or accrued during the year, but don't include the following taxes.    Federal income taxes.   Foreign or U.S. possession income taxes if a foreign tax credit is claimed.   Taxes not imposed on your organization.   Taxes, including state or local sales taxes, paid or incurred in connection with an acquisition or disposition of property. These taxes must be treated as part of the cost of the acquired property or, in the case of a disposition, as a reduction in the amount realized on the disposition.   Taxes assessed against local benefits that increase the value of the property assessed (such as for paving, etc.).   Taxes deducted elsewhere on the return, such as those reflected in cost of goods sold.      See section 164(d) for apportionment of taxes on real property between the buyer and seller.     Line 20. Depreciation Besides depreciation, include on line 20 the part of the cost, under section 179, that the organization elected to expense for certain tangible property placed in service during the tax year or carried over from the prior tax year. See Form 4562 and its instructions.     Line 22. Depletion See sections 613 and 613A for percentage depletion rates for natural deposits. Attach Form T, Forest Activities Schedules, if a deduction is taken for depletion of timber.     Line 23. Contributions to Deferred Compensation Plans Employers who maintain pension, profit-sharing, or other funded deferred compensation plans are generally required to file Form 5500. This requirement applies whether or not the plan is qualified under the Code and whether or not a deduction is claimed for the current tax year. Section 6652(e) imposes a penalty for late filing of these forms. In addition, there is a penalty for overstating the pension plan deduction. See section 6662(f).     Line 24. Employee Benefit Programs Enter the amount of contributions to employee benefit programs (such as insurance, health, and welfare programs) that aren't an incidental part of a deferred compensation plan included on line 23.     Line 27. Other Deductions Enter on this line the deduction taken for amortization (see Form 4562) as well as other authorized deductions for which no space is provided on the return. Attach a separate statement listing the deductions claimed on this line. Deduct only items directly connected with the unrelated trade or business for which income is reported in Part I or Schedule M.  Extraterritorial income exclusion. Complete Form 8873 and enter the deduction from line 53, on this line. Don't deduct fines or penalties paid to a government for violating any law. The exclusion was repealed generally for transactions after 2004, with some exceptions. See Form 8873 and its instructions.      Line 30. Net Operating Loss (NOL) Deduction Arising in Tax Years Beginning On or After January 1, 2018 The NOL deduction is the net operating loss carryover and carrybacks that can be deducted in the tax year with regard to each separate trade or business. To be deductible, a NOL must have been incurred in an unrelated trade or business activity. See section 172(a). P.L. 115-97 eliminated the option for most taxpayers to carry back a net operating loss (NOL). For most taxpayers, NOLs arising from tax years ending after 2017 can carry the NOL only to a subsequent year. The 2-year carryback rule does not apply to NOL’s arising in tax years ending after 2017. Exceptions apply to certain farming losses and NOLs of insurance companies other than life insurance companies. See section 172(b), as amended by P.L. 115-97, section 13302. See Publication 225, Farmer's Tax Guide, Publication 536, Net Operating Losses, or Publication 542, Corporations, for additional information. Noncorporate taxpayers may be subject to the excess business loss limitations. If you are a noncorporate taxpayer with a loss attributable to your trade or business, see Form 461 and instructions for details on the amount of excess business loss limitation. Enter on line 30 the NOL carryover from other tax years attributable to that trade or business, but don't enter more than the amount shown on line 29. An organization that claims the deduction with respect to any NOL carried through tax years for which the organization was not required to file Form 990-T must show the amount of the deduction and how it was computed, but the organization need not file a Form 990-T in order to preserve a NOL carryover. The amount of a NOL carryback or carryover is determined under section 172. See Regulations section 1.512(b)-1(e). Attach a statement showing the computation of the NOL deduction. An organization eligible to carry a NOL back to a prior year must file an amended Form 990-T for that year. Form 1045 or 1139 can’t be used for this purpose, though it may be attached to the amended Form 990-T to show the NOL computation. See Pub. 536, Net Operating Losses for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts.      Part III. Total Unrelated Business Taxable Income    Line 32. Total of Unrelated Business Taxable Income Computed From All Unrelated Trades or Businesses An organization with only one unrelated trade or business should enter the amount from line 31. An organization with more than one unrelated trades or businesses should enter the sum of the amounts from lines 31 of Form 990-T and all Schedules M. For an organization with more than one unrelated trades or businesses, if line 31 from Form 990-T or any Schedule M is less than zero, do not include the amount in calculating the sum reported on line 32.     Line 33. Amounts Paid for Disallowed Fringes Do not enter any amount on this line. The provision was retroactively repealed in P.L. 116-94.     Line 34. Charitable Contributions Enter contributions or gifts actually paid within the tax year to or for the use of charitable and governmental organizations described in section 170(c). Also, enter any unused contributions carried over from earlier years. The deduction for contributions will be allowed whether or not directly connected with the conduct of a trade or business.  Corporations. The total amount claimed normally can’t be more than 10% of unrelated business taxable income figured without regard to the following.     Any deduction for contributions.   Any capital loss carryback to the tax year under section 1212(a)(1).      Corporations on the accrual basis can elect to deduct contributions paid by the 15th day of the 4th month after the end of the tax year if the contributions are authorized by the board of directors during the tax year. Attach a declaration statement to the return stating that the resolution authorizing the contributions was adopted by the board of directors during the tax year. The declaration statement must also include the date the resolution was adopted. See Regulations section 1.170A-11.    Temporary suspension of 10% limitation for certain disaster-related contributions. A corporation may elect to deduct qualified cash contributions without regard to the 10% taxable income limit. Qualified contributions are any charitable contributions that were made after December 31, 2017, and before February 19, 2020, to a qualified charitable organization (other than certain private foundations described in section 509(a)(3) or donor advised funds described in section 4966(d)(2)) for relief efforts in one or more qualified disaster areas. The corporation must obtain contemporaneous written acknowledgment (within the meaning of section 170(f)(8)) from the qualified charitable organization that the contribution was used or is to be used for disaster relief efforts. The total amount of the contribution claimed for disaster relief efforts cannot exceed 100% of the excess of the corporation's taxable income (as computed above substituting “100%” for “10%” ) over all other allowable charitable contributions. Any excess qualified contributions are carried over to the next 5 years.      Suspension of 10% limitation for farmers and ranchers. An organization that is a qualified farmer or rancher (as defined in section 170(b)(1)(E)) that doesn’t have publicly traded stock can deduct contributions of qualified conservation property without regard to the general 10% limit. The total amount of the contribution claimed for the qualified conservation property can’t exceed ""100%"" of the excess of the organization's taxable income (as computed above substituting ""100%"" for ""10%"" over all other allowable charitable contributions). Any excess qualified conservation contributions can be carried over the next 15 years subject to the 100% limitation. See section 170(b)(2)(B). Contributions of conservation property made after August 17, 2006, that is used in agriculture or livestock production must remain available for such productions.     Carryover. Charitable contributions over the 10% limitation can’t be deducted for the tax year, but may be carried over to the next 5 tax years. In figuring the charitable contributions deduction, if the corporation has a NOL carryover to the tax year, the 10% limit is applied using the taxable income after taking into account any deduction for the NOL. To figure the amount of any remaining NOL carryover to later years, taxable income must be modified. See section 172(b). To the extent charitable contributions are used to reduce taxable income for this purpose and increase a net operating loss carryover, a contributions carryover isn't allowed. See section 170(d)(2)(B).    Trusts. In general:     For contributions to organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A), the amount claimed may not be more than 50% of the unrelated business taxable income figured without this deduction; and   For contributions to other organizations, the amount claimed may not be more than the smaller of:    30% of unrelated business taxable income figured without this deduction; or   The amount by which 50% of the unrelated business taxable income is more than the contributions allowed in 1 above.         An increased limitation may be available for cash contributions under section 170(b)(1)(G).     Contributions not allowable in whole or in part because of the limitations may not be deducted as a business expense but may be carried over to the next 5 tax years.  Substantiation requirements. Generally, no deduction is allowed for any contribution of $250 or more, unless the organization gets a written acknowledgment from the donee organization that shows the amount of cash contributed, describes any property contributed, and either gives a description and a good faith estimate of the value of any goods or services provided in return for the contribution or states that no goods or services were provided in return for the contribution. The acknowledgment must be obtained by the due date (including extension) of the organization's return, or, if earlier, the date the return is filed. However, see section 170(f)(8) and the related regulations for exceptions to this rule. Don't attach the acknowledgment to the return but keep it with the organization's records.  Note. For contributions of cash, check, or other monetary gifts (regardless of the amount), the organization must maintain a bank record, or a receipt, letter, or other written communication from the donee organization indicating the name of the organization, the date of the contribution, and the amount of the contribution.       Contributions of property other than cash. If an organization contributes property other than cash and claims over a $500 deduction for the property, it must attach a statement to the return describing the kind of property contributed and the method used to determine its fair market value (FMV). All organizations generally must complete and attach Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions, to their returns for contributions or property (other than money) if the total claimed deduction for all property contributed was more than $5,000. Special rules apply to the contribution of certain property. See the Instructions for Form 8283. A donee organization must use Form 8282, Donee Information Return, to report information to the IRS and donors about dispositions of certain charitable deduction property made within 3 years after the donor contributed the property. See the Instructions for Form 8282.    Special rules for contributions of certain easements in registered historic districts. The following rules apply to certain contributions of real property interests located in a registered historic district.    A deduction is allowed for the qualified real property interest, if the exterior of the building (including the front, side, rear, and space above the building) is preserved and no portion of the exterior is changed in a manner that is inconsistent with its historical character. See section 170(h)(4)(B).   A deduction is allowed on the building only (no deduction is allowed for a structure or land) if located in a registered historic district. However, if listed in the National Register, a deduction is also allowed for structures or land areas. See section 170(h)(4)(C).   The organization must also include the following information with the tax return.    A qualified appraisal (as defined in section 170(f)(11)(E)) of the qualified property interest,   Photographs of the entire exterior of the building, and    A description of all restrictions on the development of the building. See section 170(h)(4)(B)(iii).      The organization's deduction may be reduced if rehabilitation credits were claimed on the building. See section 170(f)(14).   A $500 filing fee may apply to certain deductions over $10,000. See section 170(f)(13).        Reduced deductions for contributions for certain property. The organization must reduce its deduction for contributions of certain capital gain property and qualified appreciated stock. See sections 170(e)(1) and 170(e)(5).   Special rules for corporation. A larger deduction is allowed for certain contributions of:    Inventory and other property to certain organizations for use in the care of the ill, needy, or infants (including contributions of apparently wholesome food (see section 170(e)(3)(C); and   Scientific equipment used for research to institutions of higher learning or to certain scientific research organizations (see section 170(e)(4)).      See section 170, the related regulations, and Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions.      Line 36. Deduction for Net Operating Loss Arising in Tax Years Beginning Before January 1, 2018 Enter the lesser of (a) the amount of net operating losses arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, or (b) the amount shown on line 32.     Line 38. Specific Deduction A specific deduction of $1,000 is allowed except for computing the net operating loss and the net operating loss deduction under section 172. Only one specific deduction may be taken, regardless of the number of unrelated businesses conducted. However, a diocese, province of a religious order, or convention or association of churches is allowed one specific deduction for each parish, individual church, district, or other local unit that regularly conducts an unrelated trade or business. This applies only to those parishes, districts, or other local units that aren't separate legal entities, but are components of a larger entity (diocese, province, convention, or association). Each specific deduction will be the smaller of $1,000 or the gross income from any unrelated trade or business the local unit conducts. If you claim a total specific deduction larger than $1,000, attach a statement showing how you figured the amount. The diocese, province of a religious order, or convention or association of churches must file a return reporting the gross income and deductions of all its units that aren't separate legal entities. These local units can’t file separate returns because they aren't separately incorporated. Local units that are separately incorporated must file their own returns and can’t be included with any other entity except for a title holding company. See Consolidated Returns, earlier. For details on the specific deduction, see section 512(b)(12) and the related regulations.  For Trust filers only. If you are a trust filing Form 990-T and have unrelated business income, you may have Qualified Business Income (QBI) and may be allowed a QBI deduction under section 199A.  Refer to the Instructions for Form 8995, Qualified Business Income Deduction Simplified Computation, or Form 8995-A, Qualified Business Income Deduction, (as applicable) to determine whether you meet the requirements for the QBI deduction and how to complete the applicable form. For purposes of calculating the QBI deduction, the taxable income before the QBI deduction is the amount reported on line 37, Total of unrelated business taxable income before specific deduction, less the specific deduction permitted under section 512(b)(12).  Note. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the organization determines the unrelated business income separately for each unrelated trade or business, and the income for an unrelated trade or business cannot be less than zero. Since a loss from an unrelated trade or business is not included in the unrelated business taxable income for the tax year due to application of section 512(a)(6), when calculating QBI, omit items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from any unrelated trade or business that operated at a loss. A loss from an unrelated trade or business will be carried forward to future years when the trust has income (or gain that is subject to unrelated business income tax) from the same unrelated trade or business and will be used in those years in calculating the QBI. Additionally, W-2 wages and unadjusted basis immediately after the acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property from an unrelated trade or business that operated at a loss for the current tax year are not used in calculating the limitation on QBI for taxpayers over the threshold.      Where to report the QBI deduction. Add the QBI deduction to any specific deduction allowable and report the total of these two amounts on line 38, Specific deduction. Attach a statement to the return identifying the amount of the QBI deduction claimed on line 38.        Part IV. Tax Computation    Line 40. Organizations Taxable as Corporations. Multiply line 39 by 21% (0.21).     Lines 40 and 41  Deferred tax amount under section 1291. If your organization has an excess distribution from a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) that is taxable as unrelated business taxable income, the organization may owe the deferred tax amount defined in section 1291(c)(1). The portion of the deferred tax amount that is the aggregate increases in taxes (described in section 1291(c)(2)) must be included in the amount entered on lines 40 or 41. Write to the left of lines 40 or 41, ""Sec. 1291"" and the amount.  Don't include on lines 40 or 41 the portion of the deferred tax amount that is the aggregate amount of interest determined under section 1291(c)(3). Instead, write ""Sec. 1291 interest"" and the amount in the bottom right margin of Form 990-T, page 2. See Part V of Form 8621.      Line 41. Trusts Trusts exempt under section 501(a), which otherwise would be subject to subchapter J (estates, trusts, etc.), are taxed at trust rates. This rule also applies to employees' trusts that qualify under section 401(a). Most trusts figure the tax on the unrelated business taxable income amount on line 39 using the Tax Rate Schedule for Trusts, below. If the tax rate schedule is used, enter the tax on line 41 and check the ""Tax rate schedule"" box on line 41. If the trust is eligible for the rates on net capital gains and qualified dividends, complete Schedule D (Form 1041) and enter on line 41 the tax from Schedule D (Form 1041). Check the ""Schedule D"" box on line 41 and attach Schedule D (Form 1041) to Form 990-T.    Tax Rate Schedule for Trusts            If the amount on line 41, is:     Over— But not over— Tax is: Of the amount over—   $0 $2,600 10% $0   2,600 9,300 $260.00 + 24% 2,600   9,300 12,750 1,868.00 + 35% 9,300   12,750 - - - - - 3,075.50 + 37% 12,750                      Line 42. Proxy Tax To pay the section 6033(e)(2) proxy tax on nondeductible lobbying and political expenditures, enter the proxy tax on line 42 and attach a statement showing the computation. Exempt organizations, except section 501(c)(3) and certain other organizations, must include certain information regarding lobbying expenditures on Form 990. In addition, organizations may have to provide notices to members regarding their share of dues to which the expenditures are allocable. See the Instructions for Form 990 and Rev. Proc. 98-19, 1998-1 C.B. 547, for exceptions. If the organization elects not to provide the notices described earlier, it must pay the proxy tax described in section 6033(e)(2). If the organization doesn’t include the entire amount of allocable dues in the notices, it may have to pay the proxy tax. This tax isn't applicable to section 501(c)(3) organizations. Figure the proxy tax by multiplying the aggregate amount not included in the notices described earlier by 21%. No deductions are allowed.     Line 43. Alternative Minimum Tax (Trusts Only) Only trusts liable for tax on unrelated business taxable income may be liable for alternative minimum tax on certain adjustments and tax preference items. Trusts attach Schedule I (Form 1041), Alternative Minimum Tax—Estates and Trusts, and enter any tax from Schedule I on this line.     Line 44. Tax on Non Compliant Facility Income There is a tax on a hospital organization’s non-compliant facility income. See Regulations section 1.501(r)-2 for more information. This tax is an income tax and is separate from the excise tax on a failure to meet the community health needs assessment requirements of section 501(r)(3) that is reported on Form 4720.     Line 45. Total Add lines 42, 43, and 44 to line 40 or 41, whichever applies.  Increase in tax attributable to partner's audit liability.

General Business Credit Enter on line 46c the organization's total general business credit (excluding the work opportunity credit, employee retention credit, the empowerment zone employment credit, the Indian employment credit, and the credit for employer differential wage payments). Additionally, in some cases, certain general business credits should not be claimed if the seller of the property discloses to the organization that the seller intends to claim the credit and discloses the tentative amount of the credit. These include the qualified electric vehicle credit, the alternative motor vehicle credit, the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, and the qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle credit. The organization is required to file Form 3800, General Business Credit, to claim any business credit. For a list of credits, see Form 3800. Include the allowable credit from Form 3800, Part II, line 38, on Form 990-T, line 46c.    An organization described in section 501(c) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) should not use Form 3800 to claim the refundable small employer tax credit for certain health insurance premiums paid on behalf of its employees. See the instructions for line 51f.     Line 46d. Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax Use Form 8801 to figure the minimum tax credit and any carryforwards of that credit for trusts. For corporations, use Form 8827.     Line 46e. Total credits. Add lines 46a through 46d.  Decrease in tax attributable to partner's audit liability. If your organization received Form 8986 from one or more partnerships that have elected to push out adjustments to partnership-related items to their partners, complete and attach Form 8978. See the Instructions for Form 8978. Include any decrease in taxes due from Form 8978, line 14, in the total for line 46e.

If property is disposed of or ceases to be qualified property, before the end of the recapture period or the useful life applicable to the property, there may be a recapture of the credit. See Form 4255, Recapture of Investment Credit.   Recapture of low-income housing credit. If the organization disposed of property (or there was a reduction in the qualified basis of the property) for which it took the low-income housing credit, it may owe a tax. See Form 8611, Recapture of Low-Income Housing Credit, and section 42(j) for details.   Interest due under the look-back method. If the organization used the look-back method for certain long-term contracts, see Form 8697 for information on figuring the interest the organization may have to include. The organization may also have to include interest due under the look-back method for property depreciated under the income forecast method. See Form 8866, Interest Computation Under the Look-Back Method for Property Depreciated Under the Income Forecast Method.   Other. Additional taxes and interest amounts may be included in the total entered on line 48. Check the box for ""Other"" if the organization includes any of the taxes and interest discussed. See How to report, below, for details on reporting these amounts on an attached statement.    Use this line to report the base erosion minimum tax under section 59A. Section 59A applies to base erosion payments paid or accrued in tax years beginning after 2017. See the Form 8991 instructions to determine if the organization qualifies as an applicable taxpayer under section 59A(e), in which case the base erosion minimum tax will need to be computed and entered on line 48.   Tax and interest on a nonqualified withdrawal from a capital construction fund (section 7518).   Interest on deferred tax attributable to (a) installment sales of certain time-shares and residential lots (section 453(l)(3)) and (b) certain nondealer installment obligations (section 453A(c)).   Interest due on deferred gain (section 1260(b)).   If the organization makes the election to be taxed on its income from qualifying shipping activities, complete and attach Form 8902 to Form 990-T. See Income from qualifying shipping activities, earlier.           How to report. If the organization checked the ""Other"" box, attach a statement showing the computation of each item included in the total for line 48. In addition, identify (a) the applicable Code section, (b) the type of tax or interest, and (c) the amount of tax or interest.

In the entry space to the left of line 51b, write ""T"" and the amount attributable to it.     Line 51d. Foreign Organizations Enter the tax withheld on unrelated business taxable income from U.S. sources that isn't effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Attach Form 1042-S, Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding, or another form which verifies the withheld tax reported on line 51d.     Line 51e. Backup Withholding Recipients of dividend or interest payments must generally certify their correct tax identification number to the bank or other payer on Form W-9. If the payer doesn’t get this information, it must withhold part of the payments as ""backup withholding."" If your organization was subject to erroneous backup withholding because the payer didn’t realize you were an exempt organization and not subject to this withholding, you can claim credit for the amount withheld by including it on line 51e. See Backup withholding under Which Parts To Complete, earlier.     Line 51f. Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums An organization described in section 501(c) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) may be eligible to claim the refundable small employer tax credit for a percentage of certain health insurance premiums paid on behalf of its employees. A tax-exempt eligible small employer can request the refundable credit by attaching Form 8941, Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums, showing the calculation for the amount of the refundable credit claimed. A tax-exempt organization isn't eligible for the refundable credit if it isn't an organization that is described in section 501(c) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a). The organization must keep records to substantiate the amount of the credit claimed.    If a tax-exempt eligible small employer is filing Form 990-T only to request a credit for small employer health insurance premiums paid, complete the following steps.    Fill in the heading (the area above Part I) except items E, H, and I.   Enter -0- on line 13, column (A), line 39, and line 49.   Enter the credit from Form 8941, line 20, on line 51f.

For a trust, this amount will be from Form 965-A, Part I, column (d), line 3.      After entering these amounts in the appropriate spaces, add them all together and enter the total on line 51g.    Form 8849, Claim for Refund of Excise Taxes, may be used to claim a periodic refund of excise taxes instead of waiting to claim a credit on Form 4136. See the Instructions for Form 8849 and Pub. 510, Excise Taxes (Including Fuel Tax Credits and Refunds).     Line 54. Tax Due Domestic organizations owing less than $500 and foreign organizations that don't have an office or place of business in the United States should enclose a check or money order (in U.S. funds), made payable to the ""United States Treasury,"" with Form 990-T. Domestic organizations owing $500 or more and foreign organizations with an office or place of business in the United States should see Depository Method of Tax Payment, earlier.      Part VI. Statements Regarding Certain Activities and Other Information Complete all items in Part VI.  Line 57. Check ""Yes,"" if either item 1 or 2 below applies.    At any time during the year the organization had an interest in or signature or other authority over a financial account in a foreign country (such as a bank account, securities account, or other financial account); and    The combined value of the accounts was more than $10,000 at any time during the year; and   The accounts were not with a U.S. military banking facility operated by a U.S. financial institution.      The organization owns more than 50% of the stock in any corporation that would answer ""Yes"" to item 1, earlier.      If the ""Yes,"" box is checked, write the name of the foreign country or countries. Attach a separate sheet if more space is needed. Get FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), to see if the organization is considered to have an interest in or signature or other authority over a financial account in a foreign country (such as a bank account, securities account, or other financial account). If the organization is required to file this form, file FinCEN Form 114 electronically with the Department of the Treasury using FinCEN's BSA E-Filing System. Because FinCEN Form 114 isn't a tax form, don't file it with Form 990-T. See www.fincen.gov for more information.   Line 58. The organization may be required to file Form 3520, Annual Return To Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts, if:     It directly or indirectly transferred money or property to a foreign trust. For this purpose, any U.S. person who created a foreign trust is considered a transferor;   It is treated as the owner of any part of the assets of a foreign trust under the grantor trust rules; or   It received a distribution from a foreign trust.      See the Instructions for Form 3520.    An owner of a foreign trust must ensure that the trust files an annual information return on Form 3520-A, Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a U.S. Owner. For details, see the Instructions for Form 3520-A.   Line 59. Report any tax-exempt interest received or accrued in the space provided. Include any exempt-interest dividends received as a shareholder in a mutual fund or other regulated investment company.     Signature  Corporations. The return must be signed and dated by the president, vice president, treasurer, assistant treasurer, chief accounting officer, or by any other corporate officer (such as a tax officer) authorized to sign. Receivers, trustees, or assignees must also sign and date any return filed on behalf of the organization.   Trusts. The return must be signed and dated by the individual fiduciary, or by the authorized officer of the trust receiving or having custody or control and management of the income of the trust. If two or more individuals act jointly as fiduciaries, any one of them may sign.     Special rule for IRA trusts. A trustee of IRA trusts may use a facsimile signature if all of the following conditions are met.    Each group of returns sent to the IRS must be accompanied by a letter signed by the person authorized to sign the returns declaring, under penalties of perjury, that the facsimile signature appearing on the returns is the signature adopted by that person to sign the returns filed and that the signature was affixed to the returns by that person or at that person's direction.   The letter must also list each return by the name and EIN of the IRA trust.   After the facsimile signature is affixed, no entries on the return may be altered other than to correct discernible arithmetic errors.   A manually signed copy (of the letter submitted to the IRS with the returns and a record of any arithmetic errors corrected) must be retained on behalf of the IRA trusts listed in the letter and it must be available for inspection by the IRS.        Paid preparer. If an officer of the organization filled in its return, the paid preparer's space should remain blank. Anyone who prepares the return but doesn’t charge the organization should not sign the return. Certain others who prepare the return should not sign. For example, a regular, full-time employee of the organization, such as a clerk, secretary, etc. should not sign. Generally, anyone who is paid to prepare the organization's tax return must sign it and fill in the Paid Preparer Use Only area. The paid preparer must complete the required preparer information.    Sign the return in the space provided for the preparer's signature.   Give a copy of the return to the organization.        Note. A paid preparer may sign original returns, amended returns, or requests for filing extension by rubber stamp, mechanical device, or computer software program. Also, facsimile signatures are authorized.   Paid preparer authorization. If the organization wants to allow the IRS to discuss this tax return with the paid preparer who signed it, check the ""Yes"" box in the signature area of the return. This authorization applies only to the individual whose signature appears in the Paid Preparer Use Only section of its return. It doesn’t apply to the firm, if any, shown in that section. If the ""Yes,"" box is checked, the organization is authorizing the IRS to call the paid preparer to:     Give the IRS any information that is missing from its return,   Call the IRS for information about the processing of its return or the status of its refund or payment(s), and   Respond to certain IRS notices that the organization has shared with the preparer about a math error, offsets, and return preparation. The notices won't be sent to the preparer.      The organization isn't authorizing the paid preparer to receive any refund check, bind the organization to anything (including any additional tax liability), or otherwise represent the organization before the IRS. If the organization wants to expand the paid preparer's authorization, see Pub. 947, Practice Before the IRS and Power of Attorney. The authorization can’t be revoked. However, the authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (excluding extension) for filing next year's Form 990-T.      Enter the paid preparer’s PTIN, not his or her social security number (SSN), in the “PTIN” box in the paid preparer’s block. Because Form 990-T is publicly disclosable when filed by a 501(c)(3) organization, any information entered in this block will be publicly disclosed. For more information about PTIN's, visit the IRS website at IRS.gov/Taxpros.     Schedule A. Cost of Goods Sold Generally, inventories are required at the beginning and end of each tax year if the production, purchase, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing factor. See Regulations section 1.471-1. However, if the organization is a qualifying taxpayer or a qualifying small business taxpayer, it may adopt or change its accounting method to account for inventoriable items in the same manner as materials and supplies that aren't incidental (unless its business is a tax shelter (as defined in section 448(d)(3))). A qualifying taxpayer is a taxpayer that, for each prior tax year ending after December 16, 1998, has average annual gross receipts of $1 million or less for the 3-tax-year period ending with that prior tax year. A qualifying small business taxpayer is a taxpayer (a) that has average annual gross receipts of $26 million or less for the 3-tax-year period ending with that prior tax year, and (b) whose principal business activity isn't an ineligible activity. Under this accounting method, inventory cost for raw materials purchased for use in producing finished goods and merchandise purchased for resale are deductible in the year the finished goods or merchandise are sold (but not before the year the organization paid for the raw materials or merchandise, if it is also using the cash method). For additional guidance on this method of accounting for inventoriable items, see Pub. 538 and the Instructions for Form 3115. Enter amounts paid for all raw materials and merchandise during the tax year on line 2. The amount the organization can deduct for the tax year is figured on line 7. All filers not using the cash method of accounting should see Section 263A uniform capitalization rules, earlier in the instructions for Limitations on Deductions before completing Schedule A. The instructions for lines 1, 4a, 4b, and 6 later apply to Schedule A.  Inventory valuation methods. Inventories can be valued at:     Cost as described in Regulations section 1.471-3,   Lower of cost or market as described in Regulations section 1.471-4, or   Any other method approved by the IRS that conforms to the requirements of the applicable regulations cited below.      However, if the organization is using the cash method of accounting, it is required to use cost. A small producer is one whose average annual gross receipts are $1 million or less. Small producers that account for inventories in the same manner as materials and supplies that aren't incidental may currently deduct expenditures for direct labor and all indirect costs that would otherwise be included in inventory costs. The average cost (rolling average) method of valuing inventories generally doesn’t conform to the requirement of the regulations. See Rev. Rul. 71-234, 1971-1 C.B. 148. Organizations that use erroneous valuation methods must change to a method permitted for federal income tax purposes. File Form 3115 to make this change. Inventory may be valued below cost when the merchandise is unsalable at normal prices or unusable in the normal way because the goods are subnormal because of damage, imperfections, shop wear, etc., within the meaning of Regulations section 1.471-2(c). The goods may be valued at the bona fide selling price, minus direct cost of disposition (but not less than scrap value). Bona fide selling price means actual offering of goods during a period ending not later than 30 days after inventory date. If this is the first year the Last-in First-out (LIFO) inventory method was either adopted or extended to inventory goods not previously valued under the LIFO method provided in section 472, attach Form 970, Application To Use LIFO Inventory Method, or a statement with the information required by Form 970. If the organization changed or extended its inventory method to LIFO and had to write up the opening inventory to cost in the year of election, report the effect of this write-up as other income (line 12) proportionately over a 3-year period that begins in the tax year the LIFO election was made (section 472(d)).   Schedule A, line 1. If the organization is changing its method of accounting to no longer account for inventories, it must refigure last year's closing inventory using the new method of accounting and enter the result on line 1. If there is a difference between last year's closing inventory and the refigured amount, attach an explanation and take it into account when figuring the organization's section 481(a) adjustment (explained earlier).   Schedule A, line 4a. An entry is required on this line only for organizations that have elected a simplified method of accounting. For organizations that have elected the simplified production method, additional section 263A costs are generally those costs, other than interest, that are now required to be capitalized under section 263A but that weren’t capitalized under the organization's method of accounting immediately prior to the effective date of section 263A. For details, see Regulations section 1.263A-2(b). For organizations that have elected the simplified resale method, additional section 263A costs are generally those costs incurred with respect to the following categories.    Off-site storage or warehousing;   Purchasing;   Handling, such as processing, assembling, repackaging, and transporting; and    General and administrative costs (mixed service costs).      For details, see Regulations section 1.263A-3(d). Enter on line 4a the balance of section 263A costs paid or incurred during the tax year not included on lines 2 and 3.   Schedule A, line 4b. Enter on line 4b any costs paid or incurred during the tax year not entered on lines 2 through 4a.   Schedule A, line 6. See Regulations sections 1.263A-1 through 1.263A-3 for details on figuring the amount of additional section 263A costs to be included in ending inventory. If the organization accounts for inventories in the same manner as materials and supplies that aren't incidental, enter on line 6 the portion of its raw materials and merchandise purchased for resale that are included on line 5 and weren’t sold during the year.      Schedule C. Rent Income Section 501(c)(7), (9), and (17) organizations, enter gross rents in Part I, line 6, and applicable expenses in Part II, lines 14 through 27. All rents except those that are exempt function income must be included. All organizations that have applicable rent income, other than section 501(c)(7), (9), and (17) organizations, should complete Schedule C. For organizations other than section 501(c)(7), (9), and (17) organizations, only the following rents are taxable in Part I, line 6.    Rents from personal property leased with real property, if the rents from the personal property are more than 10% of the total rents received or accrued under the lease, determined at the time the personal property is placed in service.   Rents from real and personal property if;    More than 50% of the total rents received or accrued under the lease are for personal property; or   The amount of the rent depends on the income or profits derived by any person from the property leased (except an amount based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales).         A redetermination of the percentage of rent for personal property is required when either:    There is an increase of 100% or more by the placing of additional or substitute personal property in service, or   There is a modification of the lease that changes the rent charged.      Rents from both real and personal property not taxable in Part I, line 6, may be taxable on line 8 if the income is from a controlled organization or on line 7 if the property is debt-financed. Taxability of the rents must be considered in that order; that is, rents not taxed on line 6 may be taxed on line 8 and rents not taxed on line 6 or line 8 may be taxed on line 7. Rents from personal property not leased with real property should be reported on Part I, line 12. See Form 8582 (for trusts) or Form 8810 (for corporations) and section 469 for limitations on losses from rental activities.     Schedule E. Unrelated Debt-Financed Income  Schedule E applies to all organizations except sections 501(c)(7), (9), and (17) organizations. When a debt-financed property is held for exempt purposes and other purposes, the organization must allocate the basis, debt, income, and deductions among the purposes for which the property is held. Don't include in Schedule E amounts allocated to exempt purposes.    For section 514 purposes, don't treat an interest in a qualified state tuition program (QSTP) as debt. However, a QSTP's investment income is treated as debt-financed income if the QSTP incurs indebtedness when acquiring or improving income-producing property.  Column 1. A property held to produce income is debt-financed property if at any time during the tax year there was acquisition indebtedness outstanding for the property. When a property held for the production of income by an organization is disposed of at a gain during the tax year, and there was acquisition indebtedness outstanding for that property at any time during the 12-month period before the date of disposition, the property is debt-financed property. Securities purchased on margin are considered debt-financed property if the liability incurred in purchasing them remains outstanding.  Acquisition indebtedness is the outstanding amount of principal debt incurred by the organization to acquire or improve the property. Acquisition indebtedness also includes indebtedness incurred:    Before the property was acquired or improved, if the indebtedness would not have been incurred but for such acquisition or improvement of the property; or   After the property was acquired or improved, if the indebtedness would not have been incurred but for such acquisition or improvement and the incurrence of such indebtedness was reasonably foreseeable at the time of such acquisition or improvement. See Regulations section 1.514(c)-1(a).      With certain exceptions, acquisition indebtedness doesn’t include debt incurred by:     A qualified (section 401) trust in acquiring or improving real property. See section 514(c)(9).   A tax-exempt school (section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii)) and its affiliated support organizations (section 509(a)(3)) for indebtedness incurred after July 18, 1984.   An organization described in section 501(c)(25) in tax years beginning after December 31, 1986.   An obligation, to the extent that it is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, to finance the purchase, rehabilitation, or construction of housing for low and moderate income persons, or indebtedness incurred by a small business investment company licensed after October 22, 2004, under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 if such indebtedness is evidenced by a debenture issued by such company under section 303(a) of that Act, and held or guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (see section 514(c)(6)(B) for limitations).    A retirement income account described in section 403(b)(9) in acquiring or improving real property in tax years beginning on or after August 17, 2006.      See Pub. 598 for additional exceptions to the rules for debt-financed property.   Column 2. Income isn't unrelated debt-financed income if it is otherwise included in unrelated business taxable income. For example, don't include rents from personal property shown in Schedule C, or rents and interest from controlled organizations shown in Schedule F.   Column 4. Average acquisition indebtedness for any tax year is the average amount of the outstanding principal debt during the part of the tax year the property is held by the organization. To figure the average amount of acquisition debt, determine the amount of the outstanding principal debt on the first day of each calendar month during that part of the tax year that the organization holds the property. Add these amounts together, and divide the result by the total number of months during the tax year that the organization held the property. See section 514(a) and the related regulations for property acquired for an indeterminate price.   Column 5. The average adjusted basis for debt-financed property is the average of the adjusted basis of the property on the first and last days during the tax year that the organization holds the property. Determine the adjusted basis of property under section 1011. Adjust the basis of the property by the depreciation for all earlier tax years, whether or not the organization was exempt from tax for any of these years. Similarly, for tax years during which the organization is subject to tax on unrelated business taxable income, adjust the basis of the property by the entire amount of allowable depreciation, even though only a part of the deduction for depreciation is taken into account in figuring unrelated business taxable income. If no adjustments to the basis of property under section 1011 apply, the basis of the property is cost. See section 514(d) and the related regulations for the basis of debt-financed property acquired in a complete or partial liquidation of a corporation in exchange for its stock.   Column 7. The amount of income from debt-financed property included in unrelated trade or business income is figured by multiplying the property's gross income by the percentage obtained from dividing the property's average acquisition indebtedness for the tax year by the property's average adjusted basis during the period it is held in the tax year. This percentage cannot be more than 100%.   Column 8. For each debt-financed property, deduct the same percentage (as determined earlier) of the total deductions that are directly connected to the income (including the dividends-received deductions allowed by sections 243, 244, and 245). However, if the debt-financed property is depreciable property, figure the depreciation deduction by the straight line method only and enter the amount in column 3(a). For each debt-financed property, attach statements showing separately a computation of the depreciation deduction (if any) reported in column 3(a) and a breakdown of the expenses included in column 3(b). Corporations owning stock that is unrelated debt-financed property should see Schedule C (Dividends and Special Deductions) of Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return, to determine the dividends-received deductions to include in column 3(b). Enter on the last line of Schedule E the total dividends-received deductions (after reduction, when applicable, by the debt-basis percentage(s)) included in column 8. When a capital loss for the tax year may be carried back or carried over to another tax year, the amount to carry over or back is figured by using the percentage determined above. However, in the year to which the amounts are carried, don't apply the debt-basis percentage to determine the deduction for that year.   Example 1. An exempt organization owns a four-story building. Two floors are used for an exempt purpose and two floors are rented (as an unrelated trade or business) for $10,000. Expenses are $1,000 for depreciation and $5,000 for other expenses that relate to the entire building. The average acquisition indebtedness is $6,000, and the average adjusted basis is $10,000. Both apply to the entire building. To complete Schedule E for this example, describe the property in column 1. Enter $10,000 in column 2 (since the entire amount is for debt-financed property), $500 and $2,500 in columns 3(a) and 3(b), respectively (since only one-half of the expenses are for the debt-financed property), $3,000 and $5,000 in columns 4 and 5, respectively (since only one-half of the acquisition indebtedness and the average adjusted basis are for debt-financed property), 60% in column 6, $6,000 in column 7, and $1,800 in column 8.     Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except the entire building is rented out as an unrelated trade or business for $20,000. To complete Schedule E for this example, enter $20,000 in column 2, $1,000 and $5,000 in columns 3(a) and 3(b), respectively (since the entire amount is for debt-financed property), $6,000 and $10,000 in columns 4 and 5 (since the entire amount is for debt-financed property), 60% in column 6, $12,000 in column 7, and $3,600 in column 8.         Schedule F. Interest, Annuities, Royalties, and Rents From Controlled Organizations Interest, annuities, royalties, and rents received or accrued (directly or indirectly) by a controlling organization from a controlled organization are subject to tax, whether or not the activity conducted by the controlling organization to earn these amounts is a trade or business or is regularly conducted.  Controlled organization. An entity is a ""controlled organization"" if the controlling organization owns:      By vote or value more than 50% of a corporation's stock (for an organization that is a corporation);   More than 50% of a partnership's profits or capital interests (for an organization that is a partnership); or   More than 50% of the beneficial interests in an organization (for an organization other than a corporation or partnership).      To determine the ownership of stock in a corporation, apply the principles of section 318 (constructive ownership of stock). Apply similar principles to determine the ownership of interests in partnership or any other organization.   Specified payment. Specified payment means any payment of interest, annuities, royalties, or rents. Include the specified payment in gross income to the extent that the payment reduces the net unrelated income (or increases the net unrelated loss) of the controlled organization. If any part of a specified payment is included in gross income, Schedule F must be completed.   Qualifying specified payment. Qualifying specified payment means any payment of interest, annuities, royalties, or rents received or accrued from the controlled organization after 2005, pursuant to a binding written contract that was in effect on August 17, 2006, or is a renewable contract under substantially similar terms of a contract in effect on August 17, 2006. Qualifying specified payments are subject to tax only on the amount that exceeds what would have been paid or accrued if such payment had been determined under the principles of section 482.    Column 1 and 2. List every controlled entity and its EIN from which your organization received interest, annuities, royalties, or rents. For each of the columns, if a controlled organization makes specified payments, some of which are qualifying specified payments and some of which aren't, report the qualifying specified payments on one line and all other specified payments on another line. Thus, the organization must repeat the name of any controlled organization from which the organization receives both specified payments and qualifying specified payments.   Column 3. Enter the net unrelated income (or net unrelated loss) of each controlled entity listed that is exempt from tax under section 501(a).    Column 7. Enter each controlled organization's taxable income.   Column 8. Enter the net unrelated income (or net unrelated loss) of each controlled entity listed that isn't exempt from tax under section 501(a). Net unrelated income is that portion of the controlled entity's taxable income that would be unrelated business taxable income if the entity were exempt under section 501(a) and had the same exempt purposes as the controlling organization. Net unrelated loss is the controlled organization's net operating loss adjusted under rules similar to those used to determine net unrelated income.   Column 4 or 9. For each controlled organization, enter the total of specified payments received from each controlled organization. If the organization received both specified payments and qualifying specified payments from a controlled organization, enter specified payments on one line and qualifying specified payments on another so that there are dual entries for that controlled organization.   Column 5 or 10. For specified payments, enter the portion of columns 4 or 9 to the extent that the payment reduced the net unrelated income (or increased the net unrelated loss) of the controlled entity.   Column 6 or 11. Enter only those deductions directly connected with the income entered in columns 5 or 10.  With respect to qualifying specified payments, enter only that portion of expenses directly connected to the amounts included in columns 5 or 10, that is, the excess of the payment over the fair market value amount as determined in accordance with section 482. Don't enter any expenses relating to the portion of such payment that isn't includible in income under this special rule.    For valuation misstatements regarding qualifying specified payments, there is a 20% addition to tax. See section 512(b)(13)(E)(ii).    Excess qualifying specified payments. Excess qualifying specified payments received or accrued from a controlled entity (that is, the amount of qualifying specified payments in excess of what would have been paid or accrued if the payments had been determined under section 482) are included in a controlling exempt organization's unrelated business taxable income.      Schedule G. Investment Income of a Section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) Organization  Generally, for section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) organizations, unrelated trade or business income includes all gross income from nonmembers with certain modifications. See section 512(a)(3)(A). Report on Schedule G all income from investments in securities and other similar investment income from nonmembers, including 100% of income and directly connected expenses from debt-financed property. Don't report nonmember income from debt-financed property on Schedule E. All section 501(c)(7), (9), and (17) organizations figure their investment income using Schedule G. Don't include interest on state and local governmental obligations described in section 103(a). Investment income includes all income from debt-financed property. Deduct only those expenses that are directly connected to the net investment income. Allocate deductions between exempt activities and other activities where necessary. The organization may not take the dividends-received deductions in figuring net investment income because they aren't treated as directly connected with the production of gross income. Section 501(c)(7), (9), and (17) organizations may set aside income that would otherwise be taxable under section 512(a)(3). However, income derived from an unrelated trade or business may not be set aside and thus can’t be exempt function income. In addition, any income set aside and later expended for other purposes must be included in income. Section 501(c)(7), (9), and (17) organizations won't be taxed on income set aside for:    Religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals (and reasonable administration costs directly connected to such purposes); or   The payment of life, sickness, accident, or other benefits (and reasonable administration costs directly connected to such benefits) by a section 501(c)(9) or (17) organization. The amount allowed as a set aside may not exceed a limit determined using section 512(a)(3)(E). See sections 512(a)(3)(E) and 419A for details.      Report income set aside in Schedule G, column 4. Amounts set aside aren't deductible under section 170 or any other section of the Code. The organization may elect to treat income set aside by the date for filing the return, including any extension of time, as income set aside in the tax year for which the return is filed. The income set aside must have been includible in gross income for that earlier tax year. Although set aside income may be accumulated, any accumulation that is unreasonable will be evidence that the set aside wasn’t for the purposes previously mentioned. Net investment income set aside must be specifically earmarked as such, or placed in a separate account or fund (except for a section 501(c)(9) or (17) organization which, by the terms of its governing instrument, must use its net investment income for the purposes stated in 2, earlier). These rules apply to a corporation described in section 501(c)(2) (title holding corporation) whose income is payable to an organization described in section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) if it files a consolidated return with the section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) organization. If a section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) organization (or a title holding corporation described earlier) sells property that was used for the exempt function of the section 501(c)(7), (9), or (17) organization and buys other property used for the organization's exempt function within a period beginning 1 year before the date of the sale, and ending 3 years after the date of the sale, the gain from the sale will be recognized only to the extent that the sales price of the old property is more than the cost of the other property. The other property need not be similar in type or use to the old property. The organization must notify the IRS of the sale by a statement attached to the return, or other written notice. To compute the gain on the sale of depreciable property, see the instructions for Schedule E, column 5, to determine the adjusted basis of the property.     Schedule I. Exploited Exempt Activity Income, Other Than Advertising Income Exempt organizations that have gross income from an unrelated trade or business activity that exploits an exempt activity (other than periodical advertising income reportable in Schedule J) should complete Schedule I. See Regulations section 1.513-1(d)(4)(iv) for a definition of exploited exempt activity. Report income from advertising other than in a periodical in Schedule I. An exempt organization may take all deductions directly connected with the gross income from the unrelated trade or business activity. In addition, the exempt organization may take into account all deductible items attributable to the exploited exempt activity, with the following limitations.    Reduce the deductible items of the exempt activity by the income from the activity;   Limit the net amount of deductible items arrived at in item 1, earlier, for the exempt activity to the net unrelated business income from the exploited exempt activity;   Exclude income and expenses of the exempt activity in figuring a loss carryover or carryback from the unrelated trade or business activity exploiting the exempt activity; and   Exclude deductible items of the exempt activity in figuring unrelated trade or business income from an activity that isn't exploiting the same exempt activity.      As a result, the net includible exploited exempt activity income is the unrelated business taxable income minus the excess of the exempt activity expenses over the exempt activity income. If the income from the exempt activity exceeds the exempt activity expenses, don't add that profit to the net income from the unrelated business activity. Attach a separate statement showing the computation.     Schedule J. Advertising Income An exempt organization that earned gross income from the sale of advertising in an exempt organization periodical must complete Schedule J. The part of the advertising income taken into account is determined as follows.    If direct advertising costs (expenses directly connected with advertising income) are more than advertising income (unrelated business income), deduct that excess in figuring unrelated business taxable income from any other unrelated trade or business activity conducted by the organization.   If advertising income is more than direct advertising costs, and circulation income (exempt activity income) equals or exceeds readership costs (exempt activity expenses), then unrelated business taxable income is the excess of advertising income over direct advertising costs.   If advertising income is more than direct advertising costs, and readership costs are more than circulation income, then unrelated business taxable income is the excess of total income (advertising income and circulation income) over total periodical costs (direct advertising costs and readership costs).   If the readership costs are more than the circulation income, and the net readership costs are more than the excess of advertising income over direct advertising costs, no loss is allowable. See Regulations section 1.512(a)-1(f)(2)(ii)(b).      For allocating membership receipts to circulation income, see Rev. Rul. 81-101, 1981-1 C.B. 352.  Consolidated periodicals. If an organization publishes two or more periodicals, it may elect to treat the gross income for all (but not less than all) periodicals, and deductions directly connected with those periodicals (including excess readership costs) as if the periodicals were one to determine its unrelated business taxable income. This rule only applies to periodicals published for the production of income. A periodical is considered published for the production of income if gross advertising income of the periodical is at least 25% of the readership costs, and the periodical is an activity engaged in for profit.      Schedule K. Compensation of Officers, Directors, and Trustees  Complete columns 1 through 4 for those officers, directors, and trustees whose salaries or other compensation are allocable to unrelated business gross income. Don't include in column 4 compensation that is deducted on lines 15, 27, or Schedules A through J. Include on Schedule K (or elsewhere on the return) only compensation that is directly attributable to the unrelated trade or business activities of the organization. If personnel are used both to conduct exempt activities and to conduct unrelated trade or business activities, the salaries and wages of those individuals will be allocated between the activities. For example, assume an exempt organization derives gross income from the conduct of certain unrelated trade or business activities. The organization pays its president a salary of $65,000 a year. Ten percent of the president's time is devoted to the unrelated business activity. On Form 990-T, the organization enters $6,500 (10% of $65,000) on Schedule K for the part of the president's salary allocable to the unrelated trade or business activity. However, the remaining $58,500 (90% of $65,000) cannot be deducted on Form 990-T because it isn't directly attributable to the organization's unrelated trade or business activities. If taxable fringe benefits are provided to your employees, such as personal use of a car, don't deduct as salaries and wages the amounts you deducted for depreciation and other deductions.     Schedule M. Unrelated Business Taxable Income for Unrelated Trade or Business  An organization with more than one unrelated trade or business should complete Part I and Part II on page 1 of Form 990-T and complete and attach a separate Schedule M for each additional unrelated trade or business. Report the sum of the unrelated business taxable income from line 31 of Form 990-T and each Schedule M on Part III, line 32. For an organization filing one or more Schedules M, if line 31 of Form 990-T or any Schedule M is less than zero, do not include it in the sum reported on Part III, line 32. When completing Schedule M, refer to the instructions for Parts I and II for the corresponding lines on Schedule M. Complete only the lines relevant to the unrelated trade or business being reported on Schedule M. Complete and attach statements containing the information required by Schedules A through K as necessary. Filers may fill in blank copies of Schedules A through K for this purpose. The statements should be labeled at the top to identify the trade or business to which they relate and should be submitted behind the applicable Schedule M. If more space is needed on Schedule M, attach separate sheets using the same size and format as the printed forms. If there are supporting statements and attachments, label the filer’s name, EIN, and identify the unrelated trade or business (Schedule M) to which they are related, and submit them immediately behind Schedule M.       Instructions for Form 990-T - Notices          Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.     We ask for the information on these forms to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States. You are required to give us the information. We need it to ensure that you are complying with these laws and to allow us to figure and collect the right amount of tax. You are not required to provide the information requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB control number. Books or records relating to a form or its instructions must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any Internal Revenue law. Generally, tax returns and return information are confidential, as required by section 6103. Estimates of Taxpayer Burden. These include Forms in the 990 series and attachments and 1023, 1024, 1028, 5578, 5884-C, 8038, 8038-B, 8038-CP, 8038-G, 8038-GC, 8038-R, 8038-T, 8038-TC, 8328, 8718, 8282, 8453-EO, 8453-X, 8868, 8870, 8871, 8872, 8879-EO, 8886-T, 8899 and their schedules and all the forms tax-exempt organizations attach to their tax returns. Time spent and out-of-pocket costs are presented separately. Time burden includes the time spent preparing to file and to file, with recordkeeping representing the largest component. Out-of-pocket costs include any expenses incurred by taxpayers to prepare and submit their tax returns. Examples include tax return preparation and submission fees, postage and photocopying costs, and tax preparation software costs. Note that these estimates do not include burden associated with post-filing activities. IRS operational data indicate that electronically prepared and filed returns have fewer arithmetic errors, implying lower post-filing burden. Reported time and cost burdens are national averages and do not necessarily reflect a “typical” case. Most taxpayers experience lower than average burden, with taxpayer burden varying considerably by taxpayer type. For instance, the estimated average time burden for all taxpayers filing Forms 990, 990-EZ, 990-PF, 990-T, and 990-N and related forms is 32.7 hours, with an average cost of $932 per return. This average includes all associated forms and schedules, across all preparation methods and taxpayer activities.    Fiscal Year 2020 Form 990 Series Tax Compliance Cost Estimates               Form 990 Form 990-EZ Form 990-PF Form 990-T Form 990-N     Projections of the Number of Returns to be Filed with IRS 315,762 232,345 118,192 198,798 741,133   Estimates Average Total Time (Hours) 85 45 47 40 2   Estimated Average Total Out-of-Pocket Costs $2,600 $500 $2,000 $1,500 $10   Estimated Average Total Monetized Burden $8,000 $1,200 $3,900 $4,400 $30   Estimates Total Time (Hours) 26,760,000 10,500,000 5,510,000 8,040,000 1,630,000   Estimated Total Out-of-Pocket Costs (Note: Totals may not add due to rounding.) $835,700,000 $127,500,000 $236,200,000 $290,300,000 $6,800,000   Note: Amounts above are for FY2020.

80,2019 Instructions for Schedule J (2019),"   2019 Instructions for Schedule J (2019)  2019        Income Averaging for Farmers and Fishermen       Introduction Use Schedule J (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) to elect to figure your 2019 income tax by averaging, over the previous 3 years (base years), all or part of your 2019 taxable income from your trade or business of farming or fishing. This election may give you a lower tax if your 2019 income from farming or fishing is high and your taxable income for 1 or more of the 3 prior years was low. In order to qualify for this election, you aren't required to have been in the business of farming or fishing during any of the base years. You may elect to average farming or fishing income even if your filing status wasn't the same in the election year and the base years. This election doesn't apply when figuring your alternative minimum tax on Form 6251. Also, you don't have to refigure, because of this election, the tax liability of any minor child who was required to use your tax rates in the prior years.     Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Schedule J (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/ScheduleJ.      General Instructions      Prior Year Tax Returns You may need copies of your original or amended income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018 to figure your tax on Schedule J. If you need copies of your tax returns, use Form 4506. There is a fee for each return requested. See Form 4506 for the fee amount. If your main home, principal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared disaster area, this fee will be waived. If you want a free transcript of your tax return or account, use Form 4506-T. See your Form 1040 or 1040-SR instructions to find out how to get these forms. Keep a copy of your 2019 income tax return to use for income averaging in 2020, 2021, or 2022.     Definitions  Farming business.  A farming business is the trade or business of cultivating land or raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity. This includes:      Operating a nursery or sod farm;   Raising or harvesting of trees bearing fruits, nuts, or other crops;   Raising ornamental trees (but not evergreen trees that are more than 6 years old when severed from the roots);   Raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training, and managing animals; and   Leasing land to a tenant engaged in a farming business, but only if the lease payments are (a) based on a share of the tenant's production (not a fixed amount), and (b) determined under a written agreement entered into before the tenant begins significant activities on the land.          A farming business doesn't include:      Contract harvesting of an agricultural or horticultural commodity grown or raised by someone else, or   Merely buying or reselling plants or animals grown or raised by someone else.            Fishing business. A fishing business is the trade or business of fishing in which the fish harvested, either in whole or in part, are intended to enter commerce or enter commerce through sale, barter, or trade. This includes:    The catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;   The attempted catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;   Any other activity which can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;    Any operations at sea in support of, or in preparation for, any activity described in (1) through (3) above;   Leasing a fishing vessel, but only if the lease payments are (a) based on a share of the catch (or a share of the proceeds from the sale of the catch) from the lessee's use of the vessel in a fishing business (not a fixed payment), and (b) determined under a written lease entered into before the lessee begins any significant fishing activities resulting in the catch; and   Compensation as a crew member on a vessel engaged in a fishing business, but only if the compensation is based on a share of the catch (or a share of the proceeds from the sale of the catch).      The word ""fish"" means finfish, mollusks, crustaceans, and all other forms of marine animal and plant life other than marine mammals and birds. A fishing business doesn't include any scientific research activity conducted by a scientific research vessel.    Settlement from Exxon Valdez litigation. You will be treated as engaged in a fishing business with respect to any qualified settlement income you received if either of the following applies.    You were a plaintiff in the civil action In re Exxon Valdez, No. 89-095-CV (HRH) (Consolidated) (D. Alaska); or   All of the following apply.    You were a beneficiary of a plaintiff described in (1) above.   You acquired the right to receive qualified settlement income from that plaintiff.   You were the spouse or an immediate relative of that plaintiff.         Qualified settlement income is any taxable interest and punitive damage awards you received (whether as lump sums or periodic payments) in connection with the Exxon Valdez civil action described above. Qualified settlement income includes all such awards, whether received before or after the judgment and whether related to a settlement or a judgment.       Additional Information See Pub. 225 and Regulations section 1.1301-1 for more information.      Specific Instructions      Line 2a    Elected Farm Income  To figure your elected farm income, first figure your taxable income from farming or fishing. This includes all income, gains, losses, and deductions attributable to your farming or fishing business. If you conduct both farming and fishing businesses, you must figure your elected farm income by combining income, gains, losses, and deductions attributable to your farming and fishing businesses. Elected farm income also includes any gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property regularly used in your farming or fishing business for a substantial period of time. However, if such gain or loss is realized after cessation of the farming or fishing business, the gain or loss is treated as attributable to a farming or fishing business only if the property is sold within a reasonable time after cessation of the farming or fishing business. A sale or other disposition within 1 year of the cessation is considered to be within a reasonable time. Elected farm income doesn't include income, gain, or loss from the sale or other disposition of land or from the sale of development rights, grazing rights, and other similar rights. You should find your income, gains, losses, and deductions from farming or fishing reported on different tax forms, such as:    2019 Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR, line 1, or Form 1040-NR, line 8, income from wages and other compensation you received (a) as a shareholder in an S corporation engaged in a farming or fishing business, or (b) as a crew member on a vessel engaged in a fishing business (but see Fishing business, earlier);   2019 Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 8, or Form 1040-NR, line 21, income from Exxon Valdez litigation;   2019 Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 14, or Form 1040-NR, line 27, deductible part of self-employment tax, but only to the extent that deduction is attributable to your farming or fishing business;   2019 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11b, or Form 1040-NR, line 41, CCF reduction, except to the extent that any earnings (without regard to the carryback of any net operating or net capital loss) from the operation of agreement vessels in the fisheries of the United States or in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States aren't attributable to your fishing business;   Schedule C;   Schedule D;   Schedule E, Part II;   Schedule F;   Form 4797;   Form 4835;   Form 8903, Domestic Production Activities Deduction, but only to the extent that deduction is attributable to your farming or fishing business; and   Form 8949.      Your elected farm income is the amount of your taxable income from farming or fishing that you elect to include on line 2a.    You don't have to include all of your taxable income from farming or fishing on line 2a. It may be to your advantage to include less than the entire amount, depending on how the amount you include on line 2a affects your tax bracket for the current and prior 3 tax years. The excess farm loss rules don't apply for tax years beginning after 2017. The excess business loss disallowance rule replaces the limitation on excess farm loss. Your elected farm income can’t include excess business losses. See the Instructions for Schedule F (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) and Form 461. Your elected farm income can't exceed your taxable income.      Lines 2b and 2c Complete lines 2b and 2c if the amount of your elected farm income on line 2a includes net capital gain. Net capital gain is the excess, if any, of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss.  Line 2b. Enter on line 2b the portion of your elected farm income on line 2a treated as a net capital gain. The amount you enter on line 2b can't exceed the smaller of your total net capital gain or the net capital gain attributable to your farming or fishing business.   Line 2c. Enter on line 2c the smaller of line 2b or the unrecaptured section 1250 gain attributable to your farming or fishing business, if any.      Line 4 Figure the tax on the amount on line 3 using:    The 2019 Tax Table, Tax Computation Worksheet, or Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet from the 2019 Instructions for Form 1040 or 1040-SR or Form 1040-NR;   The 2019 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet from the 2019 Instructions for Form 1040 or 1040-SR; or   The Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the 2019 Instructions for Schedule D.      Enter the tax on line 4.     Line 5 If you used Schedule J to figure your tax for:    2018 (that is, you entered the amount from the 2018 Schedule J, line 23; on your 2018 Form 1040, line 11a; on your 2018 Form 1040NR, line 42; or on Form 1040X for 2018), enter on line 5 the amount from your 2018 Schedule J, line 11.   2017 but not 2018, enter on line 5 the amount from your 2017 Schedule J, line 15.   2016 but not 2017 or 2018, enter on line 5 the amount from your 2016 Schedule J, line 3.      If you figured your tax for 2016, 2017, and 2018 without using Schedule J, enter on line 5 the taxable income from your 2016 tax return (or as previously adjusted by the IRS, or corrected on an amended return). But if that amount is zero or less, complete the 2016 Taxable Income Worksheet to figure the amount to enter on line 5. If you didn't file a tax return for 2016, use the amount you would have reported as your taxable income had you been required to file a tax return. Be sure to keep all your records for 2016 for at least 3 years after April 15, 2020 (or the date you file your 2019 tax return, if later).       Instructions for 2016 Taxable Income Worksheet     Line 2. Any net capital loss deduction on your 2016 Schedule D, line 21, isn't allowed for income averaging purposes to the extent it didn't reduce your capital loss carryover to 2017. This could happen if the taxable income before subtracting exemptions—shown on your 2016 Form 1040, line 41, or your 2016 Form 1040NR, line 39 (or as previously adjusted)—was less than zero. Enter on line 2 the amount by which your 2016 capital loss carryover to 2017 (the sum of your short- and long-term capital loss carryovers) exceeds the excess of the loss on your 2016 Schedule D, line 16, over the loss on your 2016 Schedule D, line 21. If you had any Net Operating Loss (NOL) carrybacks to 2016, be sure you refigured your 2016 capital loss carryover to 2017.   Line 3. If you had an NOL for 2016, enter the amount of that NOL from the 2016 Form 1045, Schedule A, line 25, you filed with Form 1045 or Form 1040X. If you didn't have an NOL for 2016, enter the portion, if any, of the NOL carryovers and carrybacks to 2016 that weren't used in 2016 and were carried to years after 2016.      Example. John Farmington, who is single, didn't use income averaging for 2016, 2017, or 2018. For 2019, John has $18,000 of elected farm income on Schedule J, line 2a. The taxable income before subtracting exemptions on his 2016 Form 1040, line 41, is $4,900. A deduction for exemptions of $4,050 is shown on line 42, and line 43, taxable income, is $850. However, John had a $20,550 NOL for 2017, $9,000 of which was remaining to carry to 2016 after the NOL was carried back to 2015. To complete line 1 of the 2016 Taxable Income Worksheet, John combines the $9,000 NOL deduction with the $850 from his 2016 Form 1040, line 43. The result is a negative $8,150, John's 2016 taxable income, which he enters as a positive amount on line 1 of the 2016 Taxable Income Worksheet. When John filed his 2016 tax return, he had a $3,000 net capital loss deduction on Schedule D, line 21 (which was also entered on Form 1040, line 13), a $7,000 loss on Schedule D, line 16, and a $4,000 capital loss carryover to 2017. However, when John carried back the 2017 NOL ($9,000 of which was carried to 2016), he refigured his 2016 capital loss carryover to 2017 as $7,000. John adds the $3,000 from Schedule D, line 21, and the $7,000 capital loss carryover. He subtracts from the $10,000 result the $7,000 loss on his Schedule D, line 16, and enters $3,000 on line 2 of the worksheet. John had $850 of taxable income in 2016 that reduced the 2017 NOL carryback. The $4,050 exemption deduction and $3,000 net capital loss deduction also reduced the amount of the 2017 NOL carryback. As a result, only $1,100 ($9,000 – $850 – $4,100 – $3,000 = $1,100) was available to carry to 2018 and later years, as shown on his 2017 Form 1045, Schedule B, line 10. John enters the $1,100 on line 3 of the worksheet, and $4,100 ($1,100 plus the $3,000 line 2 amount) on line 4. He then subtracts the $4,100 from the $8,150 on line 1 and enters the result, $4,050, on line 5 of the worksheet. He enters a negative $4,050 on Schedule J, line 5. He combines that amount with the $6,000 on Schedule J, line 6, and enters $1,950 on Schedule J, line 7.     2016 Taxable Income Worksheet—Line 5              Complete this worksheet if you didn't use Schedule J to figure your tax for 2017 and 2018 and your 2016 taxable income was zero or less. See the instructions above before completing this worksheet for line 5.   1. Figure the taxable income from your 2016 tax return (or as previously adjusted) without limiting it to zero. If you had an NOL for 2016, don't include any NOL carryovers or carrybacks to 2016. Enter the result as a positive amount 1.       2. If there is a loss on your 2016 Schedule D, line 21, add that loss (as a positive amount) and your 2016 capital loss carryover to 2017. Subtract from that sum the amount of the loss on your 2016 Schedule D, line 16, and enter the result 2.           3. If you had an NOL for 2016, enter it as a positive amount. Otherwise, enter as a positive amount the portion, if any, of the NOL carryovers and carrybacks to 2016 that weren't used in 2016 and were carried to years after 2016 3.           4. Add lines 2 and 3 4.       5. Subtract line 4 from line 1. Enter the result as a negative amount on Schedule J, line 5 5.                               Line 8 If line 7 is zero, enter -0- on line 8. Otherwise, figure the tax on the amount on line 7 using:    The 2016 Tax Rate Schedules below;   The 2016 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, later;   The 2016 Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the 2016 Schedule D instructions (but use the 2016 Tax Rate Schedules below when figuring the tax on lines 34 and 36 of the Schedule D Tax Worksheet); or   The 2016 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet, later.      If your elected farm income includes net capital gain, you must use the 2016 Schedule D Tax Worksheet to figure the tax on the amount on line 7. However, if you filed Form 2555 or 2555-EZ for 2016, you must first complete the 2016 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet, and then use the 2016 Schedule D Tax Worksheet to figure the tax on the amount on line 3 of the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet. When completing the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, you must allocate 1/3 of the amount on Schedule J, line 2b (and 1/3 of the amount on line 2c, if any) to 2016. If for 2016 you had a capital loss that resulted in a capital loss carryover to 2017, don't reduce the elected farm income allocated to 2016 by any part of the carryover.       2016 Tax Rate Schedules—Line 8                      Schedule X—Use if your 2016 filing status was Single or you checked filing status box 1 or 2 on Form 1040NR Schedule Y-2—Use if your 2016 filing status was Married filing separately or you checked filing status box 3, 4, or 5 on Form 1040NR   If Schedule J, line 7, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 8 of the amount over— If Schedule J, line 7, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 8 of the amount over—   $0 $9,275 ...........   10% $0 $0 $9,275 ...........   10% $0   9,275 37,650 $927.50 + 15% 9,275 9,275 37,650 $927.50 + 15% 9,275   37,650 91,150 5,183.75 + 25% 37,650 37,650 75,950 5,183.75 + 25% 37,650   91,150 190,150 18,558.75 + 28% 91,150 75,950 115,725 14,758.75 + 28% 75,950   190,150 413,350 46,278.75 + 33% 190,150 115,725 206,675 25,895.75 + 33% 115,725   413,350 415,050 119,934.75 + 35% 413,350 206,675 233,475 55,909.25 + 35% 206,675   415,050 ............. 120,529.75 + 39.6% 415,050 233,475 .......... 65,289.25 + 39.6% 233,475   Schedule Y-1—Use if your 2016 filing status was Married filing jointly or Qualifying widow(er) or you checked filing status box 6 on Form 1040NR Schedule Z—Use if your 2016 filing status was Head of household   If Schedule J, line 7, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 8 of the amount over— If Schedule J, line 7, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 8 of the amount over—   $0 $18,550 ...........   10% $0 $0 $13,250 ...........   10% $0   18,550 75,300 $1,855.00 + 15% 18,550 13,250 50,400 $1,325.00 + 15% 13,250   75,300 151,900 10,367.50 + 25% 75,300 50,400 130,150 6,897.50 + 25% 50,400   151,900 231,450 29,517.50 + 28% 151,900 130,150 210,800 26,835.00 + 28% 130,150   231,450 413,350 51,791.50 + 33% 231,450 210,800 413,350 49,417.00 + 33% 210,800   413,350 466,950 111,818.50 + 35% 413,350 413,350 441,000 116,258.50 + 35% 413,350   466,950 ............ 130,578.50 + 39.6% 466,950 441,000 ........... 125,936.00 + 39.6% 441,000         2016 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet—Line 8                        Use this worksheet only if both of the following apply.

Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use the Schedule D Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you had a capital gain excess. To find out if you had a capital gain excess, subtract the amount from your 2019 Schedule J, line 7, from line 6 of your 2016 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your 2016 Schedule D Tax Worksheet). If the result is more than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.   If you didn't have a capital gain excess, complete the rest of either of those worksheets according to the worksheet's instructions. Then complete lines 5 and 6 above.   If you had a capital gain excess, complete a second 2016 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or 2016 Schedule D Tax Worksheet (whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6 above. These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the 2016 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.   1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your 2016 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or line 9 of your 2016 Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.   2.

Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your 2016 Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.   4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your 2016 Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet in the 2016 Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).          Line 9 If you used Schedule J to figure your tax for:    2018 (that is, you entered the amount from the 2018 Schedule J, line 23; on your 2018 Form 1040, line 11a; 2018 Form 1040NR, line 42; or 2018 Form 1040X), enter on line 9 the amount from your 2018 Schedule J, line 15.   2017 but not 2018, enter on line 9 the amount from your 2017 Schedule J, line 3.      If you figured your tax for both 2017 and 2018 without using Schedule J, enter on line 9 the taxable income from your 2017 tax return (or as previously adjusted by the IRS or corrected on an amended return). But if that amount is zero or less, complete the worksheet below to figure the amount to enter on line 9. If you didn't file a tax return for 2017, use the amount you would have reported as your taxable income had you been required to file a tax return. Be sure to keep all your records for 2017 until at least 3 years after April 15, 2020 (or the date you file your 2019 tax return, if later).       Instructions for 2017 Taxable Income Worksheet     Line 2. Any net capital loss deduction on your 2017 Schedule D, line 21, isn't allowed for income averaging purposes to the extent it didn't reduce your capital loss carryover to 2018. This could happen if the taxable income before subtracting exemptions—shown on your 2017 Form 1040, line 41, or your 2017 Form 1040NR, line 39 (or as previously adjusted)—was less than zero. Enter on line 2 the amount by which your 2017 capital loss carryover to 2018 (the sum of your short- and long-term capital loss carryovers) exceeds the excess of the loss on your 2017 Schedule D, line 16, over the loss on your 2017 Schedule D, line 21. If you had any NOL carrybacks to 2017, be sure you refigured your 2017 capital loss carryover to 2018.   Line 3. If you had an NOL for 2017, enter the amount of that NOL from the 2017 Form 1045, Schedule A, line 25, you filed with Form 1045 or Form 1040X. If you didn't have an NOL for 2017, enter the portion, if any, of the NOL carryovers and carrybacks to 2017 that weren't used in 2017 and were carried to years after 2017.      Example. John Farmington didn't use income averaging for 2016, 2017, or 2018. The taxable income before subtracting exemptions on his 2017 Form 1040, line 41, is a negative $29,900. A deduction for exemptions of $4,050 is shown on line 42, and line 43, taxable income, is limited to zero. John subtracts from the $29,900 loss the $4,050 deduction for exemptions. The result is a negative $33,950, John's 2017 taxable income, which he enters as a positive amount on line 1 of the 2017 Taxable Income Worksheet. When John filed his 2017 tax return, he had a $3,000 net capital loss deduction on Schedule D, line 21 (which was also entered on Form 1040, line 13), and a $7,000 loss on Schedule D, line 16 (as adjusted). He also had a $7,000 capital loss carryover to 2018. John adds the $3,000 from Schedule D, line 21, and the $7,000 capital loss carryover. He subtracts from the $10,000 result the $7,000 loss on his Schedule D, line 16, and enters $3,000 on line 2 of the worksheet. John enters $20,550 on line 3 of the worksheet, the 2017 NOL from his 2017 Form 1045, Schedule A, line 25. Of the $33,950 negative taxable income, the $4,050 deduction for exemptions, the $3,000 capital loss deduction, and his $6,350 standard deduction weren't allowed in figuring the NOL. John had a $20,550 loss on his 2017 Schedule F, the only other item on his 2017 tax return. John enters $23,550 (the $3,000 line 2 amount plus the $20,550 line 3 amount) on line 4 and $10,400 (the $33,950 line 1 amount minus the $23,550 line 4 amount) on line 5. He enters $10,400 as a negative amount on Schedule J, line 9. He enters $6,000 on Schedule J, line 10, and a negative $4,400 on Schedule J, line 11. If he uses Schedule J to figure his tax for 2020, he will enter the negative $4,400 amount on his 2020 Schedule J as his 2017 taxable income for income averaging purposes.    2017 Taxable Income Worksheet—Line 9              Complete this worksheet if you didn’t use Schedule J to figure your tax for 2018 and your 2017 taxable income was zero or less. See the instructions above before completing this worksheet.   1. Figure the taxable income from your 2017 tax return (or as previously adjusted) without limiting it to zero. If you had an NOL for 2017, don't include any NOL carryovers or carrybacks to 2017. Enter the result as a positive amount 1.       2. If there is a loss on your 2017 Schedule D, line 21, add that loss (as a positive amount) and your 2017 capital loss carryover to 2018. Subtract from that sum the amount of the loss on your 2017 Schedule D, line 16, and enter the result 2.           3. If you had an NOL for 2017, enter it as a positive amount. Otherwise, enter as a positive amount the portion, if any, of the NOL carryovers and carrybacks to 2017 that weren't used in 2017 and were carried to years after 2017 3.           4. Add lines 2 and 3 4.       5. Subtract line 4 from line 1. Enter the result as a negative amount on Schedule J, line 9 5.                                  Line 12 If line 11 is zero or less, enter -0- on line 12. Otherwise, figure the tax on the amount on line 11 using:    The 2017 Tax Rate Schedules below;   The 2017 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, later;   The 2017 Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the 2017 Schedule D instructions (but use the 2017 Tax Rate Schedules below when figuring the tax on the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, lines 42 and 44); or   The 2017 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet, later.      If your elected farm income includes net capital gain, you must use the 2017 Schedule D Tax Worksheet to figure the tax on the amount on line 11. However, if you filed Form 2555 or 2555-EZ for 2017, you must first complete the 2017 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet, and then use the 2017 Schedule D Tax Worksheet to figure the tax on the amount on line 3 of the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet. When completing the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, you must allocate 1/3 of the amount on Schedule J, line 2b (and 1/3 of the amount on line 2c, if any) to 2017. If for 2017 you had a capital loss that resulted in a capital loss carryover to 2018, don't reduce the elected farm income allocated to 2017 by any part of the carryover.       2017 Tax Rate Schedules—Line 12                      Schedule X—Use if your 2017 filing status was Single or you checked filing status box 1 or 2 on Form 1040NR Schedule Y-2—Use if your 2017 filing status was Married filing separately or you checked filing status box 3, 4, or 5 on Form 1040NR   If Schedule J, line 11, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 12 of the amount over— If Schedule J, line 11, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 12 of the amount over—   $0 $9,325 ...........   10% $0 $0 $9,325 ...........   10% $0   9,325 37,950 $932.50 + 15% 9,325 9,325 37,950 $932.50 + 15% 9,325   37,950 91,900 5,226.25 + 25% 37,950 37,950 76,550 5,226.25 + 25% 37,950   91,900 191,650 18,713.75 + 28% 91,900 76,550 116,675 14,876.25 + 28% 76,550   191,650 416,700 46,643.75 + 33% 191,650 116,675 208,350 26,111.25 + 33% 116,675   416,700 418,400 120,910.25 + 35% 416,700 208,350 235,350 56,364.00 + 35% 208,350   418,400 ............. 121,505.25 + 39.6% 418,400 235,350 .......... 65,814.00 + 39.6% 235,350   Schedule Y-1—Use if your 2017 filing status was Married filing jointly or Qualifying widow(er) or you checked filing status box 6 on Form 1040NR Schedule Z—Use if your 2017 filing status was Head of household   If Schedule J, line 11, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 12 of the amount over— If Schedule J, line 11, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 12 of the amount over—   $0 $18,650 ...........   10% $0 $0 $13,350 ...........   10% $0   18,650 75,900 $1,865.00 + 15% 18,650 13,350 50,800 $1,335.00 + 15% 13,350   75,900 153,100 10,452.50 + 25% 75,900 50,800 131,200 6,952.50 + 25% 50,800   153,100 233,350 29,752.50 + 28% 153,100 131,200 212,500 27,052.50 + 28% 131,200   233,350 416,700 52,222.50 + 33% 233,350 212,500 416,700 49,816.50 + 33% 212,500   416,700 470,700 112,728.00 + 35% 416,700 416,700 444,550 117,202.50 + 35% 416,700   470,700 ............ 131,628.00 + 39.6% 470,700 444,550 ........... 126,950.00 + 39.6% 444,550         2017 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet—Line 12                        Use this worksheet only if both of the following apply.

Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use the Schedule D Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you had a capital gain excess. To find out if you had a capital gain excess, subtract the amount from your 2019 Schedule J, line 11, from line 6 of your 2017 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your 2017 Schedule D Tax Worksheet). If the result is more than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.   If you didn't have a capital gain excess, complete the rest of either of those worksheets according to the worksheet's instructions. Then complete lines 5 and 6 above.   If you had a capital gain excess, complete a second 2017 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or 2017 Schedule D Tax Worksheet (whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6 above. These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the 2017 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.   1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your 2017 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or line 9 of your 2017 Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.   2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 2 of your 2017 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or line 6 of your 2017 Schedule D Tax Worksheet by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1) above.   3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your 2017 Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.   4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your 2017 Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet in the 2017 Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).          Line 13 If you used Schedule J to figure your tax for 2018 (that is, you entered the amount from the 2018 Schedule J, line 23, on your 2018 Form 1040, line 11a; on your 2018 Form 1040NR, line 42; or on Form 1040X for 2018), enter on line 13 the amount from your 2018 Schedule J, line 3. If you didn't use Schedule J to figure your tax for 2018, enter on line 13 the taxable income from your 2018 tax return (or as previously adjusted by the IRS or corrected on an amended return). But if that amount is zero or less, complete the worksheet below to figure the amount to enter on line 13. If you didn't file a tax return for 2018, use the amount you would have reported as your taxable income had you been required to file a tax return. Be sure to keep all your records for 2018 until at least 3 years after April 15, 2020 (or the date you file your 2019 tax return, if later).       Instructions for 2018 Taxable Income Worksheet     Line 2. Any net capital loss deduction on your 2018 Schedule D, line 21, isn't allowed for income averaging purposes to the extent it didn't reduce your capital loss carryover to 2019. This could happen if the taxable income on your 2018 Form 1040, line 10, or your 2018 Form 1040NR, line 41 (or as previously adjusted) would have been less than zero if you could have entered a negative amount on that line. Enter on line 2 the amount by which your 2018 capital loss carryover to 2019 (the sum of your short- and long-term capital loss carryovers) exceeds the excess of the loss on your 2018 Schedule D, line 16, over the loss on your 2018 Schedule D, line 21.   Line 3. If you had an NOL for 2018, enter the amount of that NOL from the 2018 Form 1045, Schedule A, line 25, you filed with Form 1045 or Form 1040X. If you didn't have an NOL for 2018, enter the portion, if any, of the NOL carryovers and carrybacks to 2018 that weren't used in 2018 and were carried to years after 2018.     Example. John Farmington didn't use income averaging for 2016, 2017, or 2018. The taxable income on his 2018 Form 1040, line 10, would have been a negative $1,000 if he could have entered a negative number on that line. This amount includes an NOL deduction on his 2018 Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 21, of $1,100. The $1,100 is the portion of the 2017 NOL that was remaining from 2016 to be carried to 2018. See the examples earlier. John’s taxable income is limited to zero and he doesn’t have an NOL for 2018. The result is a negative $1,000, John's 2018 taxable income, which he enters as a positive amount on line 1 of the 2018 Taxable Income Worksheet. When John filed his 2018 tax return, he had a $3,000 net capital loss deduction on Schedule D, line 21 (which was also entered on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 13), a $7,000 loss on Schedule D, line 16, and a $5,000 capital loss carryover to 2019 (his 2018 capital loss carryover to 2019 was $5,000, not $4,000, because the amount on his Form 1040, line 10, would have been a negative $1,000 if he could have entered a negative number on that line). John adds the $3,000 from Schedule D, line 21, and the $5,000 carryover. He subtracts from the $8,000 result the $7,000 loss on his Schedule D, line 16, and enters $1,000 on line 2 of the worksheet. John enters -0- on line 3 of the worksheet because he doesn't have an NOL for 2018 and didn't have an NOL carryover from 2018 available to carry to 2019 and later years. The NOL deduction for 2018 of $1,100 was reduced to zero because it didn't exceed his modified taxable income of $3,100. Modified taxable income is figured by adding back the $3,000 net capital loss deduction to taxable income (figured without regard to the NOL deduction) of $100. John enters $1,000 on line 4 and $0 on line 5. He enters $0 on Schedule J, line 13. He enters $6,000 on Schedule J, line 14, and $6,000 on Schedule J, line 15. If he uses Schedule J to figure his tax for 2020, he will enter $6,000 on his 2020 Schedule J as his 2018 taxable income for income averaging purposes.     2018 Taxable Income Worksheet—Line 13              Complete this worksheet if your 2018 taxable income was zero or less. See the instructions above before completing this worksheet.   1. Figure the taxable income from your 2018 tax return (or as previously adjusted) without limiting it to zero. If you had an NOL for 2018, don't include any NOL carryovers or carrybacks to 2018. Enter the result as a positive amount 1.       2. If there is a loss on your 2018 Schedule D, line 21, add that loss (as a positive amount) and your 2018 capital loss carryover to 2019. Subtract from that sum the amount of the loss on your 2018 Schedule D, line 16, and enter the result 2.           3. If you had an NOL for 2018, enter it as a positive amount. Otherwise, enter as a positive amount the portion, if any, of the NOL carryovers and carrybacks to 2018 that weren't used in 2018 and were carried to years after 2018 3.           4. Add lines 2 and 3 4.       5. Subtract line 4 from line 1. Enter the result as a negative amount on Schedule J, line 13 5.                               Line 16 If line 15 is zero or less, enter -0- on line 16. Otherwise, figure the tax on the amount on line 15 using:    The 2018 Tax Rate Schedules below;   The 2018 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, later;   The 2018 Schedule D Tax Worksheet in the 2018 Schedule D instructions (but use the 2018 Tax Rate Schedules when figuring the tax on the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, lines 42 and 44); or   The 2018 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet, later.      If your elected farm income includes net capital gain, you must use the 2018 Schedule D Tax Worksheet to figure the tax on the amount on line 15. However, if you filed Form 2555 or 2555-EZ for 2018, you must first complete the 2018 Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet, and then use the 2018 Schedule D Tax Worksheet to figure the tax on the amount on line 3 of the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet. When completing the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, you must allocate 1/3 of the amount on Schedule J, line 2b (and 1/3 of the amount on line 2c, if any) to 2018. If for 2018 you had a capital loss that resulted in a capital loss carryover to 2019, don't reduce the elected farm income allocated to 2018 by any part of the carryover.       2018 Tax Rate Schedules—Line 16                      Schedule X—Use if your 2018 filing status was Single or you checked filing status box 1 or 2 on Form 1040NR Schedule Y-2—Use if your 2018 filing status was Married filing separately or you checked filing status box 3, 4, or 5 on Form 1040NR   If Schedule J, line 15, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 16 of the amount over— If Schedule J, line 15, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 16 of the amount over—   $0 $9,525 ...........   10% $0 $0 $9,525 ...........   10% $0   9,525 38,700 $952.50 + 12% 9,525 $9,525 38,700 $952.50 + 12% 9,525   38,700 82,500 4,453.50 + 22% 38,700 38,700 82,500 4,453.50 + 22% 38,700   82,500 157,500 14,089.50 + 24% 82,500 82,500 157,500 14,089.50 + 24% 82,500   157,500 200,000 32,089.50 + 32% 157,500 157,500 200,000 32,089.50 + 32% 157,500   200,000 500,000 45,689.50 + 35% 200,000 200,000 300,000 45,689.50 + 35% 200,000   500,000 ............. 150,689.50 + 37% 500,000 300,000 .......... 80,689.50 + 37% 300,000   Schedule Y-1—Use if your 2018 filing status was Married filing jointly or Qualifying widow(er) or you checked filing status box 6 on Form 1040NR Schedule Z—Use if your 2018 filing status was Head of household   If Schedule J, line 15, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 16 of the amount over— If Schedule J, line 15, is: Over— But not over— Enter on 			Schedule J, 			line 16 of the amount over—   $0 $19,050 ...........   10% $0 $0 $13,600 ...........   10% $0   19,050 77,400 $1,905.00 + 12% 19,050 13,600 51,800 $1,360.00 + 12% 13,600   77,400 165,000 8,907.00 + 22% 77,400 51,800 82,500 5,944.00 + 22% 51,800   165,000 315,000 28,179.00 + 24% 165,000 82,500 157,500 12,698.00 + 24% 82,500   315,000 400,000 64,179.00 + 32% 315,000 157,500 200,000 30,698.00 + 32% 157,500   400,000 600,000 91,379.00 + 35% 400,000 200,000 500,000 44,298.00 + 35% 200,000   600,000 ............ 161,379.00 + 37% 600,000 500,000 ........... 149,298.00 + 37% 500,000         2018 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet—Line 16                        Use this worksheet only if both of the following apply.

Do not file it with your tax return unless you are specifically required to do so. (See the instructions for Code O. Backup withholding, later.) The partnership files a copy of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) with the IRS. For your protection, Schedule K-1 may show only the last four digits of your identifying number (social security number (SSN), etc.). However, the partnership has reported your complete identifying number to the IRS. Although the partnership generally isn't subject to income tax, you may be liable for tax on your share of the partnership income, whether or not distributed. Include your share on your tax return if a return is required. Use these instructions to help you report the items shown on Schedule K-1 on your tax return. The amount of loss and deduction you may claim on your tax return may be less than the amount reported on Schedule K-1. It is the partner's responsibility to consider and apply any applicable limitations. See Limitations on Losses, Deductions, and Credits, later, for more information.     Inconsistent Treatment of Items If you are a partner in a partnership that has not elected out of the centralized partnership audit regime enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), you must report the items shown on your Schedule K-1 (and any attached statements) the same way that the partnership treated the items on its return. If the treatment on your original or amended return is inconsistent with the partnership's treatment, or if the partnership was required to but has not filed a return, you must file Form 8082, Notice of Inconsistent Treatment or Administrative Adjustment Request (AAR), with your original or amended return to identify and explain any inconsistency (or to note that a partnership return has not been filed). If you are required to file Form 8082 but do not do so, you may be subject to the accuracy-related penalty. This penalty is in addition to any tax that results from making your amount or treatment of the item consistent with that shown on the partnership's return. Any deficiency that results from making the amounts consistent may be assessed immediately.     Errors If you believe the partnership has made an error on your Schedule K-1, notify the partnership and ask for a corrected Schedule K-1. Do not change any items on your copy of Schedule K-1. Be sure that the partnership sends a copy of the corrected Schedule K-1 to the IRS.     Sale or Exchange of Partnership Interest Generally, a partner who sells or exchanges a partnership interest in a section 751(a) exchange must notify the partnership, in writing, within 30 days of the exchange (or, if earlier, by January 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the exchange occurred). A ""section 751(a) exchange"" is any sale or exchange of a partnership interest in which any money or other property received by the partner in exchange for that partner's interest is attributable to unrealized receivables (as defined in section 751(c)) or inventory items (as defined in section 751(d)). The written notice to the partnership must include the names and addresses of both parties to the exchange, the identifying numbers of the transferor and (if known) of the transferee, and the exchange date. An exception to this rule is made for sales or exchanges of publicly traded partnership interests for which a broker is required to file Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions. If a partner is required to notify the partnership of a section 751(a) exchange but fails to do so, the partner will be subject to a penalty for each such failure. However, no penalty will be imposed if the partner can show that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.    Gain or loss from the disposition of your partnership interest may be net investment income under section 1411 and could be subject to the net investment income tax. See Form 8960, Net Investment Income Tax—Individuals, Estates, and Trusts, and its instructions for information about how to report and figure the tax due.    Three-year holding period requirement for applicable partnership interests. Section 1061 increases the required long-term capital gains holding period for an applicable partnership interest from more than 1 year to more than 3 years. The holding period applies only to applicable partnership interests held in connection with the performance of services as defined in section 1061. See section 1061 and Pub. 541 for details.     Nominee Reporting Any person who holds, directly or indirectly, an interest in a partnership as a nominee for another person must furnish a written statement to the partnership by the last day of the month following the end of the partnership's tax year. This statement must include the name, address, and identifying number of the nominee and such other person, description of the partnership interest held as nominee for that person, and other information required by Temporary Regulations section 1.6031(c)-1T. A nominee that fails to furnish this statement must furnish to the person for whom the nominee holds the partnership interest a copy of Schedule K-1 and related information within 30 days of receiving it from the partnership. A nominee who fails to furnish all the information required by Temporary Regulations section 1.6031(c)-1T when due, or who furnishes incorrect information, is subject to a $270 penalty for each failure. The maximum penalty is $3,339,000 for all such failures during a calendar year. If the nominee intentionally disregards the requirement to report correct information, each $270 penalty increases to $550 or, if greater, 10% of the aggregate amount of items required to be reported, and there is no limit to the amount of the penalty.     International Boycotts Every partnership that had operations in, or related to, a boycotting country, company, or a national of a boycotting country must file Form 5713, International Boycott Report. If the partnership cooperated with an international boycott, it must give you a copy of its Form 5713. You must file your own Form 5713 to report the partnership's activities and any other boycott operations that you may have. You may lose certain tax benefits if the partnership participated in, or cooperated with, an international boycott. See Form 5713 and its instructions for more information.     Definitions    General Partner A general partner is a partner who is personally liable for partnership debts.     Limited Partner A limited partner is a partner in a partnership formed under a state limited partnership law, whose personal liability for partnership debts is limited to the amount of money or other property that the partner contributed or is required to contribute to the partnership. Some members of other entities, such as domestic or foreign business trusts or limited liability companies that are classified as partnerships, may be treated as limited partners for certain purposes.     Nonrecourse Loans Nonrecourse loans are those liabilities of the partnership for which no partner or related person bears the economic risk of loss.      Elections Generally, the partnership decides how to figure taxable income from its operations. However, certain elections are made by you separately on your income tax return and not by the partnership. These elections are made under the following code sections.    Section 59(e) (deduction of certain qualified expenditures ratably over the period of time specified in that section). For details, see the instructions for code J in box 13.   Section 108(b)(5) (election related to reduction of tax attributes due to exclusion from gross income of discharge of indebtedness).   Section 263A(d) (preproductive expenses). See the instructions for code P in box 13.   Section 617 (deduction and recapture of certain mining exploration expenditures).   Section 901 (foreign tax credit).          Additional Information For more information on the treatment of partnership income, deductions, credits, and other items, see Pub. 535, Business Expenses. To get forms and publications, see the instructions for your tax return or visit the IRS website at IRS.gov.     Limitations on Losses, Deductions, and Credits There are potential limitations on partnership losses that you can deduct on your return. These limitations and the order in which you must apply them are as follows: the basis limitations, the at-risk limitations, the passive activity limitations, and the excess business loss limitations. These limitations are discussed below. Other limitations may apply to specific deductions (for example, the section 179 expense deduction). Generally, specific limitations apply before the at-risk and passive loss limitations.    Basis Limitations Generally, you may not claim your share of a partnership loss (including a capital loss) to the extent that it is greater than the adjusted basis of your partnership interest at the end of the partnership's tax year. Any losses and deductions not allowed this year because of the basis limit can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in a later year subject to the basis limit for that year. The partnership isn't responsible for keeping the information needed to figure the basis of your partnership interest. Although the partnership does provide an analysis of the changes to your capital account in item L of Schedule K-1, that information is based on the partnership's books and records and cannot be used to figure your basis. You can figure the adjusted basis of your partnership interest by adding items that increase your basis and then subtracting items that decrease your basis. Use the Worksheet for Adjusting the Basis of a Partner’s Interest in the Partnership to figure the basis of your interest in the partnership. For partnership tax years beginning after 2017, a partner's share of the adjusted basis in partnership charitable contributions (defined in section 170(c)) and taxes, described in section 901, paid or accrued to foreign countries and to possessions of the United States are subject to this basis limitation (defined in section 704(d)). For more details on the basis limitations, and special rules for charitable contributions and foreign taxes paid and accrued, see Pub. 541, Partnerships.      Worksheet for Adjusting the Basis of a Partner's Interest in the Partnership           1. Your adjusted basis at the end of the prior year. Do not enter less than zero. Enter -0- if this is your first tax year 1.       Increases:   2. Money and your adjusted basis in property contributed to the partnership less the associated liabilities (but not less than zero) 2.     3. Your increased share of or assumption of partnership liabilities. (Subtract your share of liabilities shown in item K of your 2018 Schedule K-1 from your share of liabilities shown in item K of your 2019 Schedule K-1 and add the amount of any partnership liabilities you assumed during the tax year (but not less than zero)) 3.     4. Your share of the partnership's income or gain (including tax-exempt income) reduced by any amount included in interest income with respect to the credit to holders of clean renewable energy bonds 4.     5. Any gain recognized this year on contributions of property. Do not include gain from transfer of liabilities 5.     6. Your share of the excess of the deductions for depletion (other than oil and gas depletion) over the basis of the property subject to depletion 6.       Decreases:   7. Withdrawals and distributions of money and the adjusted basis of property distributed to you from the partnership. Do not include the amount of property distributions included in the partner's income (taxable income) 7.       Caution: A distribution may be taxable if the amount exceeds your adjusted basis of your partnership interest immediately before the distribution.       8. Your decreased share of partnership liabilities and any decrease in your individual liabilities because they were assumed by the partnership. (Subtract your share of liabilities shown in item K of your 2019 Schedule K-1 from your share of liabilities shown in item K of your 2018 Schedule K-1 and add the amount of your individual liabilities that the partnership assumed during the tax year (but not less than zero)) 8.     9. Your share of the partnership's nondeductible expenses that are not capital expenditures 9.     10. Your share of the partnership's losses and deductions (including capital losses). However, include your share of the partnership's section 179 expense deduction for this year even if you cannot deduct all of it because of limitations 10.     11. The amount of your deduction for depletion of any partnership oil and gas property, not to exceed your allocable share of the adjusted basis of that property 11.     12. Your adjusted basis in the partnership at the end of this tax year. (Add lines 1 through 6 and subtract lines 7 through 11 from the total. If zero or less, enter -0-.) 12.       Caution: The deduction for your share of the partnership's losses and deductions is limited to your adjusted basis in your partnership interest. If you entered zero on line 12 and the amount figured for line 12 was less than zero, a portion of your share of the partnership losses and deductions may not be deductible. (See Basis Limitations, earlier, for more information.)             At-Risk Limitations Generally, if you have (a) a loss or other deduction from any activity carried on as a trade or business or for the production of income by the partnership, and (b) amounts in the activity for which you are not at risk, you will have to complete Form 6198, At-Risk Limitations, to figure your allowable loss for the activity. The at-risk rules generally limit the amount of loss and other deductions that you can claim to the amount you could actually lose in the activity. These losses and deductions include a loss on the disposition of assets and the section 179 expense deduction. However, if you acquired your partnership interest before 1987, the at-risk rules do not apply to losses from an activity of holding real property placed in service before 1987 by the partnership. The activity of holding mineral property doesn't qualify for this exception. The partnership should identify on a statement attached to Schedule K-1 any losses that are not subject to the at-risk limitations. Generally, you are not at risk for amounts such as the following.    Nonrecourse loans used to finance the activity, to acquire property used in the activity, or to acquire your interest in the activity that are not secured by your own property (other than the property used in the activity). See the instructions for item K, later, for the exception for qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property.   Cash, property, or borrowed amounts used in the activity (or contributed to the activity, or used to acquire your interest in the activity) that are protected against loss by a guarantee, stop-loss agreement, or other similar arrangement (excluding casualty insurance and insurance against tort liability).   Amounts borrowed for use in the activity from a person who has an interest in the activity, other than as a creditor, or who is related, under section 465(b)(3), to a person (other than you) having such an interest.      You should get a separate statement of income, expenses, and other items for each activity from the partnership.  Note. Box 21 in Part III of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) will be checked when a statement is attached.        Passive Activity Limitations Section 469 provides rules that limit the deduction of certain losses and credits. These rules apply to partners who:    Are individuals, estates, trusts, closely held C corporations, or personal service corporations; and   Have a passive activity loss or credit for the tax year.      Generally, passive activities include the following.    Trade or business activities in which you didn't materially participate.   Activities that meet the definition of rental activities under Temporary Regulations section 1.469-1T(e)(3) and Regulations section 1.469-1(e)(3).      Passive activities do not include the following.    Trade or business activities in which you materially participated.   Rental real estate activities in which you materially participated if you were a real estate professional for the tax year. You were a real estate professional only if you met both of the following conditions.    More than half of the personal services you performed in trades or businesses were performed in real property trades or businesses in which you materially participated.   You performed more than 750 hours of services in real property trades or businesses in which you materially participated.       For a closely held C corporation (defined in section 465(a)(1)(B)), the above conditions are treated as met if more than 50% of the corporation's gross receipts were from real property trades or businesses in which the corporation materially participated. For purposes of this rule, each interest in rental real estate is a separate activity, unless you elect to treat all interests in rental real estate as one activity. For details on making this election, see the Instructions for Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), Supplemental Income and Loss. If you are married filing jointly, either you or your spouse must separately meet both (a) and (b) of the above conditions, without taking into account services performed by the other spouse. A real property trade or business is any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business. Services you performed as an employee are not treated as performed in a real property trade or business unless you owned more than 5% of the stock (or more than 5% of the capital or profits interest) in the employer.   Working interests in oil or gas wells if you were a general partner.   The rental of a dwelling unit any partner used for personal purposes during the year for more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the number of days that the residence was rented at fair rental value.   Activities of trading personal property for the account of owners of interests in the activities.      If you are an individual, an estate, or a trust, and you have a passive activity loss or credit, use Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations, to figure your allowable passive losses and Form 8582-CR, Passive Activity Credit Limitations, to figure your allowable passive credits. For a corporation, use Form 8810, Corporate Passive Activity Loss and Credit Limitations. See the instructions for these forms for details. If the partnership had more than one activity, it will attach a statement to your Schedule K-1 that identifies each activity (trade or business activity, rental real estate activity, rental activity other than rental real estate, and other activity) and specifies the income (loss), deductions, and credits from each activity.  Note. Box 22 in Part III of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) will be checked when a statement is attached.     Material participation. You must determine if you materially participated (a) in each trade or business activity held through the partnership, and (b) if you were a real estate professional (defined earlier) in each rental real estate activity held through the partnership. All determinations of material participation are based on your participation during the partnership's tax year.  Material participation standards for partners who are individuals are listed below. Special rules apply to certain retired or disabled farmers and to the surviving spouses of farmers. See the Instructions for Form 8582 for details.  Corporations should refer to the Instructions for Form 8810 for the material participation standards that apply to them.     Individuals (other than limited partners). If you are an individual (either a general partner or a limited partner who owned a general partnership interest at all times during the tax year), you materially participated in an activity only if one or more of the following apply.     You participated in the activity for more than 500 hours during the tax year.    Your participation in the activity for the tax year constituted substantially all the participation in the activity of all individuals (including individuals who are not owners of interests in the activity).    You participated in the activity for more than 100 hours during the tax year, and your participation in the activity for the tax year wasn't less than the participation in the activity of any other individual (including individuals who were not owners of interests in the activity) for the tax year.    The activity was a significant participation activity for the tax year, and you participated in all significant participation activities (including activities outside the partnership) during the year for more than 500 hours. A significant participation activity is any trade or business activity in which you participated for more than 100 hours during the year and in which you didn't materially participate under any of the material participation tests (other than this test).    You materially participated in the activity for any 5 tax years (whether or not consecutive) during the 10 tax years that immediately precede the tax year.    The activity was a personal service activity and you materially participated in the activity for any 3 tax years (whether or not consecutive) preceding the tax year. A personal service activity involves the performance of personal services in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, or any other trade or business in which capital isn't a material income-producing factor.    Based on all the facts and circumstances, you participated in the activity on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis during the tax year.           Limited partners. If you are a limited partner, you do not materially participate in an activity unless you meet one of the tests in paragraph 1, 5, or 6 above.      Work counted toward material participation. Generally, any work that you or your spouse does in connection with an activity held through a partnership (where you own your partnership interest at the time the work is done) is counted toward material participation. However, work in connection with the activity isn't counted toward material participation if either of the following applies.     The work isn't the type of work that owners of the activity would usually do and one of the principal purposes of the work that you or your spouse does is to avoid the passive loss or credit limitations.    You do the work in your capacity as an investor and you are not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the activity. Examples of work done as an investor that would not count toward material participation include:     Studying and reviewing financial statements or reports on operations of the activity,    Preparing or compiling summaries or analyses of the finances or operations of the activity for your own use, and    Monitoring the finances or operations of the activity in a non-managerial capacity.              Effect of determination. Income (loss), deductions, and credits from an activity are nonpassive if you determine that:     You materially participated in a trade or business activity of the partnership, or    You were a real estate professional (defined earlier) in a rental real estate activity of the partnership.       If you determine that you didn't materially participate in a trade or business activity of the partnership or if you have income (loss), deductions, or credits from a rental activity of the partnership (other than a rental real estate activity in which you materially participated as a real estate professional), the amounts from that activity are passive. Report passive income (losses), deductions, and credits as follows.     If you have an overall gain (the excess of income over deductions and losses, including any prior year unallowed loss) from a passive activity, report the income, deductions, and losses from the activity as indicated in these instructions.   If you have an overall loss (the excess of deductions and losses, including any prior year unallowed loss, over income) or credits from a passive activity, report the income, deductions, losses, and credits from all passive activities using the Instructions for Form 8582 or the Instructions for Form 8582-CR (or Form 8810), to see if your deductions, losses, and credits are limited under the passive activity rules.          Publicly traded partnerships (PTP). The passive activity limitations are applied separately for items (other than the low-income housing credit and the rehabilitation credit) from each PTP. Thus, a net passive loss from a PTP may not be deducted from other passive income. Instead, a passive loss from a PTP is suspended and carried forward to be applied against passive income from the same PTP in later years. If the partner's entire interest in the PTP is completely disposed of, any unused losses are allowed in full in the year of disposition.  If you have an overall gain from a PTP, the net gain is nonpassive income. In addition, the nonpassive income is included in investment income to figure your investment interest expense deduction.  Do not report passive income, gains, or losses from a PTP on Form 8582. Instead, use the following rules to figure and report on the proper form or schedule your income, gains, and losses from passive activities that you held through each PTP you owned during the tax year.     Combine any current year income, gains, and losses, and any prior year unallowed losses to see if you have an overall gain or loss from the PTP. Include only the same types of income and losses you would include in your net income or loss from a non-PTP passive activity. See Pub. 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules, for more details.    If you have an overall gain, the net gain portion (total gain minus total losses) is nonpassive income. On the form or schedule you normally use, report the net gain portion as nonpassive income and the remaining income and the total losses as passive income and loss. To the left of the entry space, enter ""From PTP."" It is important to identify the nonpassive income because the nonpassive portion is included in modified adjusted gross income for purposes of figuring on Form 8582 the ""special allowance"" for active participation in a non-PTP rental real estate activity. In addition, the nonpassive income is included in investment income when figuring your investment interest expense deduction on Form 4952, Investment Interest Expense Deduction.  Example. If you have Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) income of $8,000, and a Form 4797, Sales of Business Property, prior year unallowed loss of $3,500 from the passive activities of a particular PTP, you have a $4,500 overall gain ($8,000 − $3,500). On Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, report the $4,500 net gain as nonpassive income in column (k). In column (h), report the remaining Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) gain of $3,500 ($8,000 − $4,500). On the appropriate line of Form 4797, report the prior year unallowed loss of $3,500. Be sure to enter ""From PTP"" to the left of each entry space.     If you have an overall loss (but didn't dispose of your entire interest in the PTP to an unrelated person in a fully taxable transaction during the year), the losses are allowed to the extent of the income, and the excess loss is carried forward to use in a future year when you have income to offset it. Report as a passive loss on the schedule or form you normally use the portion of the loss equal to the income. Report the income as passive income on the form or schedule you normally use.   Example. You have a Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) loss of $12,000 (current year losses plus prior year unallowed losses) and a Form 4797 gain of $7,200. Report the $7,200 gain on the appropriate line of Form 4797. On Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, report $7,200 of the losses as a passive loss in column (g). Carry forward to 2019 the unallowed loss of $4,800 ($12,000 − $7,200).  If you have unallowed losses from more than one activity of the PTP or from the same activity of the PTP that must be reported on different forms, you must allocate the unallowed losses on a pro rata basis to figure the amount allowed from each activity or on each form.      To allocate and keep a record of the unallowed losses, use Worksheets 5, 6, and 7 of Form 8582. List each activity of the PTP in Worksheet 5. Enter the overall loss from each activity in column (a). Complete column (b) of Worksheet 5 according to its instructions. Multiply the total unallowed loss from the PTP by each ratio in column (b) and enter the result in column (c) of Worksheet 5. Then, complete Worksheet 6 if all the loss from the same activity is to be reported on one form or schedule. Use Worksheet 7 instead of Worksheet 6 if you have more than one loss to be reported on different forms or schedules for the same activity. Enter the net loss plus any prior year unallowed losses in column (a) of Worksheet 6 (or Worksheet 7, if applicable). The losses in column (c) of Worksheet 6 (column (e) of Worksheet 7) are the allowed losses to report on the forms or schedules. Report both these losses and any income from the PTP on the forms and schedules you normally use.    If you have an overall loss and you disposed of your entire interest in the PTP to an unrelated person in a fully taxable transaction during the year, your losses (including prior year unallowed losses) allocable to the activity for the year are not limited by the passive loss rules. A fully taxable transaction is one in which you recognize all your realized gain or loss. Report the income and losses on the forms and schedules you normally use.     For rules on the disposition of an entire interest reported using the installment method, see the Instructions for Form 8582.         Special allowance for a rental real estate activity. If you actively participated in a rental real estate activity, you may be able to deduct up to $25,000 of the loss from the activity from nonpassive income. This ""special allowance"" is an exception to the general rule disallowing losses in excess of income from passive activities. The special allowance isn't available if you were married, file a separate return for the year, and didn't live apart from your spouse at all times during the year.  Only individuals, qualifying estates, and qualifying revocable trusts that made a section 645 election can actively participate in a rental real estate activity. Estates (other than qualifying estates), trusts (other than qualifying revocable trusts that made a section 645 election), and corporations cannot actively participate. Limited partners cannot actively participate unless future regulations provide an exception.  You are not considered to actively participate in a rental real estate activity if, at any time during the tax year, your interest (including your spouse's interest) in the activity was less than 10% (by value) of all interests in the activity.  Active participation is a less stringent requirement than material participation. You may be treated as actively participating if you participated, for example, in making management decisions or arranging for others to provide services (such as repairs) in a significant and bona fide sense. Management decisions that can count as active participation include approving new tenants, deciding rental terms, approving capital or repair expenditures, and other similar decisions.  An estate is a qualifying estate if the decedent would have satisfied the active participation requirement for the activity for the tax year the decedent died. A qualifying estate is treated as actively participating for tax years ending less than 2 years after the date of the decedent's death.     Modified adjusted gross income limitation. The maximum special allowance that single individuals and married individuals filing a joint return can qualify for is $25,000. The maximum is $12,500 for married individuals who file separate returns and who lived apart at all times during the year. The maximum special allowance for which an estate can qualify is $25,000 reduced by the special allowance for which the surviving spouse qualifies.  If your modified adjusted gross income (defined below) is $100,000 or less ($50,000 or less if married filing separately), your loss is deductible up to the maximum special allowance referred to in the preceding paragraph. If your modified adjusted gross income is more than $100,000 (more than $50,000 if married filing separately), the special allowance is limited to 50% of the difference between $150,000 ($75,000 if married filing separately) and your modified adjusted gross income. When modified adjusted gross income is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if married filing separately), there is no special allowance.  Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income figured without taking into account the following amounts, if applicable.     Any passive activity loss.    Any rental real estate loss allowed under section 469(c)(7) to real estate professionals (defined earlier).    Any overall loss from a PTP.    Any taxable social security or equivalent railroad retirement benefits.    Any deductible contributions to an IRA or certain other qualified retirement plans under section 219.    The domestic production activities deduction.    The student loan interest deduction.    The tuition and fees deduction.    The deductible part of self-employment taxes.    The exclusion from income of interest from Series EE or I U.S. Savings Bonds used to pay higher education expenses.    The exclusion of amounts received under an employer's adoption assistance program.           Commercial revitalization deduction. The special $25,000 allowance for the commercial revitalization deduction from rental real estate activities isn't subject to the active participation rules or modified adjusted gross income limits discussed earlier. See section 469(i)(3)(C) as in effect before March 23, 2018, and the instructions for box 13, code Q, for more information.     Special rules for certain other activities. If you have net income (loss), deductions, or credits from any activity to which special rules apply, the partnership will identify the activity and all amounts relating to it on Schedule K-1 or on an attached statement.  If you have net income subject to recharacterization under Temporary Regulations section 1.469-2T(f) and Regulations section 1.469-2(f), report such amounts according to the Instructions for Form 8582 (or Form 8810).  If you have net income (loss), deductions, or credits from any of the following activities, treat such amounts as nonpassive and report them as indicated in these instructions.     Working interests in oil and gas wells if you are a general partner.    The rental of a dwelling unit any partner used for personal purposes during the year for more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the number of days that the residence was rented at fair rental value.    Trading personal property for the account of owners of interests in the activity.         Self-charged interest. The partnership will report any ""self-charged"" interest income or expense that resulted from loans between you and the partnership (or between the partnership and another partnership or S corporation if both entities have the same owners with the same proportional ownership interest in each entity). If there was more than one activity, the partnership will provide a statement allocating the interest income or expense with respect to each activity. The self-charged interest rules do not apply to your partnership interest if the partnership made an election under Regulations section 1.469-7(g) to avoid the application of these rules. See the Instructions for Form 8582 for details.       Excess Business Loss Limitations Losses attributable to your trade or business may be limited pursuant to section 461. See section 461 and Form 461 and its instructions for more information.       Specific Instructions      Part I. Information About the Partnership    Item D If the box in item D is checked, you are a partner in a PTP and must follow the rules discussed earlier under Publicly traded partnerships.      Part II. Information About the Partner    Item E If the partner is an individual, the partnership will enter the partner's social security number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). For all other partners, the partnership will enter the partner's EIN. However, if the partner is an IRA, the partnership will enter the identifying number of the custodian of the IRA. In the case of a DE, the partnership will enter the TIN of the beneficial owner of the DE in Item E and the beneficial owner's address in Item F. For your protection, this form may show only the last four digits of the TIN in Items E and H2, as noted under Purpose of Schedule K-1, above. However, the partnership has reported your complete identification number to the IRS.     Item H2 If the partner is a DE, such as a single member LLC that did not elect to be treated as a corporation, the partnership will check the DE box and enter the name and TIN of the DE.     Item J Generally, the amounts reported in item J are based on the partnership agreement. If your interest commenced after the beginning of the partnership's tax year, the partnership will have entered, in the Beginning column, the percentages that existed for you immediately after admission. If your interest terminated before the end of the partnership's tax year, the partnership will have entered, in the Ending column, the percentages that existed immediately before termination. The ending percentage share shown on the Capital line is the portion of the capital you would receive if the partnership was liquidated at the end of its tax year by the distribution of undivided interests in the partnership's assets and liabilities. If your capital account is negative or zero, the partnership will have entered zero on this line. The box ""Check if decrease is due to sale or exchange of partnership interest"" will be checked if you sold or exchanged all or part of your partnership interest to a new or pre-existing partner during this tax year, regardless of whether you recognized gain or loss on the transaction(s). You may have realized a gain or loss on the transfer or disposition of your interest. See codes AB, AC, and AD on line 20 for items that have special gain or loss treatment. For more information, see Disposition of a Partner's Interest and Partnership Distributions in Pub 541.     Item K Item K should show your share of the partnership's nonrecourse liabilities, partnership-level qualified nonrecourse financing, and other recourse liabilities at the beginning and the end of the partnership's tax year. If you terminated your interest in the partnership during the tax year, item K should show the share that existed immediately before the total disposition. A partner's ""recourse liability"" is any partnership liability for which a partner is personally liable. If this partnership invested in other partnerships, item K will include your share of partnership liabilities from those other partnerships, except to the extent the liabilities from those other partnerships are owed to this partnership. Use the total of the three amounts for figuring the adjusted basis of your partnership interest. Generally, you may use only the amounts shown next to ""Qualified nonrecourse financing"" and ""Recourse"" to figure your amount at risk. Do not include any amounts that are not at risk if such amounts are included in either of these categories. If your partnership is engaged in two or more different types of activities subject to the at-risk provisions, or a combination of at-risk activities and any other activity, the partnership should give you a statement showing your share of nonrecourse liabilities, partnership-level qualified nonrecourse financing, and other recourse liabilities for each activity. Qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property used in an activity of holding real property that is subject to the at-risk rules is treated as an amount at risk. Qualified nonrecourse financing generally includes financing for which no one is personally liable for repayment that is borrowed for use in an activity of holding real property and that is loaned or guaranteed by a federal, state, or local government or borrowed from a ""qualified"" person. Qualified persons include any persons actively and regularly engaged in the business of lending money, such as a bank or savings and loan association. Qualified persons generally do not include related parties (unless the nonrecourse financing is commercially reasonable and on substantially the same terms as loans involving unrelated persons), the seller of the property, or a person who receives a fee for the partnership's investment in the real property. See Pub. 925 for more information on qualified nonrecourse financing. Both the partnership and you must meet the qualified nonrecourse rules on this debt before you can include the amount shown next to ""Qualified nonrecourse financing"" in your at-risk computation. See Limitations on Losses, Deductions, and Credits, earlier, for more information on the at-risk limitations.     Item L If a partnership reports other than tax basis capital accounts to its partners on Schedule K-1 in item L (that is, GAAP, 704(b) book, or other), and tax basis capital, if reported on any partner's Schedule K-1 at the beginning or end of the tax year would be negative, the partnership must report on line 20 of Schedule K-1, using code AH, such partner's beginning and ending shares of tax basis capital. This is in addition to the required reporting in item L of Schedule K-1. The partnership will report the capital accounts for 2019 using any of the bases which were allowable for 2018. See Notice 2019-66. See frequently asked questions, Negative Tax Basis Capital Account Reporting Requirements, at IRS.gov/Form1065.     Item M If you have contributed property with a built-in gain or loss during the tax year, the partnership will check the ""Yes"" box. Also, the partnership will attach a statement showing the property contributed, the date of the contribution, and the amount of any built-in gain or loss. A built-in gain or loss is the difference between the fair market value of the property and your adjusted basis in the property at the time it was contributed to the partnership. If you contributed more than 10 properties on a single date during the tax year, the statement may instead show the number of properties contributed on that date, the total amount of built-in gain, and the total amount of built-in loss. The partnership is providing this for your information. Contributions of property with a built-in gain or loss could affect a partner's tax liability (in matters concerning precontribution gain or loss, and distributions subject to section 737), and may also affect how the partnership allocated certain items on your Schedule K-1. For information on precontribution gain or loss, see the instructions for box 20, code W. For information on distributions subject to section 737, see the instructions for box 19, code B.     Item N If you are allocated a share of section 704(c) gain or loss, the partnership will report your net unrecognized section 704(c) gain or loss both at the beginning and at the end of the partnership's tax year in item N. The partnership can use any reasonable method in reporting net unrecognized section 704(c) built-in gain or loss to you. You will be allocated unrecognized section 704(c) gain or loss if:    You contributed property with fair market value in excess of adjusted tax basis (built-in gain property);   You contributed property with fair market value less than adjusted tax basis (built-in loss property); or   The partnership elected, under certain circumstances, to revalue property (book-up or book-down) on its books to reflect changes in the fair market value of such property. These revaluations are sometimes referred to as reverse section 704(c) allocations.      The partnership is providing this for your information. If the partnership disposes of the property or there are special allocations due to depreciation, depletion, or amortization, the partnership will report these items on other parts of Schedule K-1.  Note. Although the partnership is reporting the beginning and ending balance on an aggregate net basis, it is generally required to keep records of this information on a property-by-property basis.  These rules do not apply to publicly traded partnerships, and their partners, for 2019 partnership tax years, and thereafter, until further notice.      Part III. Partner's Share of Current Year Income, Deductions, Credits, and Other Items The amounts shown in boxes 1 through 20 reflect your share of income, loss, deductions, credits, and other items from partnership business or rental activities without reference to limitations on losses or adjustments that may be required of you because of:    The adjusted basis of your partnership interest,   The amount for which you are at risk, and   The passive activity limitations.      For information on these provisions, see Limitations on Losses, Deductions, and Credits, earlier. Other limitations may apply to specific deductions (for example, the section 179 expense deduction). Generally, specific limitations apply before the at-risk and passive loss limitations. If you are an individual and the passive activity rules do not apply to the amounts shown on your Schedule K-1, take the amounts shown and enter them on the lines on your tax return as indicated in the summarized reporting information shown on page 2 of the Schedule K-1. If the passive activity rules do apply, report the amounts shown as indicated in these instructions. If you are not an individual, report the amounts in each box as instructed on your tax return. The line numbers in the summarized reporting information on page 2 of Schedule K-1 are references to forms in use for calendar year 2019. If you file your tax return on a calendar year basis, but your partnership files a return for a fiscal year, report the amounts on your tax return for the year in which the partnership's fiscal year ends. For example, if the partnership's tax year ends in February 2020, report the amounts on your 2020 tax return. If you have losses, deductions, or credits from a prior year that were not deductible or usable because of certain limitations, such as the basis limitations or the at-risk limitations, take them into account in determining your net income, loss, or credits for this year. However, except for passive activity losses and credits, do not combine the prior year amounts with any amounts shown on this Schedule K-1 to get a net figure to report on any supporting schedules, statements, or forms attached to your return. Instead, report the amounts on the attached schedule, statement, or form on a year-by-year basis. If the partnership reports a section 743(b) adjustment to partnership items, report these adjustments as separate items on Form 1040 or 1040-SR in accordance with the reporting instructions for the partnership item being adjusted. A section 743(b) adjustment increases or decreases your share of income, deduction, gain, or loss for a partnership item. For example, if the partnership reports a section 743(b) adjustment to depreciation for property used in its trade or business, report the adjustment on line 28 of Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) in accordance with the instructions for box 1 of Schedule K-1.    If you have amounts other than those shown on Schedule K-1 to report on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), enter each item separately on line 28 of Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).  Codes. In box 11 and boxes 13 through 20, the partnership will identify each item by entering a code in the column to the left of the dollar amount entry space. These codes are identified on page 2 of Schedule K-1 and in these instructions.    Attached statements. The partnership will enter an asterisk (*) after the code, if any, in the column to the left of the dollar amount entry space for each item for which it has attached a statement providing additional information. For those informational items that cannot be reported as a single dollar amount, the partnership will enter an asterisk in the left column and enter ""STMT"" in the dollar amount entry space to indicate the information is provided on an attached statement.       Income (Loss)    Box 1. Ordinary Business Income (Loss) The amount reported in box 1 is your share of the ordinary income (loss) from trade or business activities of the partnership. Generally, where you report this amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR depends on whether the amount is from an activity that is a passive activity to you. If you are an individual partner filing a 2019 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, find your situation below and report your box 1 income (loss) as instructed, after applying the basis and at-risk limitations on losses. If the partnership had more than one trade or business activity, it will attach a statement identifying the income or loss from each activity.    Report box 1 income (loss) from partnership trade or business activities in which you materially participated on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (i) or (k).   Report box 1 income (loss) from partnership trade or business activities in which you didn't materially participate, as follows.    If income is reported in box 1, report the income on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (h). However, if the box in item D is checked, report the income following the rules for Publicly traded partnerships, earlier.   If a loss is reported in box 1, follow the Instructions for Form 8582 to figure how much of the loss can be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (g). However, if the box in item D is checked, report the loss following the rules for Publicly traded partnerships, earlier.             Box 2. Net Rental Real Estate Income (Loss) Generally, the income (loss) reported in box 2 is a passive activity amount for all partners. However, the income (loss) in box 2 isn't from a passive activity if you were a real estate professional (defined earlier) and you materially participated in the activity. If the partnership had more than one rental real estate activity, it will attach a statement identifying the income or loss from each activity. If you are filing a 2019 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, use the following instructions to determine where to report a box 2 amount.    If you have a loss from a passive activity in box 2 and you meet all the following conditions, report the loss on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (g).    You actively participated in the partnership rental real estate activities. See Special allowance for a rental real estate activity, earlier.   Rental real estate activities with active participation were your only passive activities.   You have no prior year unallowed losses from these activities.   Your total loss from the rental real estate activities wasn't more than $25,000 (not more than $12,500 if married filing separately and you lived apart from your spouse all year).   If you are a married person filing separately, you lived apart from your spouse all year.   You have no current or prior year unallowed credits from a passive activity.   Your modified adjusted gross income wasn't more than $100,000 (not more than $50,000 if married filing separately and you lived apart from your spouse all year).   Your interest in the rental real estate activity wasn't held as a limited partner.      If you have a loss from a passive activity in box 2 and you do not meet all the conditions in (1) above, follow the Instructions for Form 8582 to figure how much of the loss you can report on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (g). However, if the box in item D is checked, report the loss following the rules for Publicly traded partnerships, earlier.   If you were a real estate professional and you materially participated in the activity, report box 2 income (loss) on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (i) or (k).   If you have income from a passive activity in box 2, report the income on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (h). However, if the box in item D is checked, report the income following the rules for Publicly traded partnerships, earlier.          Box 3. Other Net Rental Income (Loss) The amount in box 3 is a passive activity amount for all partners. If the partnership had more than one rental activity, it will attach a statement identifying the income or loss from each activity. Report the income or loss as follows.    If box 3 is a loss, follow the Instructions for Form 8582 to figure how much of the loss can be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (g). However, if the box in item D is checked, report the loss following the rules for Publicly traded partnerships, earlier.   If income is reported in box 3, report the income on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (h). However, if the box in item D is checked, report the income following the rules for Publicly traded partnerships, earlier.          Box 4a. Guaranteed Payments for Services Guaranteed payments are payments made by a partnership to a partner that are determined without regard to the partnership's income. Generally, amounts on this line are not passive income, and you should report them on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (k) (for example, guaranteed payments for personal services).     Box 4b. Guaranteed Payments for Capital These are guaranteed payments other than for services, such as for the use of capital or attributable to section 736(a)(2) payments for unrealized receivables or goodwill. Amounts on this line should be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (k) (for example, guaranteed payments for capital).     Box 4c. Total Guaranteed Payments Amounts on this line include total guaranteed payments paid to you by the partnership.      Portfolio Income Portfolio income or loss (shown in boxes 5 through 9b and in box 11, code A) isn't subject to the passive activity limitations. Portfolio income includes income (not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business) from interest, ordinary dividends, annuities or royalties, and gain or loss on the sale of property that produces such income or is held for investment.    Box 5. Interest Income Report interest income on line 2b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If the amount of interest income included in box 5 includes interest from the credit for holders of clean renewable energy bonds, the partnership will attach a statement to Schedule K-1 showing your share of interest income from these credits. Because the basis of your interest in the partnership has been increased by your share of the interest income from these credits, you must reduce your basis by the same amount. See line 4 of the Worksheet for Adjusting the Basis of a Partner's Interest in the Partnership.     Box 6a. Ordinary Dividends Report ordinary dividends on line 3b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.     Box 6b.

See the instructions for line 4g of Form 4952, Investment Interest Expense Deduction, for important information on making this election.    If you have any foreign source qualified dividends, see the instructions for box 16, later. Attach a statement to the K-1 identifying the dividends included in box 6a or 6b that are:    Eligible for the deduction for dividends received under sections 243 (a), (b), or (c),   Eligible for the deduction for dividends received under section 245,   Eligible for the deduction for dividends received under section 245A, and   Hybrid dividends as defined in section 245A(e)(4).          Box 6c. Dividend Equivalents Dividend equivalents are not reported on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. This information is provided for persons that are not U.S. persons, who generally are required to treat dividend equivalents as U.S. source dividends, and domestic partnerships with partners who may need this information. The ordinary dividends amount in line 6a does not include the amount of dividend equivalents.     Box 7. Royalties Report royalties on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 4.     Box 8.

Collectibles (28%) Gain (Loss) Report collectibles gain or loss on line 4 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet—Line 18 in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).    If you have any foreign source collectibles (28%) gain (loss), see the instructions for box 16, later.     Box 9c. Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain There are three types of unrecaptured section 1250 gain. Report your share of this unrecaptured gain on the Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet—Line 19 in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) as follows.

If it reports the other two types of unrecaptured gain, it will provide an attached statement that shows the amount for each type of unrecaptured section 1250 gain.    If you have any foreign source unrecaptured section 1250 gain, see the instructions for box 16, later.     Box 10. Net Section 1231 Gain (Loss) The amount in box 10 is generally passive if it is from a:    Rental activity, or   Trade or business activity in which you didn't materially participate.      However, an amount from a rental real estate activity isn't from a passive activity if you were a real estate professional (defined earlier) and you materially participated in the activity. If the amount is either (a) a loss that isn't from a passive activity or (b) a gain, report it on line 2, column (g), of Form 4797, Sales of Business Property. Do not complete columns (b) through (f) on line 2 of Form 4797. Instead, enter ""From Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)"" across these columns. If the amount is a loss from a passive activity, see Passive Loss Limitations in the Instructions for Form 4797. Report the loss following the Instructions for Form 8582 to figure how much of the loss is allowed on Form 4797. However, if the box in item D is checked, report the loss following the rules for Publicly traded partnerships, earlier. If the partnership had net section 1231 gain (loss) from more than one activity, it will attach a statement that will identify the section 1231 gain (loss) from each activity.    If you have any foreign source net section 1231 gain (loss), see the instructions for box 16, later.     Box 11. Other Income (Loss)  Code A. Other portfolio income (loss). The partnership will report portfolio income other than interest, ordinary dividend, royalty, and capital gain (loss) income, and attach a statement to tell you what kind of portfolio income is reported.  If the partnership held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), it will report on the statement your share of REMIC taxable income (net loss) that you report on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 38, column (d). The statement will also report your share of any ""excess inclusion"" that you report on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 38, column (c), and your share of section 212 expenses that you report on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 38, column (e).

You must figure your gain or loss from the disposition by increasing your share of the adjusted basis by the intangible drilling costs, development costs, or mine exploration costs for the property that you capitalized (that is, costs that you didn't elect to deduct under section 59(e)). Report a loss in Part I of Form 4797. Report a gain in Part III of Form 4797 in accordance with the instructions for line 28. See Regulations section 1.1254-5 for details.

If the partnership has investment income or other investment expense, it will report your share of these items in box 20 using codes A and B. Include investment income and expenses from other sources to figure how much of your total investment interest is deductible. You will also need this information to figure your investment interest expense deduction. If the partnership paid or accrued interest on debts properly allocable to investment property, the amount of interest you are allowed to deduct may be limited. For more information on the special provisions that apply to investment interest expense, see Form 4952 and Pub. 550, Investment Income and Expenses.   Code I. Deductions—royalty income. Include deductions allocable to royalties on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 19. For this type of expense, enter ""From Schedule K-1 (Form 1065).""

On an attached statement, the partnership will show the type and the amount of qualified expenditures for which you may make a section 59(e) election. The statement will also identify the property for which the expenditures were paid or incurred. If there is more than one type of expenditure, the amount of each type will also be listed. If you deduct these expenditures in full in the current year, they are treated as adjustments or tax preference items for purposes of alternative minimum tax. However, you may elect to amortize these expenditures over the number of years in the applicable period rather than deducting the full amount in the current year. If you make this election, these items are not treated as adjustments or tax preference items. Under the election, you can deduct circulation expenditures ratably over a 3-year period. Research and experimental expenditures and mining exploration and development costs can be amortized over a 10-year period. Intangible drilling and development costs can be amortized over a 60-month period. The amortization period begins with the month in which such costs were paid or incurred. Make the election on Form 4562. If you make the election, report the current year amortization of section 59(e) expenditures from Part VI of Form 4562 on line 28 of Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). If you do not make the election, report the section 59(e)(2) expenditures on line 28 of Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) and figure the resulting adjustment or tax preference item (see Form 6251, Alternative Minimum Tax—Individuals). Whether you deduct the expenditures or elect to amortize them, report the amount on a separate line in column (i) of line 28 if you materially participated in the partnership activity. If you didn't materially participate, follow the Instructions for Form 8582 to figure how much of the deduction can be reported in column (g).   Code K. Excess business interest expense. If the partnership reports excess business interest expense to the partner, the partner is required to file Form 8990. See the Instructions for Form 8990 for additional information.  For tax years beginning after 2017, the partner’s basis in its partnership interest at the end of the tax year is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of excess business interest allocated to the partner for the tax year, even if the partner is not allowed a deduction for the allocated excess business interest in the year of the basis reduction. If the partner disposes of a partnership interest in which the basis has been reduced before all of the allocated excess business interest was used, the partner increases its basis immediately before the sale for the amount not yet deducted.    Code L. Deductions—portfolio (other). Generally, you should report these amounts on Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 16. See the instructions for Schedule A, line 16, for details.

If your benefits exceed $5,250, you may be able to use the excess amount on Form 8863 to figure the education credits.   Code O. Dependent care benefits. The partnership will report the dependent care benefits you received. You must use Form 2441, Part III, to figure the amount, if any, of the benefits you may exclude from your income.    Code P. Preproductive period expenses. You may be able to deduct these expenses currently or you may need to capitalize them under section 263A. See Pub. 225, Farmer's Tax Guide, and Regulations section 1.263A-4 for details.   Code Q. Commercial revitalization deduction from rental real estate activities.

If you didn't materially participate in the activity, use Form 8582 to figure the amount to report on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), line 28, column (g). If you materially participated in the reforestation activity, report the deduction on line 28, column (i), of Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).   Codes T through U. These codes are reserved for future use.   Code V. Section 743(b) negative adjustments. The partnership will use this code to report the income or gain resulting from your total net section 743(b) basis adjustments. If the amount reported is from multiple section 743(b) adjustments, the partnership will attach a schedule showing the assets to which the section 743(b) income or gain items relate and the computation of your net 743(b) basis adjustment in box 20.

Interest paid or accrued on debt properly allocable to your share of a working interest in any oil or gas property (if your liability isn't limited). If you didn't materially participate in the oil or gas activity, this interest is investment interest reportable as described earlier under Code H. Investment interest expense; otherwise, it is trade or business interest. If you didn't materially participate in the oil or gas activity, this interest is investment interest expense and should be reported on Form 4952. If you materially participated in the activity, report the interest on line 28 of Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). On a separate line, enter ""interest expense"" and the name of the partnership in column (a) and the amount in column (i).   Contributions to a capital construction fund (CCF). The deduction for a CCF investment isn't taken on Schedule E (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).

For details, see Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit, and its instructions; Form 1118, Foreign Tax Credit—Corporations, and its instructions; and Pub. 514, Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals.  Codes D and K. These codes are reserved for future use.   Codes S and T. Extraterritorial income exclusion.      Partnership did not claim the exclusion. If the partnership reports your share of foreign trading gross receipts (code S) and the extraterritorial income exclusion (code T), the partnership wasn't entitled to claim the exclusion because it didn't meet the foreign economic process requirements. You may still qualify for your share of this exclusion if the partnership's foreign trading gross receipts for the tax year were $5 million or less. To qualify for this exclusion, your foreign trading gross receipts from all sources for the tax year also must have been $5 million or less. If you qualify for the exclusion, report the exclusion amount in accordance with the instructions for Income (Loss), earlier, for box 1, 2, or 3, whichever applies. See Form 8873, Extraterritorial Income Exclusion, for details.   Partnership claimed the exclusion. If the partnership reports your share of foreign trading gross receipts but not the amount of the extraterritorial income exclusion, the partnership met the foreign economic process requirements and claimed the exclusion when figuring your share of partnership income. You also may need to know the amount of your share of foreign trading gross receipts from this partnership to determine if you met the $5 million or less exception discussed above for purposes of qualifying for an extraterritorial income exclusion from other sources.          Upon request, the partnership should furnish you a copy of the partnership's Form 8873 if there is a reduction for international boycott operations, illegal bribes, kickbacks, and other payments.  Codes U and V. These codes are reserved for future use.    Code W. Section 965 information. The partnership will report foreign income tax information for the calculation of creditable foreign income taxes related to the section 965(a) inclusions. The partnership will attach Form 965, including its Schedules F and H, to the Schedule K-1.    Code X. Other foreign transactions. On a statement attached to Schedule K-1, the partnership will report any other information on foreign transactions that you may need using code X. The partnership will attach a statement that separately identifies any arrangement, along with the taxes paid or accrued in connection with the arrangement, in which the partnership participates that would qualify as a splitter arrangement under section 909 if one or more partners are covered persons regarding an entity that took into account related income from the arrangement. The statement will also indicate whether the partnership has taken into account any related income from any such splitter arrangement. See section 909 and the related regulations for rules regarding splitter arrangements. When the gain deferral method, as described in Temporary Regulations section 1.721(c)-3T is being applied, a partnership that is a section 721(c) partnership will attach to the Schedule K-1 provided to a U.S. transferor the information required under Temporary Regulations section 1.721(c)-6T(b)(2) and (3). A partnership that is a section 721(c) partnership will also attach to its Form 1065 a Schedule K-1 for each partner that is a related foreign person with respect to the U.S. transferor. For an indirect partner that is a related foreign person with respect to the U.S. transferor, the Schedule K-1 will only include relevant information with respect to section 721(c) property. See Temporary Regulations section 1.721(c)-1T for definitions.      Box 17. Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Items Use the information reported in box 17 (as well as your adjustments and tax preference items from other sources) to prepare your Form 6251, Alternative Minimum Tax—Individuals; Form 4626, Alternative Minimum Tax—Corporations; or Schedule I (Form 1041), Alternative Minimum Tax—Estates and Trusts.    A partner that is a corporation subject to AMT must notify the partnership of its status.  Code A. Post-1986 depreciation adjustment. This amount is your share of the partnership's post-1986 depreciation adjustment. If you are an individual partner, report this amount on line 2l of Form 6251.   Code B. Adjusted gain or loss. This amount is your share of the partnership's adjusted gain or loss. If you are an individual partner, report this amount on line 2k of Form 6251.   Code C. Depletion (other than oil & gas). This amount is your share of the partnership's depletion adjustment. If you are an individual partner, report this amount on line 2d of Form 6251.   Codes D and E. Oil, gas, & geothermal properties—gross income and deductions. The amounts reported on these lines include only the gross income (code D) from, and deductions (code E) allocable to, oil, gas, and geothermal properties included in box 1 of Schedule K-1. The partnership should have attached a statement that shows any income from or deductions allocable to such properties that are included in boxes 2 through 13, 18, and 20 of Schedule K-1. Use the amounts reported and the amounts on the attached statement to help you figure the net amount to enter on Form 6251, line 2t.   Code F. Other AMT items. Enter the information on the statement attached by the partnership on the applicable lines of Form 6251, Form 4626, or Schedule I (Form 1041).      Box 18. Tax-Exempt Income and Nondeductible Expenses  Code A. Tax-exempt interest income. Report on your return, as an item of information, your share of the tax-exempt interest received or accrued by the partnership during the year. Individual partners include this amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 2a. Increase the adjusted basis of your interest in the partnership by this amount.   Code B. Other tax-exempt income. Increase the adjusted basis of your interest in the partnership by the amount shown, but do not include it in income on your tax return.     The partnership will attach a statement for the amount included under code B that is exempt by reason of section 892 and describe the nature of the income.  Code C. Nondeductible expenses. The nondeductible expenses paid or incurred by the partnership are not deductible on your tax return. Decrease the adjusted basis of your interest in the partnership by this amount.      Box 19. Distributions  Code A. Cash and marketable securities. Code A shows the distributions the partnership made to you of cash and certain marketable securities. The marketable securities are included at their fair market value (FMV) on the date of distribution (minus your share of the partnership's gain on the securities distributed to you). If the amount shown as code A exceeds the adjusted basis of your partnership interest immediately before the distribution, the excess is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of your partnership interest. Generally, this gain is treated as gain from the sale of a capital asset and should be reported on Form 8949 and the Schedule D for your return. However, if you receive cash or property in exchange for any part of a partnership interest, the amount of the distribution attributable to your share of the partnership's unrealized receivable or inventory items results in ordinary income (see Regulations section 1.751-1(a) and Sale or Exchange of Partnership Interest, earlier). For details, see Pub. 541. The partnership will separately identify both of the following.     The FMV of the marketable securities when distributed (minus your share of the gain on the securities distributed to you).   The partnership's adjusted basis of those securities immediately before the distribution.      Decrease the adjusted basis of your interest in the partnership (but not below zero) by the amount of cash distributed to you and the partnership's adjusted basis of the distributed securities. Advances or drawings of money or property against your share are treated as current distributions made on the last day of the partnership's tax year. Your basis in the distributed marketable securities (other than in liquidation of your interest) is the smaller of:     The partnership's adjusted basis in the securities immediately before the distribution increased by any gain recognized on the distribution of the securities, or   The adjusted basis of your partnership interest reduced by any cash distributed in the same transaction and increased by any gain recognized on the distribution of the securities.      If you received the securities in liquidation of your partnership interest, your basis in the marketable securities is equal to the adjusted basis of your partnership interest reduced by any cash distributed in the same transaction and increased by any gain recognized on the distribution of the securities.   Code B. Distribution subject to section 737. If a partner contributed section 704(c) built-in gain property within the last 7 years and the partnership made a distribution of property to that partner other than the previously contributed built-in gain property, the partner may be required to recognize gain under section 737. This gain is in addition to any gain recognized under section 731 on the distribution. When this occurs, the partnership will enter code B in box 19 of the contributing partner's Schedule K-1 and attach a statement that provides the information the partner needs to figure the recognized gain under section 737. The partnership is required to provide the following information.    The FMV of the distributed property (other than money).   The amount of money received in the distribution.   The net precontribution gain of the partner.      Using the information from the attached statement, complete the worksheet below to figure your recognized gain under section 737.              Computation of Section 737 Gain    1.  Enter the FMV of the distributed property (other than money)    $     2.  Enter your adjusted basis in the partnership immediately before the distribution. See Basis Limitations, earlier          3.  Enter the amount of money received in the distribution          4.  Subtract line 3 from line 2. If zero or less, enter -0-          5.  Subtract line 4 from line 1          6. Enter your net precontribution gain          7. Section 737 gain. Enter the lesser of the amount on line 5 or line 6              The type of gain (section 1231 gain, capital gain) generated is determined by the type of gain you would have recognized if you sold the property rather than contributing it to the partnership. Accordingly, report the amount from line 7, above, on Form 4797 or Form 8949 and the Schedule D of your tax return.    Code C. Other property. Code C shows the partnership's adjusted basis of property other than money immediately before the property was distributed to you. In addition, the partnership should report the adjusted basis and FMV of each property distributed. Decrease the adjusted basis of your interest in the partnership by the amount of your basis in the distributed property. Your basis in the distributed property (other than in liquidation of your interest) is the smaller of:     The partnership's adjusted basis immediately before the distribution, or   The adjusted basis of your partnership interest reduced by any cash distributed in the same transaction.      If you received the property in liquidation of your interest, your basis in the distributed property is equal to the adjusted basis of your partnership interest reduced by any cash distributed in the same transaction. If you receive cash or property in exchange for any part of a partnership interest, the amount of the distribution attributable to your share of the partnership's unrealized receivable or inventory items results in ordinary income (see Regulations section 1.751-1(a) and Sale or Exchange of Partnership Interest, earlier).      Box 20. Other Information  Code A. Investment income. Report this amount on line 4a of Form 4952.   Code B. Investment expenses. Report this amount on line 5 of Form 4952.   Code C.

The partnership will report your share of qualified rehabilitation expenditures and other information you need to complete Form 3468 for property not related to rental real estate activities in box 20 using code D. Your share of qualified rehabilitation expenditures related to rental real estate activities is reported in box 15 using code E. See the Instructions for Form 3468 for details. If the partnership is reporting expenditures from more than one activity, the attached statement will separately identify the expenditures from each activity. Combine the expenditures (for Form 3468 reporting) from box 15, code E, and box 20, code D. The expenditures related to rental real estate activities (box 15, code E) are reported on Schedule K-1 separately from other qualified rehabilitation expenditures (box 20, code D) because they are subject to different passive activity limitation rules. See the Instructions for Form 8582-CR for details.   Code E. Basis of energy property. If the partnership provides an attached statement for code E, use the information on the statement to complete the applicable energy credit on line 12 of Form 3468. See Energy Credit in the Instructions for Form 3468.   Codes F and G. Recapture of low-income housing credit. A section 42(j)(5) partnership will report recapture of a low-income housing credit with code F. All other partnerships will report recapture of a low-income housing credit with code G. Keep a separate record of recapture from each of these sources so that you will be able to correctly figure any recapture of low-income housing credit that may result from the disposition of all or part of your partnership interest. For details, see Form 8611.   Code H. Recapture of investment credit. The partnership will provide any information you need to figure your recapture tax on Form 4255, Recapture of Investment Credit.

Code J. Look-back interest—completed long-term contracts. The partnership will report any information you need to figure the interest due or to be refunded under the look-back method of section 460(b)(2) on certain long-term contracts. Use Form 8697, Interest Computation Under the Look-Back Method for Completed Long-Term Contracts, to report any such interest.   Code K. Look-back interest—income forecast method. The partnership will report any information you need to figure the interest due or to be refunded under the look-back method of section 167(g)(2) for certain property placed in service after September 13, 1995, and depreciated under the income forecast method. Use Form 8866, Interest Computation Under the Look-Back Method for Property Depreciated Under the Income Forecast Method, to report any such interest.   Code L. Dispositions of property with section 179 deductions. The partnership will report your share of gain or loss on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property for which a section 179 expense deduction was passed through to partners with code L. If the partnership passed through a section 179 expense deduction for the property, you must report the gain or loss and any recapture of the section 179 expense deduction for the property on your income tax return (see the Instructions for Form 4797 for details).

To figure the amount of depreciation allowed or allowable for Form 4797, line 22, add to the amount from item 6, above, the amount of your share of the section 179 expense deduction, reduced by any unused carryover of the deduction for this property. This amount may be different from the amount of section 179 expense you deducted for the property if your interest in the partnership has changed.   If the disposition is due to a casualty or theft, a statement providing the information you need to complete Form 4684.   If the sale was an installment sale, any information you need to complete Form 6252, Installment Sale Income.

Any information you need to complete a disclosure statement for reportable transactions in which the partnership participates. If the partnership participates in a transaction that must be disclosed on Form 8886, Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement, both you and the partnership may be required to file Form 8886 for the transaction. The determination of whether you are required to disclose a transaction of the partnership is based on the category(s) under which the transaction qualifies for disclosure and is determined by you and the partnership. You may have to pay a penalty if you are required to file Form 8886 and do not do so. See the Instructions for Form 8886 for details.   Noncash charitable contributions.

Instructions for Form 1099-LS - Main Contents       General Instructions  This form is used by the acquirer of any interest in a life insurance contract (also known as a life insurance policy) in a reportable policy sale to report the acquisition. In general, a reportable policy sale is any direct or indirect acquisition of any interest in a life insurance contract if the acquirer, at the time of the acquisition, has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the person insured under that contract, apart from the acquirer’s interest in such life insurance contract. See section 101(a)(3). Certain exceptions may apply. See Regulations section 1.101-1(c)(2). The acquisition of an interest in a partnership, trust, or other entity that holds an interest in a life insurance contract may be an indirect acquisition of that interest in a life insurance contract and may be a reportable policy sale. See Regulations section 1.101-1(e)(3)(ii).    Who Must File Generally, file Form 1099-LS if you are the acquirer of any interest in a life insurance contract in a reportable policy sale. An acquirer is any person that acquires an interest in a life insurance contract (through a direct acquisition or indirect acquisition of the interest) in a reportable policy sale. You may not have to file Form 1099-LS if the interest in a life insurance contract was transferred to you gratuitously, if you qualify for an exception in Regulations section 1.6050Y-2(f), or if another acquirer or third party information reporting contractor reports on your behalf under the unified reporting provisions of Regulations section 1.6050Y-2(b). You may qualify for an exception in Regulations section 1.6050Y-2(f) if you are a foreign person, if you report reportable policy sale payments made to a person other than the seller under section 6041 or 6041A, or if you acquire a life insurance contract in a section 1035 exchange. If you are the acquirer, enter your name, address, telephone number, and taxpayer identification number (TIN). Additionally, enter the name, address, and telephone number of your information contact, if different from your own. This contact information must provide direct access to a person who can answer questions about this information return.     Reporting If you are the acquirer, you must file a separate Form 1099-LS for each payment recipient with respect to each interest in a life insurance contract you acquired in a reportable policy sale. Enter the name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the payment recipient, the name of the issuer of the life insurance contract, the policy number of the life insurance contract, the amount paid to the payment recipient, and the date of the sale. See Regulations section 1.6050Y-2.     Payment Recipient In general, a reportable policy sale payment recipient (payment recipient) is any person that receives a reportable policy sale payment in a reportable policy sale. A payment recipient may include any seller in the reportable policy sale (any person that holds an interest in a life insurance contract and transfers that interest, or any part of that interest, to an acquirer in a reportable policy sale), as well as any broker or other intermediary that retains a portion of the cash or other consideration transferred in the reportable policy sale. See Regulations section 1.6050Y-1(a)(16)(i) for the definition of a reportable policy sale payment recipient and section 1.6050Y-1(a)(18)(i) for the definition of seller. However, a person other than a seller is not a payment recipient if that person received aggregate payments of less than $600 with respect to a reportable policy sale. See Regulations section 1.6050Y-1(a)(16)(ii).     Issuer The issuer is the person responsible for administering the life insurance contract, including collecting premiums and paying death benefits under the contract, on the date a Form 1099-LS is required to be furnished under section 6050Y(a), or their designee. See Regulations section 1.6050Y-1(a)(8)(i), (ii), and (iv).     Policy Number The policy number is the unique identifying number assigned to the life insurance contract by the issuer named on the Form 1099-LS.     Statements to Payment Recipient and Issuer If you are required to file Form 1099-LS, you must generally furnish a statement or acceptable substitute to each payment recipient and to the issuer, as shown in the table below. The requirement to furnish a statement to the issuer applies only with respect to a Form 1099-LS filed with respect to the seller and only if your acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract in a reportable policy sale is a direct acquisition. See Regulations section 1.6050Y-2(d)(2)(i). Statements furnished to the issuer should be directed to the administrative office that, pursuant to the life insurance contract, processes transfers of ownership. You may not have to furnish statements to the payment recipient and issuer if another acquirer or third party information reporting contractor reports on your behalf under the unified reporting provisions of Regulations section 1.6050Y-2(b).         IF the statement is for the... THEN use...   Payment recipient Copy B   Issuer Copy C     For more information about the requirement to furnish a statement to the payment recipient and the issuer, see part M in the current General Instructions for Certain Information Returns.   Truncating recipient’s TIN on payment recipient statements. Pursuant to Regulations section 301.6109-4, all filers of this form may truncate the payment recipient’s TIN (social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN)) on statements furnished to a payment recipient (Copy B). Truncation is not allowed on any documents the filer files with the IRS. An acquirer’s TIN may not be truncated on any form. See part J in the current General Instructions for Certain Information Returns.      Rescission of Reportable Policy Sale If a reportable policy sale is rescinded and you have filed a Form 1099-LS with respect to the reportable policy sale, you must file a corrected Form 1099-LS within 15 calendar days of the receipt of notice of the rescission. If a reportable policy sale is rescinded and you have furnished a statement with respect to the reportable policy sale to a payment recipient or issuer, you must furnish the recipient of that statement with a corrected statement within 15 calendar days of the receipt of notice of the rescission. See Regulations section 1.6050Y-2(e).      Specific Instructions    Box 1. Amount Paid to Payment Recipient Enter the total amount paid to the payment recipient in the reportable policy sale. The acquirer is not required to report this information to the issuer of the life insurance contract. Reporting the amount paid to the payment recipient is therefore optional on Copy C.     Box 2.

140,Instructions for Schedule P (Form 1120-F) (2019),"   Instructions for Schedule P (Form 1120-F) (2019)  List of Foreign Partner Interests in Partnerships    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    2019        Instructions for Schedule P (Form 1120-F) - Introductory Material       Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Schedule P (Form 1120-F) and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form1120F.      General Instructions      Purpose of Schedule Schedule P (Form 1120-F) is used to identify and reconcile the foreign corporation's directly held partnership interests with the distributive shares of partnership effectively connected income (ECI), or expenses allocable to ECI, and the foreign corporation's effectively connected outside tax basis in each interest. Part I is used to identify all partnership interests the foreign corporation directly owns that give rise to a distributive share of income or loss that is effectively connected with a trade or business within the United States of the foreign corporation. Part II is used to reconcile the foreign corporation's distributive share of ECI and allocable expenses with the total income and expenses reported to it on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), Partner's Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc. Part III is used as follows. The corporation's outside basis in its directly held partnership interests that include ECI in the corporation's distributive share is apportioned between ECI and non-ECI under Regulations section 1.884-1(d)(3) to determine the average value treated as a U.S. asset for interest expense allocation purposes under Regulations section 1.882-5. The apportionment of the outside basis to ECI as of the current and prior tax year end is also taken into account in determining the average apportioned value included in the corporation's U.S. assets for purposes of computing the branch profits tax. The U.S. assets and partner share of booked liabilities and interest expense of the partnership are also coordinated with the interest expense allocation computations reported on Schedule I (Form 1120-F).    If you disposed of all or a portion of any partnership interest listed on Schedule P during your taxable year, then you may have to report any gain or loss from that disposition on Form 1120-F. See section 864(c)(8) and item HH on page 3 of Form 1120-F.     Who Must Complete Schedule P A foreign corporation that is directly or indirectly engaged in trade or business within the United States is required to file Schedule P (Form 1120-F) for all directly owned partnership interests that have ECI, or expenses allocable to ECI, included in its distributive share of income reported to the corporation on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). If the foreign corporation treats any of its distributive share of partnership net income or loss from a partnership that is not engaged in trade or business within the United States as ECI with another trade or business of the corporation, the corporation's entire distributive share of items of income and expense from any such partnership must also be reconciled between ECI and non-ECI and reported on Schedule P. A foreign corporation may be engaged in a trade or business within the United States either directly through its own non-partnership related activities or indirectly, including through the activities of one or more partnerships in which the corporation owns a partnership interest. In addition, if a corporation owns an interest in a partnership that is itself deemed engaged in trade or business within the United States as a result of the partnership's own directly or indirectly owned interest in another partnership (""lower-tier partnership""), the corporation is also treated as engaged in trade or business as a result of its direct and indirect ownership of such interests. See section 875(1). The foreign corporation's distributive share of income from a domestic partnership and certain foreign partnership interests is reported to the partner on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), together with the corporation's allocable share of partnership liabilities. If the partnership is engaged in a trade or business directly or indirectly through a lower-tier partnership and has ECI to report in the distributive share of a foreign partner, it is responsible for making quarterly installment payments of withholding tax under section 1446 on the foreign partner's allocable share of estimated effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) and reporting to the foreign partner, on Form 8805, Foreign Partner’s Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax, the amounts of ECTI and section 1446 tax withheld for the tax year. A foreign corporation that receives from a partnership Form 8805, reporting ECTI, must reconcile and report its entire distributive share of income and expenses the partnership reported on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) on Schedule P (Form 1120-F). The corporation should not reconcile and report its distributive share of partnership income and expenses based on its allocable share of partnership ECTI reported on line 9 of Form 8805.     Exceptions From Filing Schedule P Do not file Schedule P if none of the distributive shares from any of the corporation's partnership interests include ECI, or expenses allocable to ECI. A foreign corporation that has ECI reported to it from a partnership is not required to file Schedule P (Form 1120-F) if none of the corporation's business profits including its ECI from the partnership are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty and the corporation files a protective tax return under Regulations section 1.882-4(a)(3)(vi).    Protective election on Schedule P. See Protective election, later, for instructions for making a protective partnership outside basis apportionment election with a protective return filing of Form 1120-F.      When and Where To File Attach Schedule P (Form 1120-F) to the foreign corporation's Form 1120-F income tax return. See the Instructions for Form 1120-F for the time, place, and manner for filing the foreign corporation's income tax return.     Other Forms and Schedules Related to Schedule P  Form 1120-F, Section II. Gross ECI includible in the corporation's distributive share is reportable on Form 1120-F, Section II, lines 3 through 10, in the applicable category of income. Expenses (other than interest expense) that are deductions allocated and apportioned on Schedule P (Form 1120-F) to the partner's ECI are also reported on Form 1120-F, Section II.   Schedule I (Form 1120-F). A portion of the interest expense reportable on Schedule P is includible in the corporation's interest expense allocation computation under Regulations section 1.882-5. The corporation's distributive share of interest expense that is directly allocable to ECI under Regulations section 1.882-5(a)(1)(ii)(B) is reported on Schedule P, line 15b, and on Schedule I (Form 1120-F), line 22. A portion of the corporation's distributive share of interest expense that is reported on Schedule P, line 15c, is reported on Schedule I (Form 1120-F), line 9, column (b). The average value of partnership liabilities the corporation includes in the determination of its outside basis for purposes of determining the proportion of the partnership interest treated as a U.S. asset is reported on Schedule P (Form 1120-F), line 18 (Total column). The average value of the partner's outside basis used to determine the proportion of the partnership interest treated as a U.S. asset is reported on Schedule P (Form 1120-F), line 20, and as a U.S. asset on Schedule I (Form 1120-F), line 5, column (b).   Schedule H (Form 1120-F), Part I, Part II, and Part IV. The corporation's distributive share of non-interest expenses included on Schedule P, lines 4 and 5, is also included in the corporation's overall allocation and apportionment of expenses on Schedule H (Form 1120-F), Part IV, lines 38a through 41, if the partnership books constitute set(s) of books that are also reportable on Form 1120-F, Schedule L or the partnership interest is recorded on Schedule L books of the corporation's own separate trade or business within the United States. If the partnership interest is not reported on Schedule L, the distributive share of partnership expenses allocable to the corporation's distributive share of ECI is included on Schedule H (Form 1120-F) in Parts I and II. See the Instructions for Schedule H (Form 1120-F).   Schedule M-3 (Form 1120-F), Part II. The corporation's distributive share of partnership income or loss may be reported on Schedule M-3 (Form 1120-F), Part II, line 9 (domestic partnerships) and line 10 (certain foreign partnerships), in accordance with the corporation's reporting on its applicable financial statements for Schedule M-3 (Form 1120-F) purposes. See the instructions for Schedule M-3 (Form 1120-F), Part II, lines 9 and 10, for the specific reporting requirements.   Form 8990, Limitation on Business Interest Expense Under Section 163(j). Business interest expense includes any interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to a trade or business. Business interest expense is generally limited to the sum of business interest income, 30% of the adjusted taxable income, and floor plan financing interest. Form 8990 is required, unless an exception for filing is met. For more information, see section 163(j), Form 8990, and the Instructions for Form 8990.      Part I—List of Foreign Partner Interests in Partnerships In Part I, list the name, address, and employer identification number (EIN) of each directly owned partnership interest that has ECI included in the partner's distributive share on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). Also include in the list of partnership interests any interest in a partnership that is not engaged in trade or business within the United States if the corporation treats some or all of its distributive share as ECI with a separate trade or business of its own within the United States. Do not report on Schedule P any indirectly owned partnership interests (lower-tier partnership interests) that have income effectively connected with the lower-tier partnership's own trade or business within the United States unless the corporation also owns a direct interest in the lower-tier partnership. The corporation's distributive share of ECI earned through lower-tier partnership interests is includible on the Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) reportable to the corporation by the partnership in which the corporation owns a direct interest, whether or not the directly owned partnership is itself directly engaged in trade or business within the United States. Schedule P (Form 1120-F) accommodates reporting for four directly owned partnership interests. Complete a separate line in Part I, and the corresponding columns in Parts II and III, for each directly owned partnership interest. If the corporation directly owns more than four partnership interests which are required to be reported on Schedule P (Form 1120-F), report the required information for those additional partnership interests on attached separate sheets using the same size and format as shown on the schedule. Also, in the ""Totals"" column of Parts II and III, for each line item, enter the sum for all directly owned partnership interests, including those interests reported on attached sheets. Entities treated as partnerships for tax purposes include limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and limited liability companies (LLCs) that are not classified as corporations for federal income tax purposes and may be domestic or foreign. Do not include any interest in any entity treated as a disregarded entity as described under Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2).  Column (d). With respect to each partnership interest, check the ""Yes"" box if the foreign corporation's distributive share is ECI, or treated as ECI, in whole or in part, with a U.S. trade or business determined under section 875. Accordingly, with respect to each partnership interest, check the ""Yes"" box if the foreign corporation is engaged in a U.S. trade or business indirectly through the activities of the partnership. Check the ""No"" box if the foreign corporation has applied ECI principles solely at the partner level and not as a result of the partnership's activities.      Part II—Foreign Partner Income and Expenses: Reconciliation to Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) Part II reconciles the partner's ECI and non-ECI to its Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) distributive share from each partnership listed in Part I. The Schedule K-1 lines are grouped for reconciliation of their income and expense in the following manner.    Schedule P, lines 1 through 5: ECI and non-ECI reconciliation of income and non-interest expenses from Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), lines 1 through 3.   Schedule P, lines 6 through 10: Reconciliation of other income and other non-interest expenses from Schedule K-1 (Form 1065).

The amount entered on line 1 is grouped into its gross income and gross expense components for allocation and apportionment to ECI and non-ECI under sections 864(c) and 882(c). The gross income apportionments are shown on line 3, and the allocation and apportionments of non-interest expenses shown on line 5 are determined under Regulations sections 1.861-8 and 1.861-17 and Temporary Regulations section 1.861-8T(c). See Regulations section 1.861-17 for the allocation and ECI apportionment treatment of research and experimentation expenditures that are included in trade or business income on line 1 or 3, Schedule K-1, and which are also reportable on Schedule P (Form 1120-F), lines 4 and 5.

If interest expense is included on any line of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) other than line 1, 2, 3, 13, or 18, attach a statement indicating the line the interest is included on and reclassify the interest expense reported on such other line to Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), line 13 or line 18, as appropriate, for purposes of reporting the reclassified amount on line 14 of Schedule P. The reclassification will require an adjustment to such other line to prevent double counting of total expenses.     Line 15a. Total interest expense. Add lines 13 and 14 and enter the result on line 15a. This amount is the corporation's total distributive share of interest expense from Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) that is subject to allocation under Regulations section 1.882-5.   Line 15b.

Subtract line 15b from line 15a and enter the amount on line 15c. The portion of this expense amount that arises from U.S.- booked liabilities is required to be reported on Schedule I (Form 1120-F), line 9, column (b). See Regulations section 1.882-5(d)(4). A portion of the line 15c amount is also taken into account on Form 1120-F, Section III, Part II, line 8, in determining the corporation's branch interest under Regulations section 1.884-4(b).       Part III—Foreign Partner's Average Outside Basis Under Regulations Sections 1.882-5(b) and 1.884-1(d)(3) Report in Part III the corporation's outside basis for each partnership interest identified in Part I of this Schedule P (Form 1120-F) for purposes of determining the amount the corporation includes as a U.S. asset in Step 1 of the interest expense allocation under Regulations section 1.882-5. The corporation's outside basis in its partnership interests reported on Schedule P is determined and adjusted under the rules applicable to the determination of the corporation's outside basis in the partnership for branch profits tax purposes under Regulations section 1.884-1(d)(3), except that the amounts entered on lines 16 through 20 are the average values rather than the determination dates used under the section 884 regulations for branch profits tax purposes. If the corporation is not exempt from the branch profits tax under an applicable income tax treaty, attach a statement showing the determination of the corporation's outside basis in accordance with the requirements of lines 16 through 20 for an averaging period that shows the apportioned outside basis for the beginning and ending determination dates of the corporation's tax year. See also section 163(j) for rules on how the trade or business interest limitation may affect outside basis.  Line 16. Section 705 outside basis. Enter on line 16 the corporation's average value of the outside basis (otherwise determined under section 705) of the partnership in the column which corresponds to the line in Part I on which the partnership interest is listed. The average value is determined using the most frequent averaging period for which data is reasonably available. See Regulations sections 1.882-5(b)(3) and 1.882-5(c)(2)(iv).    Line 17. Partner liabilities included in the corporation's outside basis. The corporation's outside basis reported on line 16 is adjusted on line 17 to conform the amount of liabilities the corporation includes in the determination of its outside basis to the proportionate amount of the corporation's distributive share of interest expense with respect to the partnership's liabilities. This adjustment is made only for purposes of determining the corporation's outside basis included in the interest expense allocation and branch profits tax computations. The adjustment is not made for other federal income tax purposes such as for determining the corporation's gain or loss from disposition of the partnership interest.    Line 17a. Adjustment for directly allocable interest. The outside basis is reduced by the average amount of liabilities that give rise to directly allocable interest expense in accordance with Regulations section 1.882-5(a)(1)(ii)(B). Enter the portion of the partnership liability that is subject to the direct interest expense allocation rules under Temporary Regulations section 1.861-10T(b) or (c) and is subject to exclusion from the determination of the corporation's average U.S. asset values under Regulations section 1.882-5. See Temporary Regulations section 1.861-10T(d).     Line 17b. Enter the average amount of the corporation's share of all other partnership liabilities it otherwise takes into account under section 752 in determining its outside basis in its partnership interest.    Line 18. Enter the corporation's average partnership liabilities, or portion thereof, for the year for which the corporation receives a distributive share of interest expense for the year. See Regulations section 1.884-1(d)(3)(vi). Also, enter this line 18 amount on Schedule I (Form 1120-F), line 8, column (b), to the extent applicable in determining the corporation's interest expense deduction under Regulations section 1.882-5.    Line 19. Partner's adjusted average outside basis in partnership. Add lines 17d and 18 and enter the amount on line 19. The amount reported on line 19 is the corporation's adjusted outside basis that is eligible for apportionment between ECI and non-ECI.    Line 20. Partner's outside basis allocable to ECI. Enter on line 20 the corporation's average outside basis reported on line 19 that is treated as a U.S. asset under Regulations sections 1.884-1(d)(3) and 1.882-5. Also enter this line 20 amount on Schedule I (Form 1120-F), line 5, column (b). See Regulations section 1.884-1(d)(3)(i) for the elective requirements for apportioning outside basis on the income or asset method. For purposes of determining the proportion of the partnership interest that is a U.S. asset, a foreign corporation may elect separately for each partnership interest to use either the asset method or the income method described in Regulations sections 1.884-1(d)(3)(ii) and (iii). See the instructions for line 21 below. If the corporation does not timely elect either method in the first year the corporation has a distributive share of ECI from the partnership, the Director of Field Operations may make the election on behalf of the corporation. See Regulations section 1.884-1(d)(3)(v).    Note. The required timely filed election under Regulations section 1.884-1(d)(3)(iv) for apportioning outside basis between ECI and non-ECI also applies to lower-tier partnership interests that are not required to be identified and reconciled to Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) on Schedule P (Form 1120-F).   Line 21. Outside basis election method. Enter ""income"" or ""asset"" on line 21 to indicate the elective outside basis apportionment method used to determine the amount of the corporation's outside basis in its partnership interests apportioned to ECI and reported on line 20. The allocation method is subject to a 5-year minimum period election that must be made in the first year the partner has a distributive share of ECI included in the income reported on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). The elective method chosen must be used for both branch profits tax and interest expense allocation purposes during the same 5-year minimum period. See Regulations section 1.884-1(d)(3)(iv).    Asset method. In general, a partner's interest in a partnership shall be treated as a U.S. asset in the same proportion that the sum of the partner's proportionate share of the adjusted bases of all partnership assets as of the determination date bears to the sum of the partner's proportionate share of the adjusted bases of all partnership assets as of the determination date. The proportion of U.S. assets to total assets of the partnership is determined as if the partnership were a foreign corporation engaged in trade or business within the United States. Generally, a partner's proportionate share of a partnership asset is the same as its proportionate share of all items of income, gain, loss, and deduction that may be generated by the asset. See Regulations section 1.884-1(d)(3)(ii)(B) for non-uniform treatment of certain partnership items.     Income method. Under the income method, a partner's interest in a partnership shall be treated as a U.S. asset in the same proportion that its distributive share of partnership ECI for the partnership's tax year that ends with or within the partner's tax year bears to its distributive share of all partnership income for that tax year.     Protective election. If the corporation files a protective tax return under Regulations section 1.882-4(a)(3)(vi), and the partnership is not engaged in trade or business within the United States or does not have business profits attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment, the corporation need not file Schedule P and report its distributive share of income and expenses with its Form 1120-F. However, if it is later determined that the corporation's distributive share of partnership income is ECI with respect to a trade or business of the corporation, the corporation will have failed to make a timely income method or asset method election with respect to such partnership for outside basis apportionment purposes if no other election disclosure is made. To preserve the right to allocate and apportion its outside basis under a chosen method, the corporation may make a protective election by completing Part I, and Part III, line 21, of Schedule P, and including it with the protective return filing of Form 1120-F. The protective election is effective only for the year in which the protective election is also the first year in which the corporation's distributive share is in fact ECI with a trade or business of the corporation within the United States. The corporation need not complete Part II, or Part III, lines 16 through 20, with the protective election.      "

The holding period for short-term capital gains and losses is generally 1 year or less. The holding period for long-term capital gains and losses is generally more than 1 year. However, an exception applies for certain sales of applicable partnership interests. See Transactions with respect to applicable partnership interests, later. For more information about holding periods, see the Instructions for Form 8949.     Items for Special Treatment  Note. For more information, see Pub. 544.   Transactions with respect to applicable partnership interests. The long-term holding period for gains and losses with respect to applicable partnership interests is more than 3 years. If the holding period is 3 years or less, gains and losses with respect to applicable partnership interests are treated as short-term. An applicable partnership interest is any interest in a partnership that, directly or indirectly, is transferred to (or is held by) the taxpayer in connection with the performance of substantial services by the taxpayer, or any other related person, in any applicable trade or business. See section 1061 and Pub. 541 for details. Figure gains and losses with respect to the applicable partnership interest on Form 8949 by applying the special holding period rules discussed above. See the Instructions for Form 8949.    Loss from a sale or exchange between the corporation and a related person. Except for distributions in complete liquidation of a corporation, no loss is allowed from the sale or exchange of property between the corporation and certain related persons. See section 267.   Loss from a wash sale. A wash sale occurs if the corporation acquires (by purchase or exchange), or has a contract or option to acquire, substantially identical stock or securities within 30 days before or after the date of the sale or exchange. The corporation can’t deduct a loss from a wash sale of stock or securities (including contracts or options to acquire or sell stock or securities) unless the corporation is a dealer in stock or securities and the loss was sustained in a transaction made in the ordinary course of the corporation's trade or business. For more information on wash sales, see section 1091 and Pub. 550. The wash sale rules don’t apply to a redemption of shares in a floating-NAV (net asset value) money market fund.  Report the transaction as the corporation otherwise would on Form 8949, Part I or II (depending on how long the corporation owned the stock or securities). Check the appropriate box. Enter ""W"" in column (f). Enter the nondeductible loss as a positive number in column (g). Complete all remaining columns. See the Instructions for Form 8949.   Gain on distributions of appreciated property. Generally, gain (but not loss) is recognized on a nonliquidating distribution of appreciated property to the extent that the property's fair market value (FMV) exceeds its adjusted basis. See section 311.   Gain or loss on distribution of property in complete liquidation. Generally, gain or loss is recognized on property distributed in a complete liquidation. Treat the property as if it had been sold at its FMV. See section 336.   Gain on certain short-term federal, state, and municipal obligations (other than tax-exempt obligations). If a short-term governmental obligation (other than a tax-exempt obligation) that is a capital asset is acquired at an acquisition discount, a portion of any gain realized is treated as ordinary income and any remaining balance is treated as a short-term capital gain. See section 1271.    Gain from installment sales. If the corporation sold property at a gain and it will receive a payment in a tax year after the year of sale, it generally must report the sale on the installment method unless it elects not to. However, the installment method may not be used to report sales of stock or securities traded on an established securities market.  Use Form 6252 to report the sale on the installment method. Also use Form 6252 to report any payment received during the tax year from a sale made in an earlier year that was reported on the installment method. Enter gain from the installment sales on Schedule D, line 4 or line 11, as applicable. See the Instructions for Form 6252. To elect out of the installment method, report the full amount of the gain on Form 8949 for the year of the sale on a return filed by the due date (including extensions). If the original return was filed on time without making the election, the corporation can make the election on an amended return filed no later than 6 months after the original due date of the return (excluding extensions). Enter ""Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2"" at the top of the amended return.   Gain or loss on an option to buy or sell property. See sections 1032 and 1234 for the rules that apply to a purchaser or grantor of an option or a securities futures contract (as defined in section 1234B). See Pub. 550 for details.   Gain or loss from a short sale of property. Report the gain or loss on Form 8949 to the extent that the property used to close the short sale is considered a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. Report any short sale in the year the sale closes.   If a short sale closed in 2019 but the corporation didn’t get a 2019 Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) for it because the corporation entered into it before 2011, report it on Form 8949 in Part I with box C checked or Part II with box F checked (whichever applies). In column (a), enter (for example) ""100 sh. XYZ Co.–2010 short sale closed."" Fill in the other columns according to their instructions. Report the short sale the same way if the corporation received a 2019 Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) that doesn't show the proceeds (sales price).  Loss from securities that are capital assets that become worthless during the year. Except for securities held by a bank, treat the loss as a capital loss as of the last day of the tax year. See section 582 for the rules on the treatment of securities held by a bank.   Nonrecognition of gain on sale of stock to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) or an eligible cooperative. See section 1042 and Temporary Regulations section 1.1042-1T for rules under which the corporation can elect not to recognize gain from the sale of certain stock to an ESOP or an eligible cooperative.   Bonds and other debt instruments. See Pub. 550.   Gain on disposition of market discount bonds. In general, a capital gain upon the disposition of a market discount bond is treated as interest income to the extent of accrued market discount as of the date of disposition. See sections 1276 through 1278 and Pub. 550 for more information on market discount. See the Instructions for Form 8949 for detailed information about how to report the disposition of a market discount bond.    Contingent payment debt instruments. Any gain recognized on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to the noncontingent bond method is generally treated as interest income rather than as capital gain. In certain situations, all or a portion of a loss recognized on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to the noncontingent bond method may be treated as an ordinary loss rather than as a capital loss. See Regulations section 1.1275-4(b) and Pub. 1212 for more information on contingent payment debt instruments subject to the noncontingent bond method. See the Instructions for Form 8949 for detailed information about how to report the disposition of a contingent payment debt instrument.    Nonbusiness bad debts. A nonbusiness bad debt must be treated as a short-term capital loss and can be deducted only in the year the debt becomes totally worthless. See Nonbusiness Bad Debts in Pub. 550 for details.   Real estate subdivided for sale. Certain lots or parcels that are part of a tract of real estate subdivided for sale may be treated as capital assets. See section 1237.   Sale of a partnership interest. A sale or other disposition of an interest in a partnership owning unrealized receivables or inventory items may result in ordinary gain or loss. See Pub. 541, Partnerships.   Special rules for traders in securities. Traders in securities are engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for their own account. To be engaged in a business as a trader in securities, the corporation:     Must seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities and not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation;   Must be involved in a trading activity that is substantial; and   Must carry on the activity with continuity and regularity.      The following facts and circumstances should be considered in determining if a corporation's activity is a business.     Typical holding periods for securities bought and sold.   The frequency and dollar amount of the corporation's trades during the year.   The extent to which the shareholders pursue the activity to produce income for a livelihood.   The amount of time devoted to the activity.      Like an investor, a trader generally must report each sale of securities (taking into account commissions and any other costs of acquiring or disposing of the securities) on Form 8949 unless one of the exceptions described under Exceptions to reporting each transaction on a separate row in the Instructions for Form 8949 applies. However, if a trader made the mark-to-market election (see the Instructions for Form 4797), each transaction is reported in Part II of Form 4797 instead of on Form 8949. The limitation on investment interest expense that applies to investors doesn't apply to interest paid or incurred in a trading business. A trader reports interest expense and other expenses (excluding commissions and other costs of acquiring and disposing of securities) from a trading business on page 1 of Form 1120-S. A trader also may hold securities for investment. The rules for investors generally will apply to those securities. If they apply, allocate interest and other expenses between the corporation's trading business and investment securities. Report investment interest expense on line 12b of Schedule K and in box 12 of Schedule K-1 using code H.   Gain from certain constructive ownership transactions. Gain in excess of the net underlying long-term gain the corporation would have recognized if it had held a financial asset directly during the term of a derivative contract must be treated as ordinary income. See section 1260.   Gain on the constructive sale of certain appreciated financial positions. Generally, the S corporation must recognize gain (but not loss) on the date it enters into a constructive sale of any appreciated position in stock, a partnership interest, or certain debt instruments as if the position were disposed of at FMV on that date. The S corporation is treated as making a constructive sale of an appreciated position when it (or a related person, in some cases) does one of the following.   Exception. Generally, constructive sale treatment doesn't apply if:    Enters into a short sale of the same or substantially identical property (that is, a “short sale against the box”).    Enters into an offsetting notional principal contract relating to the same or substantially identical property.    Enters into a futures or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially identical property.    Acquires the same or substantially identical property (if the appreciated position is a short sale, offsetting notional principal contract, or a futures or forward contract).   The S corporation closed the transaction before the end of the 30th day after the end of the tax year in which it was entered into,    The S corporation held the appreciated position to which the transaction relates throughout the 60-day period starting on the date the transaction was closed, and    At no time during that 60-day period was the S corporation's risk of loss reduced by holding certain other positions.       For details and other exceptions to these rules, see Pub. 550.   Rollover of gain from qualified small business (QSB) stock. If the corporation sold QSB stock (defined below) it held for more than 6 months, it can postpone gain if it purchased other QSB stock during the 60-day period that began on the date of the sale. The corporation must recognize gain to the extent the sale proceeds exceed the cost of the replacement stock. Reduce the basis of the replacement stock by any postponed gain. If the corporation chooses to postpone gain, report the entire gain realized on the sale on Form 8949, Part I or II (with the appropriate box checked). Enter ""R"" in column (f). Enter the amount of the postponed gain as a negative number (in parentheses) in column (g). Complete all remaining columns. See the Instructions for Form 8949.    The corporation also must separately state the amount of the gain rolled over on qualified stock under section 1045 on Form 1120-S, Schedule K, line 10. Each shareholder must determine if he or she qualifies for the rollover at the shareholder level. Also, the corporation must separately state on that line (and not on Form 8949) any gain that could qualify for the section 1045 rollover at the shareholder level instead of the corporate level (because a shareholder was entitled to purchase replacement stock). If the corporation had a gain on qualified stock that could qualify for the exclusion under section 1202, report that gain on Form 8949 (and on Form 1120-S, Schedule K, line 10). To be QSB stock, the stock must meet all of the following tests.    Note. A specialized small business investment company (SSBIC) is treated as having met test (2) above.    It must be stock in a C corporation.   It must have been originally issued after August 10, 1993.   As of the date the stock was issued, the corporation was a qualified small business. A qualified small business is a domestic C corporation with total gross assets of $50 million or less (a) at all times after August 9, 1993, and before the stock was issued, and (b) immediately after the stock was issued. Gross assets include those of any predecessor of the corporation. All corporations that are members of the same parent-subsidiary controlled group are treated as one corporation.   The corporation must have acquired the stock at its original issue (either directly or through an underwriter), either in exchange for money or other property or as pay for services (other than as an underwriter) to the corporation. In certain cases, the corporation may meet the test if it acquired the stock from another person who met this test (such as by gift or inheritance) or through a conversion or exchange of QSB stock held by the corporation.   During substantially all the time the corporation held the stock:    The issuer was a C corporation;   At least 80% of the value of the issuer's assets were used in the active conduct of one or more qualified businesses (defined below); and   The issuing corporation wasn't a foreign corporation, domestic international sales corporation (DISC), former DISC, corporation that has made (or that has a subsidiary that has made) a section 936 election, regulated investment company (RIC), real estate investment trust (REIT), real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), financial asset securitization investment trust (FASIT), or cooperative.         A qualified business is any business other than the following.     One involving services performed in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage services.

If the corporation chooses to report these transactions on lines 1a and 8a, don’t report them on Form 8949. Also, the corporation doesn’t need to attach a statement to explain the entries on lines 1a and 8a. Figure gain or loss on each line. Subtract the cost or other basis in column (e) from the proceeds (sales price) in column (d). Enter the gain or loss in column (h). Enter negative amounts in parentheses.  Example 1—basis reported to the IRS. The corporation received a Form 1099-B reporting the sale of stock held for 3 years, showing proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 is checked, meaning that basis was reported to the IRS. The corporation doesn't need to make any adjustments to the amounts reported on Form 1099-B or enter any codes. This was the corporation's only 2019 transaction. Instead of reporting this transaction on Form 8949, the corporation can enter $6,000 on Schedule D, line 8a, column (d), $2,000 in column (e), and $4,000 ($6,000 − $2,000) in column (h). If the corporation had a second transaction that was the same except that the proceeds were $5,000 and the basis was $3,000, combine the two transactions. Enter $11,000 ($6,000 + $5,000) on Schedule D, line 8a, column (d), $5,000 ($2,000 + $3,000) in column (e), and $6,000 ($11,000 − $5,000) in column (h).     Example 2—basis not reported to IRS. The corporation received a Form 1099-B showing proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 isn't checked, meaning that basis wasn't reported to the IRS. Don’t report this transaction on line 1a or line 8a. Instead, report the transaction on Form 8949. Complete all necessary pages of Form 8949 before completing line 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, or 10 of Schedule D.     Example 3—adjustment. The corporation received a Form 1099-B showing proceeds (in box 1d) of $6,000 and cost or other basis (in box 1e) of $2,000. Box 12 is checked, meaning that basis was reported to the IRS. However, the basis shown in box 1e is incorrect. Don’t report this transaction on line 1a or line 8a. Instead, report the transaction on Form 8949. See the instructions for Form 8949, columns (f), (g), and (h). Complete all necessary pages of Form 8949 before completing line 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, or 10 of Schedule D.        Lines 1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, and 10, Column (h)—Transactions Reported on Form 8949 Figure gain or loss on each line. First, subtract cost or other basis in column (e) from proceeds (sales price) in column (d). Then combine the results with any adjustments in column (g). Enter the results in column (h). Enter negative amounts in parentheses.  Example 1—gain. Column (d) is $6,000 and column (e) is $2,000. Enter $4,000 in column (h).     Example 2—loss. Column (d) is $6,000 and column (e) is $8,000. Enter ($2,000) in column (h).     Example 3—adjustment. Column (d) is $6,000, column (e) is $2,000, and column (g) is ($1,000). Enter $3,000 ($6,000 − $2,000 − $1,000) in column (h).        Line 13. Capital Gain Distributions Enter the total capital gain distributions paid to the corporation during the year.      Part III. Built-in Gains Tax Section 1374 provides for a tax on built-in gains. The built-in gains tax may apply to the following S corporations.    An S corporation that was a C corporation before it elected to be an S corporation.   An S corporation that acquired an asset with a basis determined (in whole or in part) by reference to its basis (or the basis of any other property) in the hands of a C corporation (a transferred-basis acquisition). See section 1374(d)(8).      An S corporation may owe the tax if it has net recognized built-in gain during the applicable recognition period. For computation details, see Regulations section 1.1374-1(a). The applicable recognition period is the 5-year period beginning:    For an asset held when the S corporation was a C corporation, on the first day of the first tax year for which the corporation is an S corporation; or   For a transferred-basis acquisition, on the date the asset was acquired by the S corporation.      A corporation described in both (1) and (2) above must figure the built-in gains tax separately for the group of assets it held at the time its S election became effective and for each group of transferred-basis acquisitions. For details, see Regulations section 1.1374-8. Certain transactions involving the disposal of timber, coal, or domestic iron ore under section 631 aren’t subject to the built-in gains tax. See Rev. Rul. 2001-50, which is on page 343 of Internal Revenue Bulletin 2001-43 at IRS.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb01-43.pdf.    Line 16 Generally, enter the amount that would be the taxable income of the corporation for the tax year if only recognized built-in gains (including any carryover of gain under section 1374(d)(2)(B)) and recognized built-in losses were taken into account. Generally, recognized built-in gain includes the following items.    Any gain recognized during the applicable recognition period on the sale, distribution, or other disposition of any asset, except to the extent the corporation establishes that:    The asset wasn't held by the corporation as of the beginning of the applicable recognition period, or   The gain exceeds the excess of the FMV of the asset as of the beginning of the applicable recognition period over the adjusted basis of the asset at that time.      Any item of income that is properly taken into account during the applicable recognition period but is attributable to periods before the applicable recognition period.      Generally, recognized built-in loss includes the following items.    Any loss recognized during the applicable recognition period on the disposition of any asset to the extent the corporation establishes that:    The asset was held by the corporation as of the beginning of the applicable recognition period; and   The loss doesn't exceed the excess of the adjusted basis of the asset as of the beginning of the applicable recognition period, over the FMV of the asset as of that time.      Any amount that is allowed as a deduction during the applicable recognition period (determined without regard to any carryover) but is attributable to periods before the applicable recognition period.      For details, see section 1374(d) and Regulations section 1.1374-4. The corporation must show on an attachment its total net recognized built-in gain and list separately any capital gain or loss and ordinary gain or loss.     Line 17 Figure taxable income by completing lines 1 through 28 of Form 1120. Follow the instructions for Form 1120. Enter the amount from line 28 of Form 1120 on line 17 of Schedule D. Attach to Schedule D the Form 1120 computation or other worksheet used to figure taxable income. For corporations figuring the built-in gains tax for separate groups of assets, taxable income must be apportioned to each group of assets in proportion to the net recognized built-in gain for each group of assets. For details, see Regulations section 1.1374-8.  Note. Taxable income is figured as provided in section 1375(b)(1)(B) and is generally figured in the same manner as taxable income for line 9 of the Excess Net Passive Income Tax Worksheet for Line 22a in the Instructions for Form 1120-S.        Line 18 If, for any tax year in the recognition period, the amount on line 16 exceeds the taxable income on line 17, the excess is treated as a recognized built-in gain in the succeeding tax year. This carryover provision applies only in the case of an S corporation that made its election to be an S corporation after March 30, 1988. See section 1374(d)(2)(B). For corporations figuring the built-in gains tax for separate groups of assets, don’t use the amount from Schedule B, line 8. Instead, figure the amount of net unrealized built-in gain separately for each group of assets.     Line 19 Enter the section 1374(b)(2) deduction. Generally, this is any net operating loss carryforward or capital loss carryforward (to the extent of net capital gain included in recognized built-in gain for the tax year) either arising in tax years for which the corporation was a C corporation or acquired in a transferred-basis acquisition (defined earlier). The section 1374(b)(2) deduction must be figured and applied separately for each separate group of assets. See section 1374(b)(2) and Regulations section 1.1374-5.     Line 22 Enter the section 1374(b)(3) credit. Generally, this is any general business credit arising in tax years for which the corporation was a C corporation or acquired in a transferred-basis acquisition (defined earlier). The section 1374(b)(3) credit must be figured and applied separately for each separate group of assets. Section 1374(b)(3) business credit and minimum tax credit carryforwards from C corporation years are subject to the business credit limitation in section 38(c) and the AMT credit limitation in section 53(c), as modified by Regulations section 1.1374-6(b).    The AMT refundable credit provisions do not apply to S corporations. See sections 1371(b)(1) and 1374(b)(3)(B).     Line 23 The built-in gains tax is treated as a loss sustained by the corporation during the same tax year. The character of the deemed loss is determined by allocating the loss proportionately among the net recognized built-in gains giving rise to the tax and attributing the character of each net recognized built-in gain to the allocable portion of the loss. Deduct the tax attributable to the following.    Short-term capital gain as short-term capital loss on Schedule D, line 6.   Long-term capital gain as long-term capital loss on Schedule D, line 14.   Ordinary income as a deduction for taxes on Form 1120-S, line 12.         "

Phasing out of investment credit for wind facilities. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 has extended and reduced investment credit by 40% for facilities the construction of which begins in 2020. See Line 12z, later.    Phasing out of certain investment credits. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 has implemented the phasing out of the investment credit for solar illumination and solar energy property.

See Line 12v, later.        Reminder The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 has implemented the phasing out of the investment credit for wind facilities. The credit for wind facilities is reduced by 60% for facilities the construction of which began in 2019. See Line 12aa, later.      General Instructions      Purpose of Form Use Form 3468 to claim the investment credit. The investment credit consists of the rehabilitation, energy, qualifying advanced coal project, qualifying gasification project, and qualifying advanced energy project credits. If you file electronically, you must send in a paper Form 8453, U.S. Individual Income Tax Transmittal for an IRS e-file Return, if attachments are required to Form 3468.     Investment Credit Property Investment credit property is any depreciable or amortizable property that qualifies for the rehabilitation credit, energy credit, qualifying advanced coal project credit, qualifying gasification project credit, or qualifying advanced energy project credit. You can't claim a credit for property that is:    Used mainly outside the United States (except for property described in section 168(g)(4));   Used by a governmental unit or foreign person or entity (except for a qualified rehabilitated building leased to that unit, person, or entity; and property used under a lease with a term of less than 6 months);   Used by a tax-exempt organization (other than a section 521 farmers' cooperative) unless the property is used mainly in an unrelated trade or business or is a qualified rehabilitated building leased by the organization;   Used for lodging or in the furnishing of lodging (see section 50(b)(2) for exceptions); or   Certain MACRS business property to the extent it has been expensed under section 179.          Qualified Progress Expenditures Qualified progress expenditures are those expenditures made before the property is placed in service and for which the taxpayer has made an election to treat the expenditures as progress expenditures. Qualified progress expenditure property is any property that is being constructed by or for the taxpayer and which (a) has a normal construction period of 2 years or more, and (b) it is reasonable to believe that the property will be new investment credit property in the hands of the taxpayer when it is placed in service. The placed-in-service requirement doesn't apply to qualified progress expenditures. Qualified progress expenditures for:    Self-constructed property means the amount that is properly chargeable (during the tax year) to a capital account with respect to that property; or   Non-self-constructed property means the lesser of: (a) the amount paid (during the tax year) to another person for the construction of the property, or (b) the amount that represents the proportion of the overall cost to the taxpayer of the construction by the other person which is properly attributable to that portion of the construction which is completed during the tax year.      For more information on qualified progress expenditures, see section 46(d) (as in effect on November 4, 1990). For details on qualified progress expenditures for the rehabilitation credit, see section 47(d).     At-Risk Limit for Individuals and Closely Held Corporations The cost or basis of property for investment credit purposes may be limited if you borrowed against the property and are protected against loss, or if you borrowed money from a person who is related or who has an interest (other than as a creditor) in the business activity. The cost or basis must be reduced by the amount of the nonqualified nonrecourse financing related to the property as of the close of the tax year in which the property is placed in service. If, at the close of a tax year following the year property was placed in service, the nonqualified nonrecourse financing for any property has increased or decreased, then the credit base for the property changes accordingly. The changes may result in an increased credit or a recapture of the credit in the year of the change. See sections 49 and 465 for details.     Recapture of Credit You may have to refigure the investment credit and recapture all or a portion of it if:    You dispose of investment credit property before the end of 5 full years after the property was placed in service (recapture period);   You change the use of the property before the end of the recapture period so that it no longer qualifies as investment credit property;   The business use of the property decreases before the end of the recapture period so that it no longer qualifies (in whole or in part) as investment credit property;   Any building to which section 47(d) applies will no longer be a qualified rehabilitated building when placed in service;   Any property to which section 48(b), 48A(b)(3), 48B(b)(3), or 48C(b)(2) applies will no longer qualify as investment credit property when placed in service;   Before the end of the recapture period, your proportionate interest is reduced by more than one-third in an S corporation, partnership, estate, or trust that allocated the cost or basis of property to you for which you claimed a credit;   You return leased property (on which you claimed a credit) to the lessor before the end of the recapture period;   A net increase in the amount of nonqualified nonrecourse financing occurs for any property to which section 49(a)(1) applied;   A grant under section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 was made for section 48 property for which a credit was allowed for progress expenditures before the grant was made. Recapture is applicable to those amounts previously included in the qualified basis for an energy credit, including progress expenditures, that also are the basis for the 1603 grant; or   A grant under section 9023 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was made for investment for which a credit was determined under section 48D (as in effect before its repeal on March 23, 2018) before the grant was made.       Exceptions to recapture. Recapture of the investment credit doesn't apply to any of the following.     A transfer due to the death of the taxpayer.   A transfer between spouses or incident to divorce under section 1041. However, a later disposition by the transferee is subject to recapture to the same extent as if the transferor had disposed of the property at the later date.   A transaction to which section 381(a) applies (relating to certain acquisitions of the assets of one corporation by another corporation).   A mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business if:    The property is retained as investment credit property in that trade or business, and   The taxpayer retains a substantial interest in that trade or business.          A mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business includes a corporation that elects to be an S corporation and a corporation whose S election is revoked or terminated. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 4255.    See section 46(g)(4) (as in effect on November 4, 1990), and related regulations, if you made a withdrawal from a capital construction fund set up under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to pay the principal of any debt incurred in connection with a vessel on which you claimed investment credit. Any required recapture is reported on Form 4255. For details, see Form 4255, Recapture of Investment Credit.      Specific Instructions      Generally, (a) an estate or trust whose entire qualified rehabilitation expenditures or bases in energy property are allocated to beneficiaries, (b) an S corporation, or (c) a partnership does not have to complete and attach Form 3468 to its tax return. However, if the estate or trust, S corporation, or partnership is the owner of or passing through qualified rehabilitation expenditures for a certified historic structure, the entity must complete lines 11h and 11i of the form and attach it to its tax return even if the credit is not being claimed by the entity. See Shareholders of S Corporations, Partners of Partnerships, and Beneficiaries of Estates and Trusts below for information that the entity must provide when allocating the credit.    Shareholders of S Corporations, Partners of Partnerships, and Beneficiaries of Estates and Trusts If you are a shareholder, partner, or beneficiary of the designated pass-through entity, the entity will provide to you the information necessary to complete the following.

Information Regarding the Election To Treat the Lessee as the Purchaser of Investment Credit Property Generally, for purposes of eligibility for and figuring the amount of the investment credit, a lessor of property may elect to treat the lessee as having acquired the property. Once the election is made, the lessee will be entitled to an investment credit for that property for the tax year in which the property is placed in service and the lessor generally will not be entitled to such a credit. If the leased property is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be investment credit property, the property generally will be subject to the recapture rules for early dispositions. The lessor will provide the lessee with all the information needed to complete lines 11h and 11i, if applicable. For information on making the election, see section 48(d) (as in effect on November 4, 1990) and related regulations.

Qualified investment for any tax year is the basis of eligible property placed in service by the taxpayer during the tax year which is part of a qualifying advanced coal project. Eligible property is limited to property which can be depreciated or amortized and which was constructed, reconstructed, or erected and completed by the taxpayer; or which is acquired by the taxpayer if the original use of such property commences with the taxpayer.   Basis reduction for certain financing. If property is financed in whole or in part by subsidized energy financing or by tax-exempt private activity bonds, the amount that you can claim as basis is the basis that would otherwise be allowed multiplied by a fraction that is 1 reduced by a second fraction, the numerator of which is that portion of the basis allocable to such financing or proceeds, and the denominator of which is the basis of the property. For example, if the basis of the property is $100,000 and the portion allocable to such financing or proceeds is $20,000, the fraction of the basis that you may claim the credit on is 4/5 (that is, 1 minus $20,000/$100,000). Subsidized energy financing means financing provided under a federal, state, or local program, a principal purpose of which is to provide subsidized financing for projects designed to conserve or produce energy.        Line 5a    Enter the qualified investment in integrated gasification combined cycle property placed in service during the tax year for projects described in section 48A(d)(3)(B)(i). Eligible property is any property which is part of a qualifying advanced coal project using an integrated gasification combined cycle and is necessary for the gasification of coal, including any coal handling and gas separation equipment. Integrated gasification combined cycle is an electric generation unit that produces electricity by converting coal to synthesis gas, which in turn is used to fuel a combined-cycle plant to produce electricity from both a combustion turbine (including a combustion turbine/fuel cell hybrid) and a steam turbine.        Line 5b    Enter the qualified investment in advanced coal-based generation technology property placed in service during the tax year for projects described in section 48A(d)(3)(B)(ii). Eligible property is any property that is part of a qualifying advanced coal project (defined earlier) not using an integrated gasification combined cycle.        Line 5c    Enter the qualified investment in advanced coal-based generation technology property placed in service during the tax year for projects described in section 48A(d)(3)(B)(iii). Eligible property is any certified property located in the United States and that is part of a qualifying advanced coal project (defined earlier) which has equipment that separates and sequesters at least 65% of the project's total carbon dioxide emissions. This percentage increases to 70% if the credits are later reallocated by the IRS. The credit will be recaptured if a project fails to attain or maintain the carbon dioxide separation and sequestration requirements. For details, see section 48A(i) and Notice 2011-24, 2011-14 I.R.B. 603, available at IRS.gov/irb/2011-14_IRB#NOT-2011-24.      Qualifying Gasification Project Credit A qualifying gasification project is a project that:    Employs gasification technology (as defined in section 48B(c)(2)),   Is carried out by an eligible entity (as defined in section 48B(c)(7)), and   Includes a qualified investment of which an amount not to exceed $650 million is certified under the qualifying gasification program as eligible for credit.      The total amount of credits that may be allocated under the qualifying gasification project program may not exceed $600 million. For more information on the qualifying gasification project and the qualifying gasification program, see Notice 2009-23, 2009-16 I.R.B. 802, available at IRS.gov/irb/2009-16_IRB#NOT-2009-23, which is amplified by Notice 2014-81, 2014-53 I.R.B. 1001, available at IRS.gov/irb/2014-53_IRB#NOT-2014-81.

If property is financed in whole or in part by subsidized energy financing or by tax-exempt private activity bonds, figure the credit by using the basis of such property reduced under the rules described in Basis reduction for certain financing, earlier.        Line 6a    Enter the qualified investment in qualifying gasification project property (defined above) placed in service during the tax year for which credits were allocated or reallocated after October 3, 2008, and that includes equipment that separates and sequesters at least 75% of the project's carbon dioxide emissions. Qualified investment is the basis of eligible property placed in service during the tax year that is part of a qualifying gasification project. For purposes of this credit, eligible property includes any property that is part of a qualifying gasification project and necessary for the gasification technology of such project. The IRS is required to recapture the benefit of any allocated credit if a project fails to attain or maintain these carbon dioxide separation and sequestration requirements. See section 48B(f) and Notice 2011-24.        Line 6b    Enter the qualified investment, other than line 6a, in qualifying gasification project property (defined above) placed in service during the tax year.      Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit To be eligible for the qualifying advanced energy project credit, some or all of the qualified investment in the qualifying advanced energy project must be certified by the IRS under section 48C(d). For more information on certification, see Notice 2009-72, 2009-37 I.R.B. 325, available at IRS.gov/irb/2009-37_IRB#NOT-2009-72 and Notice 2013-12, 2013-10 I.R.B. 543, available at IRS.gov/irb/2013-10_IRB#NOT-2013-12.       Line 7    Enter the qualified investment in qualifying advanced energy project property placed in service during the tax year, that is part of a qualifying advanced energy project. Qualified investment is the basis of eligible property placed in service during the tax year that is part of a qualifying advanced energy project. Qualifying advanced energy project means a project that re-equips, expands, or establishes a manufacturing facility for the production of:    Property designed to be used to produce energy from the sun, wind, geothermal deposits (within the meaning of section 613(e)(2)), or other renewable resources;   Fuel cells, microturbines, or an energy storage system for use with electric or hybrid-electric motor vehicles;   Electric grids to support the transmission of intermittent sources of renewable energy, including storage of the energy;   Property designed to capture and sequester carbon dioxide emissions;   Property designed to refine or blend renewable fuels or to produce energy conservation technologies (including energy-conserving lighting technologies and smart grid technologies);   New qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles (as defined in section 30D), or components that are designed specifically for use with those vehicles, including electric motors, generators, and power control units; and   Other advanced energy property designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.      A qualifying advanced energy project doesn't include any portion of a project for the production of any property that is used in the refining or blending of any transportation fuel (other than renewable fuels).  Eligible property. Eligible property is property that is necessary for the production of property described in section 48C(c)(1)(A)(i), for which depreciation or amortization is available and is tangible personal property or other tangible property (not including a building or its structural components), but only if the property is used as an integral part of the qualifying advanced energy project.    Transitional rule. Enter only the basis:    Attributable to constructed, reconstruction, or erection by the taxpayer after February 17, 2009;   Of property acquired and placed in service after February 17, 2009; and    Only to the extent of the qualified investment (as determined under section 46(c) and (d) as in effect on November 4, 1990) with respect to qualified progress expenditures made after February 17, 2009.              Line 8    Reserved for future use.      Credit From Cooperatives       Line 9    Patrons, including cooperatives that are patrons in other cooperatives, enter the unused investment credit from the qualifying advanced coal project credit, qualifying gasification project credit, or qualifying advanced energy project credit allocated from cooperatives. If you are a cooperative, see the instructions for Form 3800, Part III, line 1a, for allocating the investment credit to your patrons.      Rehabilitation Credit You are allowed a credit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures made for any qualified rehabilitated building. You must reduce your basis by the amount of the credit determined for the tax year. If the adjusted basis of the building is determined in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of a person other than the taxpayer, see Regulations section 1.48-12(b)(2)(viii) for additional information that must be attached.       Qualified Rehabilitated Building    To be a qualified rehabilitated building, your building must meet all five of the following requirements.    The building must be a certified historic structure. A certified historic structure is any building (a) listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or (b) located in a registered historic district (as defined in section 47(c)(3)(B)) and certified by the Secretary of the Interior as being of historic significance to the district. Certification requests are made through your State Historic Preservation Officer on National Park Service (NPS) Form 10-168, Historic Preservation Certification Application. The request for certification should be made prior to physical work beginning on the building. For pre-1936 buildings under transition rule, see Transitional rule for amounts paid or incurred after 2017, later.   The building must be substantially rehabilitated. A building is considered substantially rehabilitated if your qualified rehabilitation expenditures during a self-selected 24-month period that ends with or within your tax year are more than the greater of $5,000 or your adjusted basis in the building and its structural components. Figure adjusted basis on the first day of the 24-month period or the first day of your holding period, whichever is later. If you are rehabilitating the building in phases under a written architectural plan and specifications that were completed before the rehabilitation began, substitute ""60-month period"" for ""24-month period.""   Depreciation must be allowable with respect to the building. Depreciation isn't allowable if the building is permanently retired from service. If the building is damaged, it isn't considered permanently retired from service where the taxpayer repairs and restores the building and returns it to actual service within a reasonable period of time.   The building must have been placed in service before the beginning of rehabilitation. This requirement is met if the building was placed in service by any person at any time before the rehabilitation began.   For a building under transition rule, (a) at least 75% of the external walls must be retained with 50% or more kept in place as external walls, and (b) at least 75% of the existing internal structural framework of the building must be retained in place.             Qualified Rehabilitation Expenditures    To be qualified rehabilitation expenditures, your expenditures must meet all six of the following requirements.    The expenditures must be for (a) nonresidential real property, (b) residential rental property (but only if a certified historic structure; see Regulations section 1.48-1(h)), or (c) real property that has a class life of more than 12.5 years.   The expenditures must be incurred in connection with the rehabilitation of a qualified rehabilitated building.   The expenditures must be capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method.   The expenditures can't include the costs of acquiring or enlarging any building.   If the expenditures are in connection with the rehabilitation of a certified historic structure or a building in a registered historic district, the rehabilitation must be certified by the Secretary of the Interior as being consistent with the historic character of the property or district in which the property is located. This requirement doesn't apply to a building in a registered historic district if (a) the building isn't a certified historic structure, (b) the Secretary of the Interior certifies that the building isn't of historic significance to the district, and (c) if the certification in (b) occurs after the rehabilitation began, the taxpayer certifies in good faith that he or she wasn't aware of that certification requirement at the time the rehabilitation began.   The expenditures can't include any costs allocable to the part of the property that is (or may reasonably be expected to be) tax-exempt use property (as defined in section 168(h) except that ""50 percent"" shall be substituted for ""35 percent"" in paragraph (1)(B)(iii)). This exclusion doesn't apply for line 11d.             Line 11    For credit purposes, the expenditures generally are taken into account for the tax year in which the qualified rehabilitated building is placed in service. However, with certain exceptions, you may elect to take the expenditures into account for the tax year in which they were paid (or, for a self-rehabilitated building, when capitalized) if (a) the normal rehabilitation period for the building is at least 2 years, and (b) it is reasonable to expect that the building will be a qualified rehabilitated building when placed in service. For details, see section 47(d). To make this election, check the box on line 11a. The credit, as a percent of expenditures paid or incurred during the tax year for any qualified rehabilitated building, depends on the type of structure and its location.  Transitional rule for amounts paid or incurred after 2017. The 10% credit for pre-1936 buildings no longer applies and the 20% credit for a certified historic structure is modified generally to allow 100% of qualified rehabilitation expenditures ratably over a 5-year period for amounts paid or incurred after 2017. For qualified rehabilitation expenditures paid or incurred during the transitional period stated below, the taxpayer can claim the 10% credit for pre-1936 buildings and the 20% credit for a certified historic structure (under section 47(a), as in effect before December 22, 2017). The transitional rule applies to amounts paid or incurred as follows. In the case of qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to any building: (A) owned or leased by the taxpayer during the entirety of the period after 2017, and (B) with respect to which the 24-month period selected by the taxpayer under clause (i) of section 47(c)(1)(B) (as in effect after December 21, 2017), or the 60-month period applicable under clause (ii) of such section, begins not later than 180 days after December 22, 2017, the transitional rule applies to expenditures paid or incurred after the end of the tax year in which the 24-month period, or the 60-period, referred to in subparagraph (B) ends. If you have more than one property that qualifies for the rehabilitation credit, attach a schedule showing the type of property (pre-1936 building or certified historic structure), NPS number, date of final certification, and the partnership employer identification number (EIN), if applicable. Also, indicate if the transitional rule applies.         Line 11h    If you are claiming a credit for a certified historic structure on line 11f or 11g, enter the assigned NPS project number on line 11h. If the qualified rehabilitation expenditures are from an S corporation, partnership, estate, or trust, enter on line 11h the EIN of the pass-through entity instead of the assigned NPS project number, and skip line 11i and the instructions below. The lessor will provide the lessee with the NPS project number to enter on line 11h.        Line 11i    Enter the date of the final certification of completed work received from the Secretary of the Interior on line 11i. If the final certification hasn't been received by the time the tax return is filed for a year in which the credit is claimed, attach a copy of the first page of NPS Form 10-168, Historic Preservation Certification Application (Part 2—Description of Rehabilitation), with an indication that it was received by the Department of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer, together with proof that the building is a certified historic structure (or that such status has been requested). After the final certification of completed work has been received, file Form 3468 with the first income tax return filed after receipt of the certification and enter the assigned NPS project number and the date of the final certification of completed work on the appropriate lines on the form. Also attach an explanation, and indicate the amount of credit claimed in prior years. If you fail to receive final certification of completed work prior to the date that is 30 months after the date that you filed the tax return on which the credit was claimed, you must submit a written statement to the IRS stating that fact before the last day of the 30th month. You will be asked to consent to an agreement under section 6501(c)(4) extending the period of assessment for any tax relating to the time for which the credit was claimed. Mail to: Internal Revenue Service Technical Services 31 Hopkins Plaza, Room 1108 Baltimore, MD 21201   You must retain a copy of the final certification of completed work as long as its contents may be needed for the administration of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code. If the final certification is denied by the Department of the Interior, the credit is disallowed for any tax year in which it was claimed, and you must file an amended return if necessary. See Regulations section 1.48-12(d)(7)(ii) for details.      Energy Credit To qualify as energy property, property must:    Meet the performance and quality standards, if any, that have been prescribed by regulations and are in effect at the time the property is acquired;   Be property for which depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable; and   Be property either:    The construction, reconstruction, or erection of which is completed by the taxpayer; or   Acquired by the taxpayer if the original use of such property commences with the taxpayer.         Energy property doesn't include any property acquired before February 14, 2008, or to the extent of basis attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection before February 14, 2008, that is public utility property, as defined by section 46(f)(5) (as in effect on November 4, 1990), and related regulations. You must reduce the basis of energy property by 50% of the energy credit determined. You must reduce the basis of energy property used for figuring the credit by any amount attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures.  Basis reduction. If energy property (acquired before January 1, 2009, or to the extent of its basis attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection before January 1, 2009) is financed in whole or in part by subsidized energy financing or by tax-exempt private activity bonds, reduce the basis of such property under the rules described in Basis reduction for certain financing, earlier.

Qualified investment credit facility property is property that:    Is tangible personal property or other tangible property (not including a building or its structural components), but only if the property is used as an integral part of the qualified investment credit facility;   Is constructed, reconstructed, erected, or acquired by the taxpayer;   Depreciation or amortization is allowable; and   The original use begins with the taxpayer.    See section 48(a)(5) for details. A qualified investment credit facility is a facility that:   Note. If a taxpayer retrofits an energy property that previously received a credit under section 45 by satisfying the 80/20 Rule provided in section 7.05 of Notice 2018-59, 2018-28 I.R.B. 196, available at IRS.gov/irb/2018-28_IRB#NOT-2018-59, the taxpayer may claim an investment tax credit based on its investment. However, if the energy property is within the recapture period for the section 45 credit, the taxpayer may have to recapture all or part of such section 45 credit accordingly.    Is a qualified facility under section 45(d)(1), (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (9), or (11) that is placed in service after 2008 and the construction of which begins before January 1, 2021. See When construction begins below;   No credit has been allowed under section 45 for that facility (see Note below); and   An irrevocable election was made to treat the facility as energy property.       When construction begins. Two methods can be used to establish that construction of a qualified facility has begun.     Physical Work Test is satisfied when physical work of a significant nature begins and other requirements provided in section 4 of Notice 2018-59 are met.   Five Percent Safe Harbor is satisfied when a taxpayer pays or incurs (within the meaning of Regulations section 1.461-1(a)(1) and (2)) five percent or more of the total cost of the energy property and meets other requirements provided in section 5 of Notice 2018-59.      Although both methods can be used, only one method is needed to establish that construction of a qualified facility has begun. For energy property the construction of which begins, as determined under the earlier of the Physical Work Test or the Five Percent Safe Harbor, after December 31, 2018, construction will be deemed to have begun on the date the taxpayer first satisfies one of the two methods. The requirements to begin construction may be modified in certain limited circumstances involving significant national security concerns. See Notice 2019-43, 2019-31 I.R.B. 487, available at IRS.gov/irb/2019-31_IRB#NOT-2019-43, for details.  The election to treat a qualified facility as energy property is made by claiming the energy credit with respect to qualified investment credit facility property by completing Form 3468 and attaching it to your timely filed income tax return (including extensions) for the tax year that the property is placed in service. You must make a separate election for each qualified facility that is to be treated as a qualified investment credit facility. You also must attach a statement to the Form 3468 that includes the following information.    Your name, address, taxpayer identification number, and telephone number.   For each qualified investment credit facility include the following.    A detailed technical description of the facility, including generating capacity.   A detailed technical description of the energy property placed in service during the tax year as an integral part of the facility, including a statement that the property is an integral part of such facility.   The date that the energy property was placed in service.   An accounting of your basis in the energy property.   A depreciation schedule reflecting your remaining basis in the energy property after the energy credit is claimed.      A statement that you haven't and won’t claim a grant under section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 for new investment in the property for which you are claiming the energy credit.   A declaration, applicable to the statement and any accompanying documents, signed by you, or signed by a person currently authorized to bind you in such matters, in the following form: ""Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this statement, including accompanying documents, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, the facts presented in support of this statement are true, correct, and complete.""             Line 12y    Enter the basis of qualified wind facility property under section 45(d)(1) the construction of which began in 2017 and was placed in service during the tax year.        Line 12z    Enter the basis of qualified wind facility property under section 45(d)(1) the construction of which began in 2018 or 2020, and was placed in service during the tax year.        Line 12aa    Enter the basis of qualified wind facility property under section 45(d)(1) the construction of which began in 2019 and was placed in service during the tax year.        Line 13    Patrons, including cooperatives that are patrons in other cooperatives, enter the unused investment credit from the rehabilitation credit or energy credit allocated from cooperatives.

200,Instructions for Form 5310-A (11/2010),"   Instructions for Form 5310-A (11/2010) Notice of Plan Merger or Consolidation, Spinoff, or Transfer of Plan Assets or Liabilities; Notice of Qualified Separate Lines of Business  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 11/2010      Instructions for Form 5310-A - Introductory Material    What's New The form and instructions have undergone revisions in the format and the information required. Review these documents before completing the notice.    General Instructions    Purpose of Form Form 5310-A is used by employers to give notice of:  A plan merger or consolidation that is the combining of two or more plans into a single plan. A plan spinoff that is the splitting of a single plan into two or more spinoff plans. A plan transfer of plan assets or liabilities to another plan that is the splitting off of a portion of the assets or liabilities of the transferor plan and the concurrent acquisition or assumption of these split-off assets or liabilities by the transferee plan. Qualified separate lines of business (QSLOBs).      Note. An IRS determination letter will not be issued when a Form 5310-A is filed.        Who Must File      Pension plan, profit-sharing plan, or other deferred compensation plan. Any sponsor or plan administrator of a pension, profit-sharing, or other deferred compensation plan (except a multi-employer plan covered by Public Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) insurance) should file this form for a plan merger or consolidation, a spinoff, or a transfer of plan assets or liabilities to another plan. See section 6058(b).   Note. This form must be filed for each plan with a separate employer identification and plan number if that plan is involved in a merger or transfer of plan assets or liabilities. This includes plans that were not in existence before the plan merger and plans that cease to exist after the plan merger. In the case of a plan spinoff, file Form 5310-A only for the plan in existence before the spinoff.    Qualified separate lines of business. The employer must file notice that it elects to be treated as operating QSLOBs or that it either modifies or revokes a previously filed notice. Only one notice per employer, within the meaning of sections 414(b), (c), and (m) is required.       Examples    Example One - Initial Notice Employer A is composed of four separate corporations that are treated as one employer within the meaning of section 414(b). Employer A treats each corporation as a separate line of business. The 2008 testing year is the first year for which Employer A elects to be treated as operating QSLOBs for the purpose of section 410(b) (see When To File for a definition of ""testing year""). Employer A must file Form 5310-A and provide information on each of the four QSLOBs on or before the notification date for the 2008 testing year (see When To File for a definition of ""notification date""). If the notice is not timely filed, Employer A is not treated as operating QSLOBs for purposes of the coverage rules for the 2008 testing year (see Part III ).     Example Two - Modification The facts are the same as in Example One. During the 2009 testing year, Employer A sold QSLOB four. Also, assume that Employer A timely filed Form 5310-A for the 2008 testing year. For the 2009 testing year, Employer A intends to treat QSLOBs one and two as a single QSLOB. Employer A must modify its initial notice by filing Form 5310-A on or before the notification date for the 2009 testing year, including a revised list of QSLOBs for line 11 of the form. If Employer A does not timely provide a new notice, the initial notice filed for the 2008 testing year will be treated as the only notice filed for the 2009 testing year (see Part III).     Example Three - Revocation The facts are the same as in Example Two. Assume that Employer A timely filed a new notice for the 2009 testing year. During 2010, Employer A elects not to treat itself as operating QSLOBs for the 2010 testing year. Employer A must revoke the last notice it filed (that is, the notice for the 2009 testing year). Employer A must revoke the notice filed for the 2009 testing year by filing Form 5310-A for the 2010 testing year and indicating on line 9 of the Form 5310-A that it is revoking a previously filed notice and is no longer testing on a QSLOB basis. If such notice is not filed on or before the notification date for the 2010 testing year, the notice filed for the 2009 testing year will be treated as the only notice filed for the 2010 testing year (see Part III).       Exceptions From Filing Notice of Plan Merger or Consolidation, Spinoff, or Transfer of Plan Assets or Liabilities   Direct rollover.   Do not file Form 5310-A for an eligible rollover distribution that is paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover as described in section 401(a)(31).     Plan merger or consolidation or spinoff.   Do not file Form 5310-A if the plan merger or consolidation or the spinoff complies with Regulations section 1.414(l)-1(d), (h), (m), or (n)(2).    Generally, these requirements will be satisfied in the following four situations:   Two or more defined contribution plans are merged and all of the following conditions are met:  The sum of the account balances in each plan prior to the merger (including unallocated forfeitures, an unallocated suspense account for excess annual additions, and an unallocated suspense account for an ESOP) equals the fair market value of the entire plan assets.  Example. Neither plan has an outstanding section 412(d) waiver balance. The assets of each plan are combined to form the assets of the plan as merged. Immediately after the merger, each participant in the plan has an account balance equal to the sum of the account balances the participant had in the plans immediately prior to the merger.    There is a spinoff of a defined contribution plan and all of the following conditions are met:  The sum of the account balances in the plan prior to the spinoff equals the fair market value of the entire plan assets.  Example. The plan does not have an outstanding section 412(d) waiver balance. The sum of the account balances for each of the participants in the resulting plan(s) equals the account balances of the participants in the plan before the spinoff. The assets in each of the plans immediately after the spinoff equal the sum of the account balances for all participants in that plan.  Example. The plan does not have unallocated accounts.    Two or more defined benefit plans are merged into one defined benefit plan and both of the following conditions are met:   The total liabilities (the present value of benefits whether or not vested) that are merged into the larger plan involved in the merger are less than 3% of the assets of the larger plan. This condition must be satisfied on at least 1 day in the larger plan's plan year during which the merger occurs. All previous mergers (including transfers from another plan) occurring in the same plan year are taken into account in determining the percentage of assets described above.  Example. Assume that a merger involving almost 3% of the assets of the larger plan occurs in the first month of the larger plan's plan year. In the fourth month of the larger plan's plan year, a second merger occurs involving liabilities equal to 2% of the assets of the larger plan. The total of both mergers exceeds 3% of the assets of the larger plan. As a result of the second merger, both mergers must be reported on Form 5310-A. Enter the date of the second merger on line 6g. Also, mergers occurring in previous plan years are taken into account in determining the percentage of assets above if the series of mergers is, in substance, one transaction with the merger occurring during the current plan year.  Aggregating mergers may cause a merger, for which a Form 5310-A was not initially required to be filed, to become reportable as a result of a subsequent merger. In this case, the merger(s) must be reported on the Form 5310-A filed for the subsequent merger.  The provisions of the larger plan that allocate assets at the time of termination must provide that, in the event of a spinoff or termination of the plan within 5 years following the merger, plan assets will be allocated first for the benefit of the participants in the other plan(s) to the extent of their benefits on a termination basis just prior to the merger.    There is a spinoff of a defined benefit plan into two or more defined benefit plans and both of the following conditions are met:  For each plan that results from the spinoff, other than the spunoff plan with the greatest value of plan assets after the spinoff, the value of the assets spun off is not less than the present value of the benefits spun off (whether or not vested). The value of the assets spun off to all the resulting spunoff plans (other than the spunoff plan with the greatest value of plan assets after the spinoff) plus other assets previously spun off (including transfers to another plan) during the plan year in which the spinoff occurs is less than 3% of the assets of the plan before the spinoff as of at least 1 day in that plan's plan year.  Example. Assume that a spinoff involving almost 3% of the assets of the plan occurs in the first month of the plan year. In the fourth month of the plan year a second spinoff occurs involving liabilities equal to 2% of the assets of the plan. The total of both spinoffs exceeds 3% of the plan assets. As a result of the second spinoff, Form 5310-A must be filed to report both spinoffs. Enter the date of the second spinoff on line 6g.      Spinoffs occurring in previous or subsequent plan years are taken into account in determining the percentage of assets spun off if such spinoffs are, in substance, one transaction with the spinoff occurring during the current plan year. Aggregating spinoffs may cause a spinoff, for which a Form 5310-A was not initially required to be filed, to become reportable as a result of a subsequent spinoff. In this case, report the spinoff(s) on the Form 5310-A filed for the subsequent spinoff. Enter the date of the subsequent spinoff on line 6g.   Transfer of Plan Assets or Liabilities.    A transfer of plan assets or liabilities is considered a combination of separate plan spinoffs and mergers.   Do not file Form 5310-A for:    The transferor plan in a transfer transaction if the assets transferred satisfy the spinoff conditions in 2 or 4 above.  The transferee plan in a transfer transaction if the plan liabilities transferred satisfy the merger conditions in 1 or 3 above.      Note. In some situations, the transferor plan may have to file Form 5310-A but not the transferee plan, or the transferee plan may have to file but not the transferor plan.        Examples    Transfer of Plan Assets or Liabilities Plans A, B, and C are separate plans within the meaning of section 414(l). A portion of the assets and liabilities of both Plan B and Plan C will be transferred to Plan A. None of the plans are excluded from filing under the exceptions from filing listed above. In this situation all 3 plans must:  File a completed Form 5310-A. Enter code 4 (notice of a transfer of plan assets or liabilities) as the reason for filing. Complete all parts of Part I and II of the form.  For Plan A, line 6 of the form will show information regarding Plan B and an attached statement with the line 6 information for Plan C. Plan B and Plan C will each enter the information regarding Plan A on line 6.     Plan Merger Plans A, B, and C are separate plans within the meaning of section 414(l). Plans A, B, and C are being merged. Assets and liabilities from each plan will be merged into Plan D, a new plan that was established for the purpose of effecting the merger. None of the plans are excluded from filing under the exceptions from filing above. In this situation, four separate Forms 5310-A must be filed. Because Plan D is receiving assets from Plans A, B, and C, Plan D must file a complete Form 5310-A, enter code 2 (notice of a plan merger) as the reason for filing, and complete all of Parts I and II of the form. Line 6 of the form will show information regarding Plan A and an attached statement with the line 6 information for Plans B and C. Plans A, B, and C are merging with Plan D. Plans A, B, and C will each file a separate Form 5310-A completed as follows: Enter code 2 as the reason for filing, complete all of Parts I and II, and enter the information regarding Plan D on line 6.       When To File    File Form 5310-A at least 30 days prior to a plan merger or consolidation, spinoff, or transfer of plan assets or liabilities to another plan. If you are filing Form 5310-A to notify the IRS that the employer treats itself as operating QSLOBs or the employer is modifying or revoking a previously filed notice, file Form 5310-A on or before the notification date for the testing year. The ""notification date"" for a testing year is the later of: (a) October 15 of the year following the testing year, or (b) the 15th day of the 10th month after the close of the plan year of the plan of the employer that begins earliest in the testing year. ""Testing year"" means the calendar year.        Penalties There is a penalty for the late filing of a Form 5310-A to report a plan merger or consolidation, spinoff, or transfer of plan assets or liabilities. The penalty is $25 a day for each day the Form 5310-A is late (up to a maximum of $15,000). The form is late if it is not filed at least 30 days before the plan merger or consolidation, spinoff, or transfer of plan assets or liabilities.

Proc. 93-40, 1993-2 C.B. 535, contains procedures relating to the notification requirements of section 414(r)(2)(B). Notice given by an employer applies to all plans maintained by the employer for plan years beginning in the testing year. Once the notification date (see When To File) for a testing year has passed, the employer is deemed to have irrevocably elected to apply the specified section(s) on the basis of QSLOBs for all plan years beginning in the testing year.  In addition, after the notification date, notice cannot be modified, withdrawn, or revoked, and will be treated as applying to subsequent testing years unless the employer takes timely action to provide new notice (see examples under Who Must File). Timely action will be deemed to have been taken any time prior to the notification date for any subsequent testing year.  Line 7a.  If you previously filed a notice of QSLOB for a testing year, enter the first testing year for which such notice applied on line 7b. Enter the date the notice was filed on line 7c.    Line 8.  Enter the first testing year for which this notice applies. See When To File for the definition of ""testing year.""                 Line 9.  Indicate whether you are filing this form to give notice that you are no longer testing on a QSLOB basis. If your answer to line 9 is ""Yes,"" complete line 10 and skip lines 11 and 12. Answer line 10 based on the previously filed notice that you are now revoking. If your answer to line 9 is ""No,"" complete lines 10 through 12. See Who Must File for an example of a revocation.     Line 10.  Section 414(r) provides rules for determining whether an employer operates QSLOBs for purposes of applying sections 410(b) (relating to minimum coverage), 401(a)(26) (relating to minimum participation rules), and 129(d)(8) (relating to dependent care assistance programs). If you are treated as operating QSLOBs under section 414(r), you will be permitted to apply the aforementioned Code provisions separately for the employees in each QSLOB. Check the appropriate box(es) for the section(s) you are testing on a QSLOB basis. See instructions for line 9 to determine how to answer this question if you answered ""Yes"" to line 9.    Line 11.  Attach a list identifying the part or parts of the employer that make up each QSLOB of the employer. The list should include, for example, the type of business or industry in which the QSLOB is involved, the business unit (such as corporation, partnership, or division) the qualified line of business comprises, and the name (formal or informal) of the QSLOB.    Line 12.  Enter the information requested on lines 12a through 12e. If there is more than one plan, attach a separate statement showing the information requested on lines 12a through 12e for each plan.    Line 12b.  Enter the date of the determination letter, if any. Otherwise, leave blank.    Line 12c.  If the plan is a master or prototype or volume submitter plan, enter the date of the letter and the serial number or the advisory letter number, as applicable.    Line 12d.  Enter the appropriate date of any pending letter request. If this question is not applicable, leave blank.    Line 12e.  List on this line the QSLOBs identified on line 11 that have employees benefiting under the plan. If you need additional space to list the QSLOBs, use the area below line 12e.

220,Instructions for Form 8027 (2019),"   Instructions for Form 8027 (2019)  Employer's Annual Information Return of Tip Income and Allocated Tips    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    2019        Instructions for Form 8027 - Introductory Material       Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 8027 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form8027.     Reminders      You must check either the ""Yes"" or ""No"" box under employer's name and address to indicate whether or not the establishment accepts credit cards, debit cards, or other charges. If the ""Yes"" box is checked, lines 1 and 2 of Form 8027 must be completed, and you must enter an amount, even if zero, on lines 1 and 2. Also see the instructions for lines 1 and 2.   You can complete the optional Worksheet for Determining if You Must File Form 8027 for Calendar Year 2019, later, to determine if you must file Form 8027.   You may want to use the Employer's Optional Worksheet for Tipped Employees, later, as a means of determining if your employees are reporting all of their tip income to you.   For information about the credit for employer social security and Medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips, see Form 8846. Also see section 6 of Pub. 15 for more information about tips.   You can advise your employees to see Pub. 531 or use the IRS Interactive Tax Assistant at IRS.gov/TipIncome for help in determining if their tip income is taxable and for information about how to report tip income.       Electronic filing.  If you're required to file 250 or more Forms 8027, you must file electronically. Information returns are filed electronically through the Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE) system. Go to IRS.gov/FIRE for more information. See Pub. 1239 for more information about filing Form 8027 electronically. We encourage you to file electronically even if you're not required to file 250 or more Forms 8027. Recordkeeping.  You must keep records sufficient to substantiate any information returns, employer statements to employees, or tip allocations. The records must be kept for 3 years after the due date of the return or statement to which they relate. Certified professional employer organizations (CPEOs).  The Stephen Beck, Jr., ABLE Act of 2014 required the IRS to establish a voluntary certification program for professional employer organizations (PEOs). PEOs handle various payroll administration and tax reporting responsibilities for their business clients and are typically paid a fee based on payroll costs. To become and remain certified under the certification program, CPEOs must meet various requirements described in sections 3511 and 7705 and related published guidance. A CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer of any individual who performs services for a customer of the CPEO and is covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between the CPEO and the customer (CPEO contract), but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. For purposes of Form 8027, the customer for whom a work site employee performs services (that is, the employer who operates a large food or beverage establishment) is considered the employer and must file Form 8027. The CPEO must furnish to the customer any information necessary to complete this form. For more information about CPEOs, go to IRS.gov/CPEO. Also see Rev. Proc. 2017-14, 2017-3 I.R.B. 426, available at IRS.gov/irb/2017-03_IRB#RP-2017-14.     General Instructions      Purpose of Form Employers must annually report to the IRS receipts and tips from their large food or beverage establishments. Employers use Form 8027 to report that information. In addition, employers use Form 8027 to determine allocated tips for tipped employees. These instructions give you some background information about Form 8027. They tell you who must file Form 8027, when and where to file it, and how to fill it out line by line.     All employees receiving $20 or more a month in cash tips must report 100% of their tips to you in a written report. Cash tips include tips paid by cash, check, debit card, and credit card. The report should include tips you paid over to the employee for charge customers, tips the employee received directly from customers, and tips received from other employees under any tip-sharing arrangement.    Who Must File You must file Form 8027 if you're an employer who operates a large food or beverage establishment. A large food or beverage establishment is a food or beverage operation:    That is located in the 50 states or in the District of Columbia,   Where tipping of food or beverage employees by customers is customary, and   Whose employer normally employed more than 10 employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year. We call this the 10-employee test. To determine if you meet the 10-employee test, see the Worksheet for Determining if You Must File Form 8027 for Calendar Year 2019, later.       Food or beverage operation. A food or beverage operation is any business activity which provides food or beverages for consumption on the premises, other than fast food operations. An operation is a fast food operation only if its customers order, pick up, and pay for food or beverages at a counter or window and then carry the food or beverages to another location (either on or off the premises). Some people call food or beverage operations venues, stores, rooms, outlets, or cost centers. If you provide food or beverages at more than one location, the activity at each separate location is considered to be a separate food or beverage operation and a separate Form 8027 is filed for each location. You could also have more than one food or beverage operation within a single building. Each activity conducted within a single building is treated as a separate location if the customers of the activity, while being provided with food or beverages, occupy an area separate from that occupied by customers of other activities and the gross receipts from the activity are recorded separately. For example, a gourmet restaurant, a coffee shop, and a cocktail lounge in a hotel would each be treated as a separate food or beverage operation if gross receipts from each activity are recorded separately. In addition, an employer may treat different activities conducted in the identical place at different times as separate food or beverage operations if the gross receipts of the activities at each time are recorded separately. For example, a restaurant may record the gross receipts from its cafeteria-style lunch operation separately from the gross receipts of its full-service food or beverage operations.   Tipping of food or beverage employees by customers is customary. Generally, tipping isn't considered customary in a cafeteria-style operation or if at least 95% of total sales (other than carryout) had a service charge of 10% or more. See Regulations section 31.6053-3(j)(7) and (18) for more information. If tipping isn't considered customary, the food or beverage operation isn't a large food or beverage establishment. Service charges aren't tips; see Difference Between Service Charges and Tips, later.     Example. Good Food Restaurant is a soup-and-salad specialty business. Customers select food items at a buffet. They then pay and take their tray to a table. The restaurant employees clear the tables but also may help the customers if they need anything extra. Customers rarely leave a tip. Thus, tipping isn't customary at Good Food Restaurant. Therefore, Good Food Restaurant isn't a large food or beverage establishment and a Form 8027 isn't required.       Food or beverage employee. A food or beverage employee is an employee who provides services in connection with the provision of food or beverages. These employees include, but aren't limited to, waitstaff, bussers, bartenders, persons in charge of seating (such as a maitre d'), wine stewards, cooks, and kitchen help. Examples of employees who aren't food or beverage employees include, but aren't limited to, coat check persons, bellhops, and doormen.      Worksheet for Determining if You Must File Form 8027 for Calendar Year 2019 You can complete the optional worksheet to determine if you had more than 10 employees on a typical business day during 2018 and, therefore, must file Form 8027 for 2019. It is the average number of employee hours worked on a typical business day that determines whether or not you employed more than 10 employees. Completing this worksheet is only for the employer's information (don't send it to the IRS). You must consider the following when completing the worksheet.    Include employees at all of your food or beverage operations, even if an individual operation has fewer than 10 employees.         Include all employees at your food or beverage operations, not just food or beverage employees.         Don't include employees at fast food operations.         Don't apply the 10-employee test separately to each food or beverage operation.         Don't consider anyone who owns 50% or more in value of the stock of a corporation as an employee for the 10-employee test. See Regulations section 31.6053-3(j)(9) for more information.               1. Enter one-half of the total employee hours worked during the month in 2018 with the greatest aggregate gross receipts from food and beverages.     2. Enter the number of days opened for business during the month shown in line 1.     3. Enter one-half of the total employee hours worked during the month in 2018 with the least aggregate gross receipts from food and beverages.     4. Enter the number of days opened for business during the month shown in line 3.     5. Divide line 1 by line 2.     6. Divide line 3 by line 4.     7. Add lines 5 and 6. If line 7 is greater than 80 (hours), you must file Form 8027 for 2019.         If your answer on line 7 of the worksheet is more than 80 hours, then you meet the 10-employee test.  Example. Oak Co. operates five restaurants in the Midwest. Those working at the restaurants include food or beverage employees, coat check employees, and parking valet employees. Oak Co. must count all the employees working at all five of Oak Co.'s restaurants, and not just the food or beverage employees, to determine the 10-employee test. Oak Co. must not figure the 10-employee test separately for each operation.   Example. Rose Casino includes a fine dining restaurant, a café, a bar, and a dinner showroom. Rose Casino must count all employees at all these food or beverage operations for the 10-employee test, including the managers of the operations as well as the food or beverage employees. Rose Casino must not figure the 10-employee test separately for each operation.     If you meet the 10-employee test, file a separate Form 8027 for each food or beverage operation where tipping is customary. This is true even if an individual operation, when considered separately, doesn't have more than 10 employees on a typical business day.  Example. Continuing with the previous example, Rose Casino meets the 10-employee test. All four of the food or beverage operations meet the other tests, as they are located in the 50 states and tipping of food or beverage employees by customers is customary at each of the operations. Each of the four food or beverage activities record gross receipts separately and customers of each activity occupy an area separate from that occupied by customers of the other activities. Because each activity qualifies as a large food or beverage establishment, Rose Casino is required to file four Forms 8027 (a separate Form 8027 for the restaurant, the café, the bar, and the showroom) even if an individual activity has less than 10 employees.     If you're required to report for more than one establishment and you file Forms 8027 on paper, you must complete and file Form 8027-T, Transmittal of Employer's Annual Information Return of Tip Income and Allocated Tips, with Forms 8027. Attach Forms 8027 in establishment number order (lowest to highest). For more information on establishment numbers, see Establishment Number, later. Form 8027-T isn't filed with electronically filed Forms 8027.   New business. You're a new business if you opened a food or beverage operation during the year and you didn't operate any food or beverage operations during the preceding calendar year. File Form 8027 for a new food or beverage operation if, during any 2 consecutive calendar months, the average number of hours worked each business day by all employees is more than 80 hours. To figure the average number of employee hours worked each business day during a month, divide the total hours all employees worked during the month by the number of days the operation was open for business. After the test is met for 2 consecutive months, you must file a return covering the rest of the year, beginning with the next payroll period.      When To File File Form 8027 (and Form 8027-T when filing more than one paper Form 8027) by March 2, 2020. However, if you file electronically, the due date for Form 8027 is March 31, 2020.  Extension of time to file. Filers of Form 8027 submitted on paper or electronically may request an extension of time to file on Form 8809. File Form 8809 as soon as you know an extension of time to file is necessary, but not before January 1 of the filing year, and not later than March 2, 2020 (March 31, 2020, if you file Forms 8027 electronically).       Where To File If you file a paper return, mail Form 8027 to: Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Ogden, UT 84201    Form 8027 attachments if filing on paper. If applicable, attach a copy of your timely filed Form 8809, and a copy of your ""lower rate"" determination letter from the IRS. If you filed Form 8508, Request for Waiver From Filing Information Returns Electronically, attach a copy of the approved waiver that you received. Don't attach any other documents.     Reporting and filing electronically. If you're required to file 250 or more Forms 8027, you must file the returns electronically. See Pub. 1239 for information on filing Form 8027 electronically. We encourage you to file electronically even if you're not required to file 250 or more Forms 8027.     Penalties The law provides for a penalty if you don't file Form 8027 (and Form 8027-T, if applicable) on time unless you can show reasonable cause for the delay. In addition, if you don't complete an accurate Form 8027, you won't be able to correctly prepare Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, for each directly tipped employee for whom a tip allocation was required to be made. You may be charged penalties for each failure to:    Timely file a correct information return (Forms 8027 and W-2), including failure to file electronically if required; and   Timely furnish a correct Form W-2 to the employee.      For more information on penalties for untimely or incorrect Forms W-2 or 8027, see the penalties sections in the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3, and the General Instructions for Certain Information Returns.     Gross Receipts On Form 8027, you must report your establishment’s gross receipts from food and beverages you provide. You will use gross receipts to determine other amounts that you must report. Gross receipts include all receipts from the provision of food or beverages (other than nonallocable receipts, as defined later) from cash sales, charge receipts, charges to a hotel room (excluding tips charged to the hotel room if your accounting procedures allow these tips to be separated), and the retail value of complimentary food or beverages served to customers as explained later. Generally, tips aren't included in gross receipts. However, if you reduced your cash sales by the amount of any cash you paid to tipped employees for any charged tips due to them, then include those charged tips in your gross receipts. Don't include state or local taxes in gross receipts. Don't include receipts from the sale of merchandise such as souvenirs, memorabilia, tee shirts, or glassware in gross receipts from food and beverages. If you don't charge separately for providing food and beverages along with other goods or services (such as a package deal for food and lodging), make a good-faith estimate of the gross receipts from the food and beverages. This estimate must reflect the cost to the employer for providing the food and beverages plus a reasonable profit factor.    Remind all directly and indirectly tipped employees to include all charged tips and all cash tips received in the tip amount that they must report to you.  Nonallocable receipts. These are receipts for carryout sales and receipts with a service charge added of 10% or more. Carryout sales are sales of food or beverages for consumption off the premises of the establishment. Room service isn't a carryout sale. Nonallocable receipts generally include all sales on which tipping isn't customary.   Complimentary items. Food or beverages served to customers without charge must be included in gross receipts if (a) tipping for providing them is customary at the establishment, and (b) they are provided in connection with an activity that is engaged in for profit, whose receipts wouldn't be included in the amount on line 5 of Form 8027, and whose receipts aren't nonallocable receipts which have a service charge of 10% or more added. For example, you would have to include in gross receipts the retail value of the complimentary drinks served to customers in a gambling casino because tipping is customary, the gambling casino is an activity engaged in for profit, and the gambling receipts of the casino aren't included in the amount on line 5. However, you wouldn't have to include the retail value of complimentary hors d'oeuvres at your bar or a complimentary dessert served to a regular patron of your restaurant in gross receipts because the receipts of the bar or restaurant would be included in the amount on line 5. You wouldn't have to include the value of a fruit basket placed in a hotel room in gross receipts because, generally, tipping for it isn't customary.      Allocation of Tips You must allocate tips among employees who receive them if the total tips reported to you during any payroll period are less than 8% (or the approved lower rate) of this establishment's gross receipts for that period. The allocation is made to each directly tipped employee performing services for the establishment who has a reporting shortfall for the payroll period. No allocation is made to indirectly tipped employees. Generally, the amount allocated is the difference between the total tips reported by employees and 8% (or the lower rate) of the gross receipts, other than nonallocable receipts. There are three methods you may use to allocate tips. See the instructions for line 7, later, for a description of the three methods.  Lower rate. You (or a majority of the employees) may request a lower rate (but not lower than 2%) by submitting a petition to: Internal Revenue Service National Tip Reporting Compliance 3251 North Evergreen Dr. NE Grand Rapids, MI 49525      Don't mail Form 8027 to this address. See Where To File, earlier. The burden of supplying sufficient information to allow the IRS to estimate with reasonable accuracy the actual tip rate of the establishment rests with the petitioner. Your petition for a lower rate must clearly demonstrate that a rate less than 8% should apply. It must include the following information.    Employer's name, address, and employer identification number (EIN).   Establishment's name, address, and establishment number.   Detailed description of the establishment that would help to determine the tip rate. The description should include the type of restaurant, days and hours of operation, type of service including any self-service, the person (waiter or waitress, cashier, etc.) to whom the customer pays the check, whether the check is paid before or after the meal, and whether alcohol is available.   Past year's information shown on lines 1 through 6 of Form 8027 as well as total carryout sales; total charge sales; percentage of sales for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; average dollar amount of a guest check; service charge, if any, added to the check; and the percentage of sales with a service charge.   Type of clientele.   Copy of a representative menu for each meal.       An employer petition must contain the following statement and be signed by a responsible person who is authorized to make and sign a return, statement, or other document.           ""Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this petition, including accompanying documents, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, the facts presented in support of this petition are true, correct, and complete.""         For an employer petition, you must attach to the petition copies of Form 8027 (if any) filed for the 3 years before your petition. If you're petitioning for more than one establishment or you want to know your appeal rights, see Rev. Proc. 86-21, 1986-1 C.B. 560, for additional information. Also include with your petition a check or money order made payable to ""United States Treasury"" for the amount of the user fee required for determination letters. For the current user fee amount, consult the first revenue procedure of the year (for example, Rev. Proc. 2019-1, 2019-01 I.R.B. 1, available at IRS.gov/irb/2019-01_IRB#RP-2019-01). This revenue procedure is updated annually as the first revenue procedure of the year, but it may be modified or amplified during the year. The user fees are posted in Appendix A of the revenue procedure. Since the taxpayer is requesting a determination letter, the payment for the user fee must be submitted along with the petition for the rate reduction.  A majority of all the directly tipped employees must consent to any petition written by an employee. A ""majority of employees"" means more than half of all directly tipped employees employed by the establishment at the time the petition is filed. Employee groups must follow the procedures in Regulations section 31.6053-3(h); Pub. 531, Reporting Tip Income; and Rev. Proc. 86-21. The IRS will notify you when and for how long the reduced rate is effective.    You must attach a copy of your ""lower rate"" determination letter from the IRS when filing a paper Form 8027. See Pub. 1239 for instructions on submitting a copy of your ""lower rate"" determination letter from the IRS when filing electronically.      Reporting Allocated Tips to Employees Give each employee who has been allocated tips a Form W-2 that shows the allocated amount in box 8. Tip allocations have no effect on withholding income tax, social security tax, or Medicare tax from employees’ wages. Allocated tips aren't subject to withholding and must not be included in boxes 1, 3, 5, and 7 of Form W-2. If you allocate tips among employees by the methods described later under the instructions for line 7, you're not liable to any employee if any amount is improperly allocated. However, if the allocation shown on the employee’s Form W-2 differs from the correct allocation by more than 5%, you must correct that employee’s allocation. You must also review the allocable amount of all other employees in the same establishment to ensure that the error didn't distort any other employee’s share by more than 5%. You must furnish Form W-2 to employees by January 31 of the following year. If employment ends before the end of the year and the employee asks for the Form W-2, a tip allocation isn't required on the early Form W-2. See If you furnished Form W-2 before the end of the year, later.  Correcting allocated tips reported on Form W-2 furnished to an employee in January. If you furnished Form W-2 to an employee in January and later discover an error that requires a correction (as discussed earlier), the method for making a correction depends on whether Form W-2 has been filed with the Social Security Administration (SSA).     If you filed Form W-2 with the SSA. Use the current version of Form W-2c to report the corrected allocation and correct the previously filed Form W-2.     If you furnished Form W-2 to an employee but didn't file it with the SSA. Prepare a new Form W-2 with the correct information and file Copy A with the SSA. Write ""Corrected"" on the employee’s new copies (B, C, and 2), and furnish them to the employee. Don't write ""Corrected"" on Copy A of the Form W-2 that you file with the SSA.   If you furnished Form W-2 before the end of the year. You may include on the early Form W-2 the employee’s actual tip allocation or a good-faith estimate of the allocation. Signify a good-faith estimate by writing “Estimate” next to the allocated amount in box 8 of the Form W-2. If you didn't include an allocation on the early Form W-2 or if the estimated allocation on the early form differs from the actual amount by more than 5%, prepare a new Form W-2 with the correct information, and file Copy A with the SSA. Write ""Corrected"" on the employee’s new copies (B, C, and 2) and furnish them to the employee during January of the next year. Don't write ""Corrected"" on Copy A of the Form W-2 that you file with the SSA.    Don't send Forms W-2 to the IRS. We use the information shown on the Forms W-2 that you file with the SSA.      Difference Between Service Charges and Tips Service charges are treated differently from tips for federal tax purposes. Any portion of a service charge that is distributed to an employee is wages, and you must withhold federal income tax, social security tax, and Medicare tax and include the amount on Form W-2 as wages. Service charges aren't reported as tips on Form 8027. You may be required to report service charges on line 3; see the instructions for line 3, later. To accurately report and pay your taxes, you must correctly identify amounts as either a tip or a service charge. Generally, an amount is a tip if:    The payment is made free from compulsion,         The customer has the unrestricted right to determine the amount (including zero),         The payment isn't the subject of negotiation or dictated by employer policy, and         The customer has the right to determine who receives the payment.    The absence of any of these factors creates a doubt as to whether a payment is a tip and indicates that the payment may be a service charge. For additional information, including examples of both service charges and tips, see Q&A 1 in Rev. Rul. 2012-18, 2012-26 I.R.B. 1032, available at IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18.      Specific Instructions   File a separate Form 8027 for each large food or beverage establishment. Use Form 8027-T when filing more than one paper Form 8027.    Name and Address of Establishment and Employer Identification Number Type or print the name and address of the establishment. They may be different from your mailing address, as in the case of employers who have more than one establishment. Enter the name by which your customers know you (your ""doing business as"" name). For example, enter the name on the front of the building or the name of the restaurant within the casino. The EIN should be the same as the number on the Forms W-2 that you furnish to the employees and the Form 941 that you file to report wages and taxes for employees working for the establishment. However, if you use a CPEO, see Certified professional employer organizations, earlier.    Always be sure the EIN on the form you file exactly matches the EIN that the IRS assigned to your business. Don't use your social security number on forms that ask for an EIN. If one of the following applies to you, check the appropriate box on the left side of the form to tell us which type of return you're filing.    Amended return.   Final return.          Type of Establishment Check the box (check only one box) on the form that best describes the type of food or beverage establishment.    An establishment that serves evening meals only (with or without alcoholic beverages).   An establishment that serves evening and other meals (with or without alcoholic beverages).   An establishment that serves only meals other than evening meals (with or without alcoholic beverages).   An establishment that serves food, if at all, only as an incidental part of the business of serving alcoholic beverages.          Employer's Name and Address Enter the name and address of the entity or individual whose EIN was provided earlier. If mail isn't delivered to your street address, enter your P.O. box number. Enter foreign addresses as follows: city, province or state, and country. Don't abbreviate the name of the country.     Establishment Number Enter a five-digit number to identify the individual establishments that you're reporting under the same EIN. Give each establishment a separate number and complete a separate Form 8027 for each. For example, each establishment could be numbered consecutively, starting with 00001. Once you assign a number to an establishment, always use the same number for that establishment each year. If you close an establishment, don't use the number you assigned to it for another establishment.     Does This Establishment Accept Credit Cards, Debit Cards, or Other Charges? You must check either the ""Yes"" or ""No"" box to indicate whether or not the establishment accepts credit cards, debit cards, or other electronic settlement methods. If the ""Yes"" box is checked, lines 1 and 2 of Form 8027 must be completed, and you must enter on lines 1 and 2 the appropriate amounts shown on the charge receipts. See the instructions for lines 1 and 2, later.     Lines 1 Through 8    Rounding Off to Whole Dollars You may round off cents to whole dollars on your Form 8027. If you do round to whole dollars, you must round all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total.     Line 1. Total Charged Tips for Calendar Year 2019 Enter the total amount of tips that are shown on charge receipts for the year. Don't include service charges. See Difference Between Service Charges and Tips, earlier. If you indicated that your establishment accepts credit cards, debit cards, or other charges but have no amounts to report on line 1, enter zero.     Line 2. Total Charge Receipts Showing Charged Tips Enter the total sales from the provision of food and beverages (other than nonallocable receipts, as defined earlier) from charge receipts that had a charged tip shown. Include credit card charges and other credit arrangements and charges to a hotel room unless your normal accounting practice consistently excludes charges to a hotel room. Don't include any tips or any state or local taxes in the amounts reported. If you indicated that your establishment accepts credit cards, debit cards, or other charges but have no amounts to report on line 2, enter zero.     Line 3. Total Amount of Service Charges of Less Than 10% Paid as Wages to Employees Enter the total amount of service charges of less than 10% that have been added to customers' bills and have been distributed to your employees for the year.     Line 4a. Total Tips Reported by Indirectly Tipped Employees Enter the total amount of tips reported for the year by indirectly tipped employees, such as cooks, bussers, and service bartenders. Indirectly tipped employees generally receive their tips from other tipped employees and not directly from the customer.     Line 4b. Total Tips Reported by Directly Tipped Employees Enter the total amount of tips reported for the year by directly tipped employees, such as bartenders and waitstaff. Directly tipped employees receive tips directly from customers. Treat employees, such as maitre d's, who receive tips directly from customers and indirectly through tip splitting or pooling, as directly tipped employees.     Line 4c. Total Tips Reported Add the amounts on lines 4a and 4b and enter the result on line 4c. This amount can't be a negative amount.              Line 4a   + Line 4b     Line 4c           In figuring the tips you should report for 2019, don't include tips received by employees in December 2018, but not reported until January 2019. However, include tips received by employees in December 2019, but not reported until January 2020.    Line 5. Gross Receipts From Food and Beverages Enter the total gross receipts from the provision of food and beverages for this establishment for the year. See Gross Receipts, earlier, for an explanation of what's included in gross receipts.     Line 6 Enter the result of multiplying line 5 by 8% (0.08) or a lower rate (if the establishment was granted a lower rate by the IRS). If a lower rate was granted, write the rate in the space provided and attach a copy of the IRS determination letter. If you file Form 8027 electronically, see Pub. 1239 for instructions on submitting a copy of the IRS determination letter.    The 8% rate (or lower rate) is used for tip allocation purposes only. Using this rate doesn't mean that directly tipped employees must report only 8%. All directly tipped employees and indirectly tipped employees must report the actual amount of tips they receive. You may allocate tips for the calendar year, annually, by payroll period, or by using any period that results in a reasonable division of a calendar year, including biweekly, semimonthly, quarterly, etc. The method you choose will be effective for the entire calendar year.    If you have allocated tips using other than the calendar year, put an ""X"" on line 6 and enter the amount of allocated tips (if any) from your records on line 7.     Line 7. Allocation of Tips If the amount shown on line 6 is more than the amount of tips reported by your employees on line 4c, you must allocate the excess to those employees. Enter the excess on line 7. This excess amount is reported on each employee's Form W-2 as described earlier in Reporting Allocated Tips to Employees. If you previously filed Forms W-2 for employees that didn't include accurate tip allocations, you may be required to file Forms W-2c. For more information, see Correcting allocated tips reported on Form W-2 furnished to an employee in January, earlier. If the amount on line 4c is more than the amount on line 6, you don't need to make a tip allocation. There are three methods by which you may allocate tips. Check the box on line 7a, 7b, or 7c to show the method used.     Line 7a. Hours-Worked Method Establishments that employ fewer than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees (both tipped and nontipped employees) during a payroll period may use the hours-worked method to allocate tips. You will be considered to have employed fewer than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees during a payroll period if the average number of employee hours worked (both tipped and nontipped employees) per business day during a payroll period is less than 200 hours. To allocate tips by the hours-worked method, follow the steps explained in Line 7b. Gross Receipts Method, later. However, for the fraction in step 3 of the gross receipts method, substitute in the numerator (top number) the number of hours worked by each employee who is tipped directly, and in the denominator (bottom number) the total number of hours worked by all employees who are directly tipped for the payroll period. See Regulations section 31.6053-3(f)(1)(iv) for details. If you use the hours-worked method, be sure to enter on line 7a the average number of employee (both tipped and nontipped) hours worked per business day during the payroll period. If the establishment has more than one payroll period, you must use the payroll period in which the greatest number of workers (both tipped and nontipped) were employed.     Line 7b. Gross Receipts Method If no good-faith agreement (as explained later) applies to the payroll period, you must allocate the difference between total tips reported and 8% of gross receipts using the gross receipts method (or hours-worked method (line 7a)) as follows (see Example for Line 7b. Gross Receipts Method, later).    The instructions that follow assume you have chosen to allocate tips by payroll period. However, as described earlier in the instructions for line 6, you may choose to allocate tips for the calendar year, annually, or by using any period that results in a reasonable division of a calendar year, including biweekly, semimonthly, quarterly, etc.      Multiply the establishment's gross receipts (other than nonallocable receipts) for the payroll period by 8% (0.08) or the approved lower rate.   Subtract from the amount figured in step 1 the total amount of tips reported by employees who were tipped indirectly for the payroll period. This difference is the directly tipped employees' total share of 8% (or the lower rate) of the gross receipts of the establishment. Indirectly tipped employees don't receive tips directly from customers. Examples are bussers, service bartenders, and cooks. Directly tipped employees, such as waitstaff and bartenders, receive tips directly from customers. Employees, such as maitre d's, who receive tips directly from customers and indirectly through tip splitting or pooling, are treated as directly tipped employees.   For each employee who is tipped directly, multiply the result in step 2 by the following fraction: the numerator (top number) is the amount of the establishment's gross receipts attributable to the employee, and the denominator (bottom number) is the gross receipts attributable to all directly tipped employees. The result is each directly tipped employee's share of 8% (or the lower rate) of the gross receipts for the payroll period.   From each directly tipped employee's share of 8% (or the lower rate) of the gross receipts figured in step 3, subtract the tips the employee reported for the payroll period. The result is each directly tipped employee's shortfall (if any) for the period.   From the amount figured in step 1, subtract the total tips reported by both directly and indirectly tipped employees. The result is the amount that has to be allocated among the directly tipped employees who had a shortfall for the payroll period as figured in step 4.   For each directly tipped employee who had a shortfall for the period as figured in step 4, multiply the amount in step 5 by the following fraction: the numerator is the employee's shortfall (figured in step 4), and the denominator is the total shortfall of all directly tipped employees. The result is the amount of allocated tips for each directly tipped employee.          Line 7c. Good-Faith Agreement An allocation can be made under a good-faith agreement. This is a written agreement between you and at least two-thirds of the tipped employees of each occupational category (for example, waitstaff, bussers, and maitre d's) working in the establishment when the agreement is adopted. The agreement must:    Provide for an allocation of the difference between total tips reported and 8% (or the lower rate) of gross receipts among tipped employees that approximates the actual distribution of tip income among the employees;   Be effective the first day of a payroll period that begins after the date the agreement is adopted, but no later than January 1 of the next year;   Be adopted when there are tipped employees in each occupational category who would be affected by the agreement; and   Allow for revocation by a written agreement adopted by at least two-thirds of the tipped employees in occupational categories affected by the agreement when it is revoked. The revocation is effective only at the beginning of a payroll period.      Keep a copy of the good-faith agreement for your records.     Line 8. Total Number of Directly Tipped Employees Enter the total number of directly tipped employees who worked at the establishment during 2019. This is the cumulative total of all directly tipped employees who worked at the establishment at any time during the year. If you have a large turnover of directly tipped employees, this number may be large. Don't use this number to determine if you must file Form 8027. Instead, see the Worksheet for Determining if You Must File Form 8027 for Calendar Year 2019, earlier.     Signature Sign your name and include your title.

Gross Receipts Method A large food or beverage establishment has chosen to make tip allocations using its actual payroll period. It has gross receipts for a payroll period of $100,000 and has tips reported for the payroll period of $6,200. Directly tipped employees reported $5,700, while indirectly tipped employees reported $500.              Directly tipped employees Gross receipts for payroll period Tips reported       A $18,000 $1,080       B 16,000 880       C 23,000 1,810       D 17,000 800       E 12,000 450       F 14,000 680       Totals $100,000 $5,700     1. $100,000 (gross receipts) x 0.08 = $8,000   2. $8,000 − $500 (tips reported by indirectly tipped employees) = $7,500               3. Directly tipped employees Directly tipped employees' share of 8% of the gross (Times) 			Gross receipts ratio Employee's share of 8% of gross     A $7,500 18,000/100,000 = $1,350     B $7,500 16,000/100,000 = 1,200     C $7,500 23,000/100,000 = 1,725     D $7,500 17,000/100,000 = 1,275     E $7,500 12,000/100,000 = 900     F $7,500 14,000/100,000 = 1,050         Total $7,500               4. Directly tipped employees Employee's share of 8% of the gross (Minus) 			Tips reported Employee shortfall     A $1,350 $1,080 = $270     B $1,200 880 = 320     C $1,725 1,810 = –     D $1,275 800 = 475     E $ 900 450 = 450     F $1,050 680 = 370       Total shortfall $1,885   5. $8,000 less $6,200 (total tips reported) = $1,800 (amount allocable among employees who had a shortfall)               6.

For additional examples for the hours-worked method and gross receipts method, see Regulations section 31.6053-3(f).     Employer's Optional Worksheet for Tipped Employees Unreported tip income can lead to additional employer liability for social security tax and Medicare tax. As a means of determining if your employees are reporting all of their tips to you, please take a few minutes to voluntarily complete the following worksheet. Completing this worksheet is only for the employer's information (don't send it to the IRS).             1. Enter amount from Form 8027, line 1 1.     2. Enter amount from Form 8027, line 2 2.     3. Divide line 1 by line 2, enter as a decimal (at least 4 decimal places) 3.     4. Enter amount from Form 8027, line 4c 4.     5. Enter amount from Form 8027, line 5 5.     6. Divide line 4 by line 5, enter as a decimal (at least 4 decimal places) 6.     7. Subtract line 6 from line 3; if zero or less, stop here 7.     8. Potential unreported tips. Multiply line 7 by line 5 8.          Once you have completed the worksheet:      If the entry on line 7 is zero or less, your employees are probably accurately reporting their tips; however,   If the entry on line 8 is greater than zero, depending on the type of operation you have, it is possible that your employees aren't reporting all of their tip income to you.         Another quick method to determine if your employees are properly reporting all of their tips to you is to compare the rate of tips reported on credit sales to the rate of tips reported on cash sales. For example, if line 3 in the worksheet greatly exceeds the rate determined from dividing reported cash tips by reportable cash receipts (that is, total cash receipts less nonallocable cash receipts), some of your employees may not be reporting all of their tips to you and you generally should be showing an amount on line 7 (""Allocation of tips"") of Form 8027.     Need Help? If it appears that not all tips are being reported to you, the IRS offers a service called the Tip Rate Determination & Education Program. This program can assist you, the employer, in implementing more effective methods of tip income reporting. The program also offers assistance in educating tipped employees concerning their obligations relating to the reporting of any tip income they receive. To find out more about this program or to participate in a voluntary tip compliance agreement, see Pub. 3144. You may also send an email to TIP.Program@irs.gov and request information on this program. An information reporting customer service section is available to answer questions about reporting on Forms 8027, W-2, W-3, 1099, and other information returns. If you have questions about reporting on information returns, call:    866-455-7438 (toll free),         304-263-8700 (toll call), or         304-579-4827 (TDD/TTY for persons who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability).      You can also reach the center by email at mccirp@irs.gov.

240,Instructions for Form 8615 (2019),"   Instructions for Form 8615 (2019)  Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income (Rev. January 2020)    Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    2019        Instructions for Form 8615 - Introductory Material          Future Developments    For the latest information about developments related to Form 8615 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/Form8615.     What’s New  Election to modify the tax on your unearned income. Recent legislation has modified for 2019 (and retroactively for 2018) the rules related to the tax for certain children who have unearned income to allow you to elect to calculate your tax based on the tax rate of your parent. For tax year 2019, you can elect this alternative application for the tax on your unearned income. You will complete Form 8615 differently depending on your election. See the instructions for Part II Tax, later, for more information. If you make this election for 2019, include a statement with your return specifying ""election to modify tax of unearned income."" The statement can be made on the return (for example, on line 7 or at the top of Form 8615) or on an attachment filed with the return.  For tax year 2018, if you choose to modify the tax on your unearned income using the tentative tax based on the tax rate of your parent, you will need to use the 2018 Instructions for Form 8615 and file an amended return, Form 1040-X. See IRS.gov/Form1040X for more information about amending a tax return. If you make this election, include a statement or an attachment with your amended return specifying ""election to modify tax of unearned income.""       Reminder  Change in tax rates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 modified the tax rates and brackets used to figure the tax on 2019 unearned income for certain children. Unless you elect to calculate your tax based on the tax rate of your parent, all net unearned income over a threshold amount of $2,200 for 2019 will be taxed using the brackets and rates for estates and trusts.        General Instructions      Purpose of Form Use Form 8615 to figure your tax on unearned income over $2,200 if you are under age 18, and in certain situations if you are older. See Who Must File, later.     Unearned Income For Form 8615, ""unearned income"" includes all taxable income other than earned income. Unearned income includes taxable interest, ordinary dividends, capital gains (including capital gain distributions), rents, royalties, etc. It also includes taxable social security benefits, pension and annuity income, taxable scholarship and fellowship grants not reported on Form W-2, unemployment compensation, alimony, and income (other than earned income) received as the beneficiary of a trust.     Who Must File Form 8615 must be filed for anyone who meets all of the following conditions.    You had more than $2,200 of unearned income.   You are required to file a tax return.   You were either:    Under age 18 at the end of 2019,   Age 18 at the end of 2019 and didn’t have earned income that was more than half of your support, or   A full-time student at least age 19 and under age 24 at the end of 2019 and didn’t have earned income that was more than half of your support.    (Earned income is defined later. Support is defined below.)   At least one of your parents was alive at the end of 2019.   You don’t file a joint return for 2019.      These rules apply if you’re legally adopted or a stepchild. These rules also apply whether or not you’re a dependent. These rules don’t apply if neither of your parents were living at the end of the year.  Support. Your support includes all amounts spent to provide you with food, lodging, clothing, education, medical and dental care, recreation, transportation, and similar necessities. To figure your support, count support provided by you, your parents, and others. However, a scholarship you received isn’t considered support if you’re a full-time student. For details, see Pub. 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information.    Certain January 1 birthdays. Use the following chart to determine whether you meet condition 3 under Who Must File, earlier, for certain January 1 birthdays.         IF you were born on... THEN, at the end of 2019, you are considered to be...     January 1, 2002 18*   January 1, 2001 19**   January 1, 1996 24***   *You aren’t under age 18. You meet condition 3 only if you didn’t have earned income that was more than half of your support. 			**You meet condition 3 only if you were a full-time student who didn’t have earned income that was more than half of your support. 			***Don’t use Form 8615.           Your parent may be able to elect to report your interest, ordinary dividends, and capital gain distributions on his or her return. If your parent makes this election, you won’t have to file a return or Form 8615. However, the federal income tax on your income, including qualified dividends and capital gain distributions, may be higher if this election is made. For more details, see Form 8814, Parents’ Election To Report Child's Interest and Dividends.    Additional Information For more details, see Pub. 929, Tax Rules for Children and Dependents.     Incomplete Information for Filing If your or your parent's taxable income, filing status, or net unearned income isn't known by the due date of your return, reasonable estimates can be used. When the correct information is available, file Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Instead of using estimates, you can get an automatic 6-month extension of time to file. For details, see Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.     An extension of time to file isn’t an extension of time to pay.    Amended Return If your or your parent’s income changes after your return is filed, the tax must be refigured using the adjusted amounts. If your tax changes, file Form 1040-X to correct your tax. You must also file an amended return if you elect to modify the tax on your unearned income for tax year 2018 using the tentative tax based on the tax rate of your parent. See What's New.     Alternative Minimum Tax If your tax is figured on Form 8615, you may owe the alternative minimum tax. For details, see Form 6251, Alternative Minimum Tax—Individuals, and its instructions.     Net Investment Income Tax If your tax is figured on Form 8615, you may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). NIIT is a 3.8% tax on the lesser of net investment income or the excess of your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over the threshold amount. UseForm 8960, Net Investment Income Tax, to figure this tax. For more information on NIIT, go to IRS.gov/NIIT.      Specific Instructions      Lines A and B If your parents were married to each other and filed a joint return, enter the name and social security number (SSN) of your parent who is listed first on the joint return. If your parents were married but filed separate returns, enter the name and SSN of your parent who had the higher taxable income. If you don’t know which parent had the higher taxable income, see Pub. 929. If your parents were unmarried, treated as unmarried for federal income tax purposes, or separated by either a divorce or separate maintenance decree, enter the name and SSN of the parent with whom you resided for the greater part of the calendar year. See the definition of custodial parent in Pub. 501.  Exceptions. If your custodial parent remarried and filed a joint return with his or her new spouse, enter the name and SSN of the person listed first on the joint return, even if that person isn’t your parent. If your custodial parent and his or her new spouse filed separate returns, enter the name and SSN of the person with the higher taxable income, even if that person isn’t your parent. If your parents were unmarried but lived together during the year with you, enter the name and SSN of the parent who had the higher taxable income.      Line 1 If you had no earned income (defined below), enter your adjusted gross income from Form 1040, line 8b, or Form 1040-NR, line 35. If you had earned income, use the Unearned Income Worksheet to figure the amount to enter on line 1. But use Pub. 929 instead of the worksheet to figure the amount to enter on line 1 if you:    File Form 2555 (relating to foreign earned income),   Have a net loss from self-employment, or   Claim a net operating loss deduction.       Earned income. Earned income includes wages, tips, and other payments received for personal services performed.  If you’re a sole proprietor or a partner in a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors, earned income also includes a reasonable allowance for compensation for personal services, but not more than 30% of your share of the net profits from that trade or business (after subtracting the deduction for one-half of self-employment tax). However, the 30% limit doesn’t apply if there are no net profits from the trade or business.  If capital isn’t an income-producing factor and your personal services produced the business income, all of your gross income from the trade or business is considered earned income.

A tax-exempt entity is a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction if it:     Facilitates the transaction by reason of its tax-exempt, tax indifferent, or tax-favored status;    Is identified in published guidance, by type, class, or role, as a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction. See example in Regulations section 53.4965-4(c).        Prohibited tax shelter transaction. Generally, a prohibited tax shelter transaction is a transaction that is a listed transaction (including subsequently listed transaction), a confidential transaction, or a transaction with contractual protection. See definitions of these terms on pages 1 and 2.   Note. In general, if the IRS determines by published guidance that a transaction will be excluded from the definition of listed transaction, confidential transaction, or transaction with contractual protection, the transaction will not be considered a prohibited tax shelter transaction.      Listed transaction. A listed transaction is a transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to any of the types of transactions that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and are identified by notice, regulation, or other form of published guidance as a listed transaction. For existing guidance, see Notice 2009-59, 2009-31 I.R.B. 170 and IRS.gov/Businesses/Corporations/Listed-Transactions.      Subsequently listed transaction. A subsequently listed transaction is a transaction that is identified in published guidance as a listed transaction after the tax-exempt entity has entered into the transaction and that was not a confidential transaction or transaction with contractual protection at the time the entity entered into the transaction. See section 4965(e)(2) for more information.     Substantially similar. A transaction is substantially similar to another transaction if it is expected to obtain the same or similar types of tax consequences and is either factually similar or based on the same or similar tax strategy. Receipt of an opinion regarding the tax consequences of the transaction is not relevant to the determination of whether the transaction is the same as or substantially similar to another transaction. Further, the term substantially similar must be broadly construed in favor of disclosure. See Regulations section 1.6011-4(c)(4) for examples.   Confidential transaction. A confidential transaction is a transaction that is offered under conditions of confidentiality and for which a minimum fee (defined below) was paid to an advisor. A transaction is considered to be offered under conditions of confidentiality if the advisor places a limitation on disclosure of the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction and the limitation on disclosure protects the confidentiality of the advisor's tax strategies. The transaction is treated as confidential even if the conditions of confidentiality are not legally binding on the taxpayer. See Regulations section 1.6011-4(b)(3) for more information.     Minimum fee. For a corporation, or a partnership or trust in which all of the owners or beneficiaries are corporations (looking through any partners or beneficiaries that are themselves partners or trusts), the minimum fee is $250,000. For all others, the minimum fee is $50,000. The minimum fee includes all fees paid directly or indirectly for the tax strategy, advice or analysis of the transaction (whether or not related to the tax consequences of the transaction), implementation and documentation of the transaction, and tax preparation fees to the extent they exceed customary return preparation fees. Fees do not include amounts paid to a person, including an advisor, in that person's capacity as a party to the transaction.     Transaction with contractual protection. A transaction with contractual protection is a transaction for which a participant (or related party as defined under section 267(b) or 707(b)) has the right to a full refund or partial refund of fees if all or part of the intended tax consequences from the transaction are not sustained. It also includes a transaction for which fees are contingent on the realization of tax benefits from the transaction. For exceptions and other details, see Regulations section 1.6011-4(b)(4) and Rev. Proc. 2007-20.    Entity manager. In the case of a plan entity, entity manager means the person who approves or otherwise causes the tax-exempt entity to be a party to the prohibited tax shelter transaction. See section 4965(d)(2).       Recordkeeping The entity or entity manager must keep a copy of all documents and other records related to a prohibited tax shelter transaction. See Regulations section 1.6001-1(c) and 53.6001-1 for more details.     When To File  General rules. Generally, the due date for filing Form 8886-T depends on whether the tax-exempt entity is a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction to reduce its own federal tax liability or, alternatively, whether it is a party to such a transaction to facilitate the transaction by reason of its tax-exempt, tax indifferent, or tax-favored status. In the case of a tax-exempt entity that is a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction because it facilitates the transaction by reason of its tax-exempt, tax indifferent, or tax-favored status, Form 8886-T must be filed on or before May 15 of the calendar year following the close of the calendar year during which the tax-exempt entity entered into the prohibited tax shelter transaction. See section 1.6033-5(d)(1).    Entities identified as a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction by published guidance. In the case of a tax-exempt entity that becomes a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction because it is identified in published guidance by type, class, or roles as a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction, the published guidance will specify the due date of Form 8886-T.    Subsequently listed transaction. In the case of a tax-exempt entity that is a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction because the transaction was subsequently listed, Form 8886-T must be filed by May 15 of the calendar year following the close of the calendar year during which the transaction was identified as a listed transaction. See section 1.6033-5(d)(2).      Where To File Send the return to the: Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Center Ogden, UT 84201-0027       Penalties There is a monetary penalty under section 6652(c) for the failure to disclose information required under section 6033(a)(2) with respect to a prohibited tax shelter transaction. The penalty for failure to include information with respect to a prohibited tax shelter transaction is $105 for each day during which such failure continues, not to exceed $54,000 for each required disclosure. In addition, the IRS is authorized to make a written demand on the entity or entity manager specifying a future date by which the required disclosure must be filed.

In the case of a non-plan entity (defined on page 1), the penalty is imposed on the tax-exempt entity. In the case of a plan entity (defined on page 1), the penalty is imposed on the entity manager. These penalties are adjusted for inflation. See section 6652(c) for more information on penalties.

The term ""plan sponsor"" means:   The employer, for a group health plan established or maintained by a single employer; The employee organization, in the case of a plan of an employee organization; or The association, committee, joint board of trustees, or other similar group of representatives of the parties who establish or maintain the plan, if the group health plan is established or maintained jointly by one or more employers and one or more employee organizations, or by two or more employers.    Include the suite, room, or other unit numbers after the street number. If the post office does not deliver mail to the street address and you have a P.O. box, show the box number instead of the street address. If the plan sponsor has a foreign address, enter the information in the following order: city or town, state or province, and country. Follow the country's practice for entering the postal code. Do not abbreviate the country name.    Item E. Plan sponsor's EIN.  Enter the nine-digit employer identification number (EIN) assigned to the plan sponsor. This should be the same number used to file the Form 5500 series return/report.    Item F. Plan year ending.               ""Plan year"" is defined in Regulations section 54.9801-2. Enter eight digits in month/date/year order. This number assists the IRS in properly identifying the plan and time period for which the Form 8928 is being filed. For example, a plan year ended March 31, 2016, should be shown as 03/31/2016.    Item G. Plan number.  Enter the three-digit number that the employer or plan administrator assigned to the plan. This three-digit number is used with the EIN entered on line B and is used by the IRS, the Department of Labor, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as a unique 12-digit number to identify the plan.    If the plan number is not provided, this will cause a delay in processing your return.    Filer's signature.  To reduce the possibility of correspondence and penalties, please sign and date the form. Also enter a daytime phone number where you can be reached.    Paid Preparer Use Only.  A paid preparer must sign Form 8928 and provide the  information in the Paid Preparer Use Only section at the end of the form if the preparer was paid to prepare the form and is not an employee of the filing entity. The preparer must give you a copy of the form in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS. If you are a paid preparer, enter your Preparer Tax  Identification Number (PTIN) in the space provided. Include your complete address. If you work for a firm, you also must enter the firm’s name and the EIN of the firm. However, you cannot use the PTIN of the tax preparation firm in place of your PTIN.

For more information about  applying for a PTIN online, visit the IRS website at  www.irs.gov/ptin.      Part I. Tax on Failure To Satisfy Continuation Coverage Requirements Under Section 4980B Complete a separate Part I, Section A, lines 1 through 6, for each qualifying event for which one or more failures to satisfy continuation coverage requirements occurred during the reporting period as a result of failures due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. If multiple qualifying events occurred with different noncompliance periods, complete lines 1 through 6 on a separate Part I for each qualifying event. Then complete a ""summary"" Form 8928 with items A through G and enter the total amount of the excise tax on line 7 of that summary form and complete lines 8 through 11 for all qualifying events as a result of failures due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.  Complete a separate Part I, lines 12 through 14, for each qualifying event for which one or more failures to satisfy continuation coverage requirements occurred during the reporting period as a result of failures due to willful neglect or otherwise not due to reasonable cause. If multiple qualifying events occurred with different noncompliance periods, complete lines 12 through 14 on a separate Part I for each qualifying event. Then complete a ""summary"" Form 8928 with items A through G and enter the total amount of the excise tax on line 15 of that summary form for all failures that were due to willful neglect or otherwise not due to reasonable cause. Write ""Summary Form"" at the top to indicate that this is a summary form and attach all copies to it.    You may report all failures on the same form if the failures occurred during the same tax year. For purposes of Part I, a qualifying event is any of the following.  Death of the covered employee. Termination or reduction of hours of the covered employee's employment (other than for employee gross misconduct). Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee from the employee's spouse. Covered employee becoming entitled to Medicare benefits. Dependent child of the covered employee ceasing to be a covered child under the terms of the plan. Bankruptcy of the employer from whose employment the covered employee retired.     Waiver of excise tax.  The Secretary may waive part or all of the excise tax under Part I, to the extent that payment of the tax would be excessive relative to the failure involved. This only applies to failures due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.     Note. The tax under Part I will not apply to the following.  Any failure of a group health plan if the qualifying event occurred during the calendar year immediately following a calendar year during which all employers maintaining the plan normally employed fewer than 20 employees on a typical business day. Any governmental plan under section 414(d). Any church plan under section 414(e).        Section A. Failures Due to Reasonable Cause and Not to Willful Neglect If the failure or failures as a result of a particular qualifying event were due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, complete Part I, Section A, lines 1 through 11.  Line 1.  Calculate the total number of days of noncompliance within the reporting period beginning on the date the failure first occurred and ending on the earlier of the date the failure is corrected or, at the latest, a date that is 6 months after the last day of the maximum continuation coverage period under the qualifying event that led to the failure.    The noncompliance period may include portions of more than 1 plan year (in the case of an employee benefit plan) or 1 tax year (in the case of an employer or third-party administrator). In that case, only the portion of the noncompliance period falling within that plan year or tax year would be used to calculate the excise tax due for that year.    Line 4.  No tax is due for any failure under Part I, Section A, if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that no one liable for the tax knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that the failure occurred. Additionally, no tax is due if the failure under Part I, Section A, was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and the failure was corrected during the 30-day period beginning on the 1st date anyone liable for the tax knew, or exercising reasonable diligence should have known, that the failure existed. For this purpose, a failure is treated as corrected if the failure is retroactively undone to the extent possible and the qualified beneficiary to whom the failure relates is placed in a financial position which is as good as such beneficiary would have been in had the failure not occurred.    Line 5.  The minimum excise tax under Part I, Section A, is $2,500 for each qualified beneficiary for whom one or more failures occurred if the failure or failures were not corrected before the date a notice of examination of income tax liability was sent from the IRS and the failure or failures continued during the examination period. The minimum excise tax under Part I, Section A, is $15,000 if the failure or failures are determined to be more than de minimis.    Line 7.  If you had more than one qualifying event during the reporting period, complete lines 1 through 6 in a separate Part I, Section A, for each qualifying event and enter the total from line 6 from all copies of Part I, Section A, on line 7 of your summary form. See the discussion under Part I earlier.    Line 8.  For a single employer plan, enter on line 8 the aggregate amount paid or incurred during the preceding tax year by the employer (or a predecessor) for its group health plan. For a multiemployer plan, enter on this line the amount paid or incurred during the current tax year to provide medical care, directly or through insurance or reimbursement.    Line 11.  The maximum excise tax payable during a tax year by third-party administrators, HMOs, and insurance companies under Part I, Section A, is $2 million for all plans for failures due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. For those entities, do not enter more than $2 million on this line for such failures for all plans even if the aggregate excise tax owed for all failures under Part I, Section A, is more than $2 million.       Section B. Failures Due to Willful Neglect or Otherwise Not Due to Reasonable Cause If the failure or failures as a result of a particular qualifying event were due to willful neglect or otherwise not due to reasonable cause, complete Part I, Section B, lines 12 through 15.  Line 12.  Calculate the total number of days of noncompliance within the reporting period beginning on the date the failure first occurred and ending on the earlier of the date the failure is corrected or, at the latest, a date that is 6 months after the last day of the maximum continuation coverage period under the qualifying event that led to the failure.    Line 15.  If you had more than one qualifying event during the reporting period, complete lines 12 through 14 in a separate Part I, Section B, for each qualifying event and enter the total from line 14 from all copies of Part I, Section B, on line 15 of your summary form. See the discussion under Part I earlier.        Part II. Tax on Failure To Meet Portability, Access, and Renewability Requirements Under Section 4980D Complete a separate Part II, Section A, lines 17 through 23, for each failure to meet portability, access, and renewability requirements that occurred during the reporting period that was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. If multiple such failures occurred with different noncompliance periods, complete lines 17 through 23 in a separate Part I, Section A, for each failure. Then complete a ""summary"" Form 8928 with items A through G and enter the total amount of the excise tax on line 24 of that summary form and complete lines 25 through 28 for all failures due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.  Complete a separate Part II, Section B, lines 29 through 33, for each failure to meet portability, access, and renewability requirements that occurred during the reporting period that was due to willful neglect or otherwise not due to reasonable cause. If multiple failures occurred with different noncompliance periods, complete lines 29 through 32 on a separate Part II, Section B, for each failure. Then complete a ""summary"" Form 8928 with items A through G and enter the total amount of the excise tax on line 33 of that summary form for all such failures. Write ""Summary Form"" at the top to indicate that this is a summary form and attach all copies to it.  Waiver of excise tax.  The Secretary may waive part or all of the excise tax under Part II, to the extent that payment of the tax would be excessive relative to the failure involved. This only applies to failures due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.    Exception for certain insured small employer plans.  If you are a small employer who provides health insurance coverage solely through a contract with a health insurance issuer, you will not be liable for the excise tax under Part II for any failure (other than a failure under section 9811) that is solely the result of the health insurance coverage offered by the issuer.                 ""Small employer"" is generally defined as an employer who employed an average of at least 2 but not more than 50 employees on business days during the preceding calendar year, and who employs at least 2 employees on the first day of the current plan year. Special rules apply to employers not in existence in the preceding year. See section 4980D(d)(2)(B).      Section A. Failures Due to Reasonable Cause and Not to Willful Neglect If the failure or failures were due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, complete Part II, Section A, lines 17 through 28.  Line 17.  Calculate the total number of days of noncompliance within the reporting period beginning on the date the failure first occurred and ending on the date the failure is corrected.    The noncompliance period may include portions of more than 1 plan year (in the case of an employee benefit plan) or 1 tax year (in the case of an employer or third-party administrator). In that case, only the portion of the noncompliance period falling within that plan year or tax year would be used to calculate the excise tax due for that year.    Line 21.  No tax is due for any failure under Part II, Section A, if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that no one liable for the tax knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that the failure occurred. Additionally, no tax is due if the failure under Part II, Section A, was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and the failure was corrected during the 30-day period beginning on the first date anyone liable for the tax knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that the failure existed. For this purpose, a failure is treated as corrected if the failure is retroactively undone to the extent possible and the person to whom the failure relates is placed in a financial position which is as good as such person would have been in had the failure not occurred. In the case of a church plan, the failure must be corrected before the close of the correction period, as defined under section 414(e)(4)(C).    Line 22.  The minimum excise tax under Part II, Section A, is $2,500 for each qualified beneficiary for whom one or more failures occurred if the failure or failures were not corrected before the date a notice of examination of income tax liability was sent from the IRS and the failure or failures continued during the examination period. The minimum excise tax under Part II, Section A, is $15,000 if the failure or failures are determined to be more than de minimis.    Exception for church plans. The $2,500 (or $15,000, if applicable) minimum excise tax does not apply to a church plan, as defined in section 414(e). If your plan meets the requirements for a church plan, enter ""-0-"" on this line and go to line 23.     Line 24.  If you had more than one failure during the reporting period, complete lines 17 through 23 in a separate Part II, Section A, for each failure and enter the total from line 23 from all copies of Part II, Section A, on line 24 of your summary form. See the discussion under Part I earlier.    Line 25.  For a single employer plan, enter on this line the aggregate amount paid or incurred during the preceding tax year by the employer (or a predecessor) for its group health plan. For a multiemployer plan, enter on this line the amount paid or incurred during the current tax year to provide medical care, directly or through insurance or reimbursement.       Section B. Failure Due to Willful Neglect or Otherwise Not Due to Reasonable Cause If the failure or failures were due to willful neglect or otherwise not due to reasonable cause, complete Part II, Section B, lines 29 through 33.  Line 29.  Calculate the total number of days of noncompliance within the reporting period beginning on the date the failure first occurred and ending on the date the failure is corrected.    Line 33.  If you had more than one failure during the reporting period, complete lines 29 through 32 in a separate Part II, Section B, for each qualifying event and enter the total from line 32 from all copies of Part II, Section B, on line 33 of your summary form. See the discussion under Part I earlier.        Part III. Tax on Failure To Make Comparable Archer MSA Contributions Under Section 4980E An employer is liable for tax under section 4980E if he fails to make comparable contributions to the Archer MSAs of all comparable participating employees for each coverage period during the calendar year.              ""Comparable contributions"" are contributions which are the same amount or which are the same percentage of the annual deductible limit under the high deductible health plan covering the employees.              ""Comparable participating employees"" are employees who are eligible individuals covered under any high deductible health plan of the employer, and who have the same category of coverage. To determine whether contributions are comparable, see Regulations sections 54.4980G-1 through 54.4980G-7.  Line 35.  Enter the aggregate amount contributed to employees' Archer MSAs for tax years ending with or within the calendar year.    Waiver of excise tax.  The Secretary may waive part or all of the excise tax under this part, to the extent that payment of the tax would be excessive relative to the failure involved. This only applies to failures due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.    Controlled group.  For purposes of this part, all persons treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) will be treated as one employer.       Part IV. Tax on Failure To Make Comparable HSA Contributions Under Section 4980G An employer is liable for tax under section 4980G if he fails to make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees for each coverage period during the calendar year.  Line 37.  Enter the aggregate amount contributed to employees' HSAs for tax years ending with or within the calendar year.    Waiver of excise tax.  The Secretary may waive part or all of the excise tax under this part, to the extent that payment of the tax would be excessive relative to the failure involved. This only applies to failures due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.    Controlled group.  For purposes of this part, all persons treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) will be treated as one employer.       Part V.

January 2016))  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 09/2016      Instructions for Form 8971 and Schedule A - Introductory Material Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.    Future Developments For the latest information about developments related to Form 8971 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to www.irs.gov/form8971.    General Instructions    Purpose of Form The Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015 requires executors of an estate and other persons who are required to file Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return or Form 706-NA, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return Estate of nonresident not a citizen of the United States, to report the final estate tax value of property distributed or to be distributed from the estate, if the estate tax return is filed after July 2015.  Form 8971, along with a copy of every Schedule A, is used to report values to the IRS. One Schedule A is provided to each beneficiary receiving property from an estate.    Provide each beneficiary only with a copy of that beneficiary’s own Schedule A. Do not provide a copy of the Form 8971 with or without attached Schedule(s) A to any beneficiary. Certain property received by a beneficiary may be subject to a consistency requirement, meaning that the beneficiary can’t use a value higher than the value reported on Schedule A as the beneficiary’s initial basis in the property.     Who Must File An executor of an estate or other person(s) required to file Form 706 or Form 706-NA under sections 6018(a) and 6018(b), if the return is filed after July 2015, and whether or not that form is filed timely, is required to file Form 8971 with attached Schedule(s) A with the IRS and to provide each beneficiary listed on the Form 8971 with that beneficiary’s Schedule A.  See the Instructions for Form 706 or Form 706-NA, for more information on the filing requirement for those forms. Form 8971 isn’t required when:  The gross estate plus adjusted taxable gifts is less than the basic exclusion amount;  Estate tax-related forms (for example, Forms 706-QDT, 706-CE, and 706-GS(D), other than those mentioned above are filed;  The estate tax return is filed solely to make an allocation or election respecting the generation-skipping transfer tax; or The estate tax return is filed solely to elect portability of the deceased spousal exclusion amount (DSUE).        When To File Form 8971 (including all attached Schedule(s) A) must be filed with the IRS and only the Schedule A is to be provided to the beneficiary listed on that Schedule A, no later than the earlier of:  The date that is 30 days after the date on which Form 706 or Form 706-NA is required to be filed (including extensions) with the IRS; or  The date that is 30 days after the date Form 706 or Form 706-NA is filed with the IRS.    If the first Form 706 or Form 706-NA is filed both after the form’s due date (including extensions) and after July 2015, the Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A are due 30 days after the filing date.  Form 8971 is a separate filing requirement from the estate’s Form 706 or 706-NA, and shouldn't be attached to the respective estate tax return.  Form 8971 and attached Schedule(s) A must be filed with the IRS, separate from any and all other tax returns filed by the estate.   Note. Notice 2016-27, 2016-15 I.R.B. 576, available at www.irs.gov/irb/2016-15_IRB/index.html, made June 30, 2016, the due date for:    All Forms 8971 (including the attached Schedule(s) A) required to be filed with the IRS after July 31, 2015, and before June 30, 2016; and   All Schedules A required to be provided to beneficiaries after July 31, 2015, and before June 30, 2016.      If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the executor of an estate or other person(s) may file on the next business day.         Where To File File Form 8971 (including all Schedule(s) A) at the following address. Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Center Mail Stop #824G Cincinnati, OH  45999   A beneficiary can be provided Schedule A:  In person to an individual beneficiary, to the trustee(s) of a beneficiary trust, or to the executor(s) of a beneficiary estate; By email; By U.S. mail to the beneficiary’s last known address; or By private delivery service to the beneficiary’s last known address (see below).    The executor of the estate (or other person required to file) must certify on Form 8971, Part II, column D, the date on which Schedule A was provided to each beneficiary and should keep proof of mailing, proof of delivery, acknowledgment of receipt, or other information relevant for the estate’s records.  In cases where a trust or another estate is a beneficiary and has multiple trustees or executors, providing Schedule A to one trustee or executor is enough to meet the requirement.   Private delivery services.  Certain private delivery services designated by the IRS may be used to meet the “timely mailing as timely filing” rule for tax returns.  These private delivery services include only the following.  DHL Express 9:00, DHL Express 10:30, DHL Express 12:00, DHL Express Worldwide, DHL Express Envelope, DHL Import Express 10:30, DHL Import Express 12:00, and DHL Import Express Worldwide. Federal Express (FedEx): FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx Standard Overnight, FedEx 2Day, FedEx International Priority, FedEx International First, FedEx First Overnight, FedEx International Next Flight Out, and FedEx International Economy. United Parcel Service (UPS): UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air A.M., UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Express, and UPS Next Day Air Early AM.    For the IRS mailing address to use if you are using a private delivery service, go to IRS.gov and enter “private delivery service” in the search box. The private delivery service can tell you how to get written proof of the mailing date.       Supplemental Forms 8971 and Schedules A The value of the property to be reported on the initial Form 8971 and the attached Schedules A is the fair market value of the asset as reported on the estate tax return.  However, the final value for purposes of the federal estate tax may differ from that reported on the estate tax return.  A value is considered “final” when:  The value of the property shown on an estate tax return filed with the IRS isn't contested by the IRS before the period of assessment expires; The value of the property is specified by the IRS and isn't timely contested by the estate (or other person required to file under section 6018(b)); or The value of the property is determined by a court or pursuant to a settlement agreement with the IRS, including the resolution of a claim for abatement or refund.    If information reported on Form 8971 and the Schedule(s) A filed with the IRS or provided to a beneficiary differs from the final value (as the result of the resolution of a valuation dispute or otherwise), the executor or other person required to make this filing must file a supplemental Form 8971 and affected Schedule(s) A with the IRS and provide an updated supplemental Schedule A to each affected beneficiary no later than 30 days after the adjustment.  See Where To File, earlier. On both the supplemental Form 8971 and each supplemental Schedule A, the “Supplemental Filing” box should be checked and only the information that has changed should be reported. If the initial Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A identify several beneficiaries who might receive the same  property, the estate may, but isn’t required to, file a supplemental Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A to specify the actual distribution of that property among the identified beneficiaries. If the executor or other person required to file Form 8971 has been notified that a Form 706 or Form 706-NA, related to the Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A has been selected for examination, a copy of the supplemental Form 8971 with attached supplemental Schedule(s) A should be provided to the office conducting the examination.     Rounding Off to Whole Dollars The value of property should be reported in U.S. dollars and rounded to whole-dollar amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.55 becomes $3. If you add two or more amounts to figure an item's value, include the cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total.     Penalties   Note. An executor may be subject to penalties for failure to file and/or furnish correct Forms 8971 and Schedule(s) A even if there was no tax due on the estate tax return.   Failure to file correct Forms 8971 by the due date (section 6721).  If the executor of an estate or other person required to file Form 8971 fails to file a correct Form 8971 and/or Schedule A with the IRS by the due date and reasonable cause isn't shown, a penalty may be imposed. The penalty applies if there is a failure to file timely, a failure to include all information required to be shown on the form or schedule, a failure to include correct information on the form or schedule, or a failure to file a correct supplemental Form 8971 and/or Schedule A by the due date.  A complete Form 8971 includes all Schedule(s) A.  Only one penalty will apply for all failures relating to a single filing of a single Form 8971 and the Schedule(s) A required to be filed along with it.  Each filing of a Form 8971 with Schedule(s) A is a separate filing, regardless as to whether the filing is of the initial Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A or a supplemental Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A. The amount of the penalty depends on when the correct Form 8971 with Schedule(s) A is filed. The penalty is as follows.  $50 per Form 8971 (including all Schedule(s) A) if it is filed within 30 days after the due date. The maximum penalty is $532,000 per year (or $186,000 if the taxpayer qualifies for lower maximum penalties, as described below). $260 per Form 8971 (including all Schedule(s) A) if it is filed more than 30 days after the due date or if it isn't filed. The maximum penalty is $3,193,000 per year ($1,064,000 if the taxpayer qualifies for lower maximum penalties, as described below).    All penalty amounts shown are subject to adjustment for inflation.    Lower maximum penalties.  You qualify for lower maximum penalties if your average annual gross receipts for the 3 most recent tax years (or for the period you were in existence, if shorter) ending before the calendar year in which the information returns were due are $5 million or less.     Intentional disregard of filing requirements.  If any failure to file a correct Form 8971 or Schedule A is due to intentional disregard of the requirements to file a correct Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A, the minimum penalty is at least $530 per Form 8971 and the Schedule(s) A required to be filed with it, with no maximum penalty.    Inconsequential error or omission.  An inconsequential error or omission isn't considered a failure to include correct information.  An inconsequential error or omission doesn't prevent or hinder the IRS from processing the Form 8971 and the Schedule(s) A required to be filed along with it.  Errors and omissions that are never inconsequential are those related to a TIN, a beneficiary's surname, and the value of the asset the beneficiary is receiving from the estate.   Note. A TIN is a Social Security Number (SSN), an Employer Identification Number (EIN), an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), or any other number used by the IRS in the administration of tax laws. See Part II—Beneficiary Information, later, for information on obtaining the TIN of a beneficiary of the estate.        Failure to furnish correct Schedules A to beneficiaries by the due date (section 6722).  If the executor of an estate or other person required to file Form 8971 fails to provide a correct Schedule A to a beneficiary and doesn't show reasonable cause, a penalty may be imposed.  The penalty applies if there is a failure to provide the Schedule A by the due date, a failure to include all information required to be shown on the schedule, a failure to include correct information on the schedule, or a failure to provide a correct supplemental Schedule A by the due date.  The penalty applies for each Schedule A required to be provided. The amount of the penalty depends on when a correct Schedule A is provided. The penalty is as follows.  $50 per Schedule A if it is provided within 30 days after the due date. The maximum penalty is $532,000 per year (or $186,000 if the taxpayer qualifies for lower maximum penalties, as described below). $260 per Schedule A if it is provided  more than 30 days after the due date or if it isn't provided.  The maximum penalty is $3,193,000 per year ($1,064,000 if the taxpayer qualifies for lower maximum penalties, as described below).    All penalty amounts shown are subject to adjustment for inflation.    Lower maximum penalties.  You qualify for lower maximum penalties if your average annual gross receipts for the 3 most recent tax years (or for the period you were in existence, if shorter) ending before the calendar year in which the information returns were due are $5 million or less.    Intentional disregard of filing requirements.  If any failure to provide a correct Schedule A is due to intentional disregard of the requirements to provide correct Schedules A, the penalty is at least $530 per Schedule A with no maximum penalty.    Inconsequential error or omission.  An inconsequential error or omission isn't considered a failure to include correct information.  An inconsequential error or omission can’t reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the beneficiary from timely receiving correct information and using the information to report basis on the beneficiary’s own return.  Errors and omissions that are never inconsequential are those related to (a) the value of the asset the beneficiary is receiving from the estate, and (b) a significant item in a beneficiary's address.    Reasonable cause exception to the penalties for failing to file Forms 8971 and Schedules A and for failing to provide Schedules A to beneficiaries.  The penalties for failing to file correct Form 8971 and Schedules A with the IRS and for failing to provide correct Schedules A to beneficiaries won't apply to any failure that  is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. In general,  it must be shown that  the failure was due to an event beyond the taxpayer’s control or due to significant mitigating factors. It must also be shown that the executor or other person required to file acted in a responsible manner and took steps to avoid the failure.       Penalties for Inconsistent Filing Beneficiaries who report basis in property that is inconsistent with the amount on the Schedule A may be liable for a 20% accuracy-related penalty under section 6662.     Obtaining Forms and Publications To File or Use You can access the IRS website 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at IRS.gov to:  Download forms, instructions, and publications; Order IRS products; Research tax questions; Search publications by topic or keyword; and Sign up to receive local and national tax news by email.        Specific Instructions Complete Form 8971 and each attached Schedule A in its entirety.  A form or schedule filed with the IRS without entries in each field won't be processed.  A form with an answer of “unknown” won't be considered a complete return.     Part I — Decedent and Executor Information  Line 3.  Enter the SSN of the decedent.  If the decedent didn't have an SSN, the executor (or other person required to file Form 706) should obtain one for the decedent by filing Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card. You can get Form SS-5 online at www.socialsecurity.gov or by calling the SSA at 1-800-772-1213.    Line 4.  If there is more than one executor, enter the name of one executor and see the instructions for line 8.    Line 6.  Provide only the TIN of the executor listed on line 4 and see the instructions for line 8.    Line 7.  Provide only the address of the executor listed on line 4.  Use Form 8822, Change of Address, to report a change of the executor’s address.  Also, see the instructions for line 8.    Line 8.  Check the box and attach a statement with the name, address, telephone number, and TIN of each executor (if any) other than the one named on line 4.    Line 9.  If the executor made an election on the estate tax return to use alternate valuation under section 2032, provide the alternate valuation date.       Part II — Beneficiary Information A beneficiary is an individual, trust, or other estate who has acquired (or is expected to acquire) property from the estate.  If the executor is also a beneficiary who has acquired (or is expected to acquire) property from the estate, the executor is a beneficiary for purposes of the Form 8971 and Schedule A.  Column A.  Enter the name of each individual, trust, or other estate that acquired (or is expected to acquire) property from the estate.  Retain a copy of the Form 8971 (including all attached Schedule(s) A) for the estate’s records.       Column B.  Enter the TIN of each beneficiary listed.  If the executor of the estate solicited a beneficiary's TIN in writing and hasn’t received it, enter ""requested"" and attach a copy of the solicitation to Form 8971 to avoid inquiries from the IRS. A supplemental Form 8971 and corresponding Schedule A must be filed with the IRS once the TIN has been obtained.    Note. Some foreign beneficiaries may not be required to provide a TIN to the estate. If the foreign beneficiary isn’t required to provide a TIN, enter ""Not Required"" in the TIN entry space.       Column D.  For each beneficiary, enter the date on which the executor gave Schedule A to the beneficiary. See Where To File, earlier.     Return preparer.  Permission to discuss the Form 8971 is limited to the information reported on (or required to be reported on) the Form 8971 and attached Schedule(s) A and doesn't authorize the return preparer to represent the estate before the IRS or to enter into any agreements with the IRS regarding the Form 8971 and attached Schedule(s) A.  Complete and attach Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, if the executor would like the return preparer to represent the estate before the IRS with respect to the Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A or any other matter related to the estate. Completing Form 2848 may authorize the person designated on that form to sign agreements, consents, waivers, or other documents.   Note. When completing Form 2848, remember the executor, not the estate, is the ""taxpayer"" to be listed in line 1, and the TIN listed should also be the executor's TIN. Also, when filling out line 3, enter ""Civil Penalties"" in the Description of the Matter column, ""Form 8971/Schedule A"" in the Tax Form Number column, and the decedent's date of death using the four-digit year and two-digit month as ""YYYYMM"" in the Year(s) or Period(s) column.    Anyone who is paid to prepare the Form 8971 and/or any Schedule A must sign the form as a paid preparer and give a copy of the completed Form 8971 and/or Schedule(s) A to the executor required to file Form 706 or Form 706-NA.   Note. A paid preparer may sign original or amended returns by rubber stamp, mechanical device, or computer software program.          Signature and Verification All executors shown on Form 8971 and listed on any attached statement are responsible for the reporting requirements related to Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A.  However, it is enough for only one of the executors to sign Form 8971. Form 8971 is signed under penalties of perjury and all executors are responsible for the information included on Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A as filed with the IRS and Schedules A provided to beneficiaries.  All executors are also liable for all applicable penalties.     Schedule A — Information Regarding Beneficiaries Acquiring Property From a Decedent Executors of estates filing Form 8971 are required to complete a Schedule A for each beneficiary that acquired (or is expected to acquire) property from the estate.  You will need a copy of the Form 706 or Form 706-NA filed by the estate of the decedent to complete this schedule.  All property acquired (or expected to be acquired) by a beneficiary must be listed on that beneficiary’s Schedule A.  If the executor hasn't determined which beneficiary is to receive an item of property as of the due date of the Form 8971 and Schedule(s) A, the executor must list all items of property that could be used, in whole or in part, to fund the beneficiary’s distribution on that beneficiary’s Schedule A. (This means that the same property may be reflected on more than one Schedule A.) A supplemental Form 8971 and corresponding Schedule(s) A may, but aren’t required to, be filed once the distribution to each such beneficiary has been made.   Note. A cash bequest acquired (or expected to be acquired) by a beneficiary isn’t considered reportable property for purposes of Form 8971/Schedule A.    Use and duplicate page A-2 (Schedule A—Continuation Sheet) if additional space is needed to list the property acquired (or expected to be acquired) by a beneficiary.  Attach a copy of each completed Schedule A to Form 8971 and submit to the IRS.  Provide a copy of each Schedule A only to the beneficiary named on that Schedule A.  Do not provide a copy of the Form 8971 to a beneficiary.  See the instructions under Where To File, earlier.   Column A.  Number the items received by the beneficiary. Continue this numbering on page A-2 of the Schedule A—Continuation Sheet (if necessary).    Column B.  Use the same description in column B that the executor used for the property on the Form 706 or Form 706-NA. Include in column B the schedule and item number where the property was reported on Form 706 or Form 706-NA, as applicable. If the beneficiary acquired (or is expected to acquire) a joint interest, fractional interest, or any other interest in property which is less than 100% of the interest reported on the estate tax return, indicate the interest in the property the beneficiary will acquire. Listings of bulk assets may be attached to Schedule A in lieu of a detailed description of each item that has been acquired (or is expected to be acquired) by a beneficiary. The listing should consist of a related property (for example, stocks held in a single brokerage account) and only include information relevant to basis reporting such as name/description of the property, value, and valuation date. Do not attach property appraisals to Schedule A.  For more information on details to be included by asset type or schedule, see the Instructions for Form 706 or Form 706-NA.    Column C.  An entry (Y or N) is required in this column for each asset.  Indicate ""Y"" only if estate tax was generated and the asset contributed to the estate tax (for example, the asset wasn't subject to a marital or charitable deduction). Generally, any property that qualifies for a marital deduction under section 2056 or 2056A or a charitable deduction under section 2055 won't generate estate tax and ""N"" should be indicated.    Column D.  Generally, the valuation date of property will be the decedent’s date of death. If the estate elected to use an alternate valuation date, list the value of the property on the alternate valuation date.  See section 2032 for additional guidance.    Column E.  List the value reported on Form 706 or Form 706-NA. The value reported in column E should be the fair market value as of the decedent's date of death or any alternate valuation date used for the estate tax return. This value shouldn’t reflect any post-death adjustment in value. The full fair market value of the property acquired (or expected to be acquired) by the beneficiary is to be reported in column E. This value shouldn’t factor in mortgages, non-recourse indebtedness, or other decreases in equity.  For partial interests of property, (including life estates and usufructs) the value reported should reflect the proportional value of the partial interest for each beneficiary. For example, an estate has property valued on the Form 706 at $400,000. The property is being distributed to Beneficiary 1, receiving a 75% interest in the property, and  Beneficiary 2, receiving a 25% interest in the property. Schedule A, Part II, column E should reflect $300,000 on the Schedule A for Beneficiary 1 and $100,000 on the Schedule A for Beneficiary 2. If the value reported on a Schedule A that has already been filed with the IRS or provided to a beneficiary changes (as a result of the resolution of a valuation issue or otherwise), you must file a supplemental Form 8971 and associated Schedule(s) A with the IRS and provide an updated Schedule A to each affected beneficiary no later than 30 days after the adjustment.

General Instructions      Purpose of Form CT-1 These instructions give you some background information about Form CT-1. They tell you who must file Form CT-1, how to complete it line by line, and when and where to file it. Use Form CT-1 to report taxes imposed by the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA). Use Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, or, if applicable, Form 944, Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return, to report federal income taxes withheld from your employees' wages and other compensation.     Who Must File File Form CT-1 if you paid one or more employees compensation subject to tax under RRTA. A payer of sick pay (including a third party) must file Form CT-1 if the sick pay is subject to Tier 1 railroad retirement taxes. Include sick pay payments on lines 8–11 and, if the withholding threshold is met, line 12 of Form CT-1. Follow the reporting procedures for sick pay reporting in section 6 of Pub. 15-A. After you file your first Form CT-1, you must file a return for each year, even if you didn’t pay taxable compensation during the year, until you file a final return.   Disregarded entities and qualified subchapter S subsidiaries (QSubs). Eligible single-owner disregarded entities and QSubs are treated as separate entities for employment tax purposes. Eligible single-member entities that haven’t elected to be taxed as corporations must report and pay employment taxes on compensation paid to their employees using the entities' own names and employer identification numbers (EINs). See Regulations sections 1.1361-4(a)(7) and 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv).     Where To File Send Form CT-1 to: Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Center Kansas City, MO 64999-0048       When To File File Form CT-1 by March 2, 2020.     Definitions The terms ""employer"" and ""employee"" used in these instructions are defined in section 3231 and in its regulations.    Compensation Compensation means payment in money, meaning currency issued by a recognized authority as a medium of exchange, for services performed as an employee of one or more employers. It includes payment for time lost as an employee. A few exceptions are described below under Exceptions.  Group-term life insurance. Include in compensation the cost of group-term life insurance over $50,000 you provide to an employee. This amount is subject to Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes, but not to federal income tax withholding. Include this amount on your employee's Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. Former employees for whom you paid the cost of group-term life insurance over $50,000 must pay the employee's share of these taxes with their Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors. You’re not required to collect those taxes. For former employees, you must include on Form W-2 the part of compensation that consists of the cost of group-term life insurance over $50,000. You must also separately report on Form W-2 the amount of railroad retirement taxes owed by the former employee for coverage provided after separation from service. For more information, see section 2 of Pub. 15-B and the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3.   Timing. Compensation is considered paid when it is actually paid or when it is constructively paid. It is constructively paid when it is set apart for the employee, or credited to an account the employee can control, without any substantial limit or condition on how and when the payment is to be made. Any compensation paid during the current year that was earned in a prior year is taxable at the current year's tax rates; you must include the compensation with the current year's compensation on Form CT-1, lines 1–12, as appropriate. An exception applies to nonqualified deferred compensation that was subject to Tier 1 and Tier 2 tax in a prior year. See the rules for nonqualified deferred compensation plans in section 5 of Pub. 15-A.   Exceptions. Compensation doesn't include the following.     Certain benefits provided to or on behalf of an employee if at the time the benefits are provided it is reasonable to believe the employee can exclude such benefits from income. For information on what benefits are excludable, see Pub. 15-B. Examples of this type of benefit include:    Certain employee achievement awards under section 74(c),   Certain scholarship and fellowship grants under section 117,   Certain fringe benefits under section 132, and   Employer payments to an Archer MSA under section 220 or health savings accounts (HSAs) under section 223.      Stock or stock options.   Payments made specifically for traveling or other bona fide and necessary expenses that meet the rules in the regulations under section 62.   Payments for services performed by a nonresident alien temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraphs (F), (J), (M), or (Q) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.   Compensation under $25 earned in any month by an employee in the service of a local lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer.         Exceptions for sickness or accident disability payments. For purposes of employee and employer Tier 1 taxes, compensation doesn't include sickness or accident disability payments made to or on behalf of an employee or dependents:     Under a workers' compensation law,   Under section 2(a) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act for days of sickness due to an on-the-job injury,    Under the Railroad Retirement Act, or   More than 6 months after the calendar month the employee last worked.      For purposes of Tier 2 taxes, compensation doesn't include payments made to or on behalf of an employee or dependents under a sickness or accident disability plan or a medical or hospitalization plan in connection with sickness or accident disability.        Employer and Employee Taxes    Tax Rates and Compensation Bases             Tax Rates  			Compensation 			Paid in 2019     Tier 1     Employer and Employee: Each pay 6.2% of first $132,900   Tier 1 Medicare     Employer and Employee: Each pay 1.45% of All   Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax withholding         Employee: Pays 0.9% on compensation exceeding     $200,000   Tier 2     Employer: Pays 13.1% of first $98,700   Employee: Pays 4.9% of first $98,700           Employer Taxes Employers must pay both Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes, except for Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax. Tier 1 tax is divided into two parts. The amount of compensation subject to each tax is different. See the table above for the 2019 tax rates and compensation bases.  Concurrent employment. If two or more related corporations that are rail employers employ the same individual at the same time and pay that individual through a common paymaster that is one of the corporations, the corporations are considered a single employer. They have to pay, in total, no more in railroad retirement taxes than a single employer would. See Regulations section 31.3121(s)-1 for more information.   Successor employers. Successor employers should see section 3231(e)(2)(C) and Pub. 15 to see if they can use the predecessor's compensation paid against the maximum compensation bases.      Employee Taxes You must withhold the employee's part of Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes. See the table under Employer and Employee Taxes, earlier, for the tax rates and compensation bases. See Tips below for information on the employee tax on tips.  Withholding or payment of employee tax by employer. You must collect the employee railroad retirement tax from each employee by withholding it from employee compensation. If you don't withhold the employee tax, you must still pay the tax. If you withhold too much or too little tax because you can't determine the correct amount, correct the amount withheld by an adjustment, credit, or refund according to the applicable regulations. If you pay the railroad retirement tax for your employee rather than withholding it, the amount of the employee's compensation is increased by the amount of that tax. See Rev. Proc. 83-43,1983-1 C.B. 778, for information on how to figure and report the proper amounts.   Tips. Your employee must report cash tips to you by the 10th day of the month following the month the tips are received. The report should include charged tips you paid over to the employee for charge customers, tips the employee received directly from customers, and tips received from other employees under any tip-sharing arrangement. Both directly and indirectly tipped employees must report tips to you. Cash tips must be reported for every month, unless the cash tips for the month are less than $20. Stop collecting the Tier 1 Employee tax when his or her compensation and tips for tax year 2019 reach $132,900. Collect the Tier 1 Employee Medicare tax for the whole year on all compensation and tips. Collect the Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax withholding on compensation and tips that exceed $200,000 for the calendar year. An employee must furnish you with a written (or electronic) statement of cash tips, signed by the employee, showing (a) his or her name, address, and social security number; (b) your name and address; (c) the month or period for which the statement is furnished; and (d) the total amount of cash tips. Pub. 1244, Employee's Daily Record of Tips and Report to Employer, a booklet for daily entry of tips and forms to report tips to employers, is available at IRS.gov/Forms. Tips are considered to be paid at the time the employee reports them to you. You must collect both employee railroad retirement tax and federal income tax on cash tips reported to you from the employee's compensation (after withholding employee railroad retirement and federal income tax related to the nontip compensation) or from other funds the employee makes available. Apply the compensation or other funds first to the railroad retirement tax and then to federal income tax. You don't have to pay employer railroad retirement taxes on tips. If, by the 10th of the month after the month you received an employee's tip income report, you don't have enough employee funds available to withhold the employee tax, you may report the excess amount without withholding the related tax. Include the tips your employees report to you on lines 4, 5, 6, and 7, even if you were unable to withhold the employee's share of tax. Then report the uncollected Tier 1 Employee tax, Tier 1 Employee Medicare tax, Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax withholding, and Tier 2 Employee tax on tips on line 14. See section 6 in Pub. 15.       Depositing Taxes For Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes, you’re either a monthly schedule depositor or a semiweekly schedule depositor. However, see the $2,500 Rule and the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule under Exceptions to the Deposit Rules,later. The terms ""monthly schedule depositor"" and ""semiweekly schedule depositor"" identify which set of rules you must follow when a tax liability arises (for example, when you have a payday). They don't refer to how often your business pays its employees or to how often you’re required to make deposits. If you were a monthly schedule depositor for the entire year, complete the Monthly Summary of Railroad Retirement Tax Liability in Part II of Form CT-1. If you were a semiweekly schedule depositor during any part of the year or you accumulated $100,000 or more on any day during a deposit period, you must complete Form 945-A, Annual Record of Federal Tax Liability.    Lookback Period Before each year begins, you must determine the deposit schedule to follow for depositing Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes for a calendar year. This is determined from the total taxes reported on your Form CT-1 for the calendar year lookback period. The lookback period is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 2020 is calendar year 2018. Use the table below to determine which deposit schedule to follow for 2020.         IF you reported taxes 			for the lookback period (2018) of... THEN for 2020 you’re a...     $50,000 or less Monthly schedule depositor   More than $50,000 Semiweekly schedule depositor          Example. Rose Co. reported Form CT-1 taxes as follows.    2018 Form CT-1—$49,000.   2019 Form CT-1—$52,000.      Rose Co. is a monthly schedule depositor for 2020 because its Form CT-1 taxes for its lookback period (calendar year 2018) weren't more than $50,000. However, for 2021, Rose Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor because the total taxes exceeded $50,000 for its lookback period (calendar year 2019).   New employer. If you’re a new employer, your taxes for both years of the lookback period are considered to be zero. Therefore, you’re a monthly schedule depositor for the first and second years of your business. However, see $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule, later.   Adjustments and the lookback rule. To determine the amount of taxes paid for the lookback period, use only the Form CT-1 taxes reported on your original return. Adjustments to a return for a prior period aren't taken into account in determining the taxes for that prior period.    Example. Maple Co. originally reported Form CT-1 taxes of $45,000 for the lookback period (2018). Maple Co. discovered in March 2020 that the tax during the lookback period (2018) was understated by $10,000 and will correct this error with an adjustment on Form CT-1 X filed for 2018.  Maple Co. is a monthly schedule depositor for 2020 because the lookback period Form CT-1 taxes are based on the amount originally reported ($45,000), which wasn't more than $50,000. For purposes of the lookback rule, the $10,000 adjustment doesn't affect either 2018 taxes or 2020 taxes. See Treasury Decision 9405, available at IRS.gov/irb/2008-32_IRB#TD-9405.       When To Deposit       Monthly Schedule Depositor    If you’re a monthly schedule depositor, deposit employer and employee Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes accumulated during a calendar month by the 15th day of the following month.    Example. Spruce Co. is a monthly schedule depositor with seasonal employees. Spruce Co. paid compensation each Friday during May but didn't pay any compensation during June. Under the monthly schedule deposit rule, Spruce Co. must deposit the combined taxes for the May paydays by June 15. Spruce Co. doesn't have a deposit requirement for June (due by July 15) because no compensation was paid and, therefore, Spruce Co. doesn't have a tax liability for the month.         Semiweekly Schedule Depositor    If you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, use the table below to determine when to make deposits.         Deposit Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes 			for payments made on... No later than...     Wednesday, Thursday, and/or Friday The following Wednesday   Saturday, Sunday, Monday, 			and/or Tuesday The following Friday          Example. Green, Inc., a semiweekly schedule depositor, pays compensation on the last Friday of each month. Although Green, Inc., is a semiweekly schedule depositor, Green, Inc., will deposit just once a month because Green, Inc., pays compensation only once a month. The deposit, however, will be made under the semiweekly deposit schedule as follows: Green, Inc.’s taxes for the April 24, 2020 (Friday), payday must be deposited by April 29, 2020 (Wednesday). Under the semiweekly deposit rule, taxes arising on Wednesday through Friday must be deposited by the following Wednesday.     The last day of the calendar year ends the semiweekly deposit period and begins a new one.        Deposits Due on Business Days Only    If a deposit is required to be made on a day that isn't a business day, the deposit is considered to have been made timely if it is made by the close of the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For example, if a deposit is due on a Friday and Friday is a legal holiday, the deposit will be considered timely if it is made by the following Monday (if that Monday is a business day). The term ""legal holiday"" for deposit purposes includes only those legal holidays in the District of Columbia. For a list of legal holidays, see section 11 of Pub. 15. Semiweekly schedule depositors will always have at least 3 business days following the close of the semiweekly period to make a deposit. If any of the 3 weekdays after the end of a semiweekly period is a legal holiday, you have 1 additional day to deposit. For example, if you have Form CT-1 taxes accumulated for payments made on Friday and the following Monday is a legal holiday, the deposit normally due on Wednesday may be made on Thursday (allowing 3 business days to make the deposit).        Exceptions to the Deposit Rules    The two exceptions that apply to the above deposit rules are the:    $2,500 Rule, and   $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule.       $2,500 Rule. If your total Form CT-1 taxes for the year are less than $2,500 and the taxes are fully paid with a timely filed Form CT-1, no deposits are required. However, if you’re unsure that you will accumulate less than $2,500, deposit under the appropriate deposit rules so that you won't be subject to deposit penalties.   $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule. If you accumulate undeposited taxes of $100,000 or more on any day during a deposit period, you must deposit the taxes by the next business day regardless of whether you’re a monthly or semiweekly schedule depositor. If you’re a monthly schedule depositor and you accumulate $100,000 or more on any day during the month, you become a semiweekly schedule depositor on the next day for the remainder of the calendar year and for the following year. Once a semiweekly schedule depositor accumulates $100,000 or more in a deposit period, it must stop accumulating at the end of that day and begin to accumulate anew on the next day. The following examples explain this rule.    Example of $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule.  Fir Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor. On Monday, Fir Co. accumulates taxes of $110,000 and must deposit this amount by Tuesday, the next business day. On Tuesday, Fir Co. accumulates additional taxes of $30,000. Because the $30,000 isn't added to the previous $110,000, Fir Co. must deposit the $30,000 by Friday using the semiweekly deposit schedule.     Example of $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule during the first year of business. Elm, Inc., started its business on May 4, 2020. Because this was the first year of its business, its Form CT-1 taxes for its lookback period (2018) are considered to be zero, and Elm, Inc., is a monthly schedule depositor. On Wednesday, May 6, it paid compensation for the first time and accumulated taxes of $40,000. On Friday, May 8, it paid compensation and accumulated taxes of $60,000, bringing its total accumulated (undeposited) taxes to $100,000. Because Elm, Inc., accumulated $100,000 or more on May 8 (Friday), Elm, Inc., must deposit the $100,000 by May 11 (Monday), the next business day. Elm, Inc., became a semiweekly schedule depositor on May 9. Elm, Inc., will be a semiweekly schedule depositor for the rest of 2020 and for 2021.     Example of when $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule doesn't apply. Oak Co., a semiweekly schedule depositor, accumulated taxes of $95,000 on a Tuesday (of a Saturday-through-Tuesday deposit period) and accumulated $10,000 on Wednesday (of a Wednesday-through-Friday deposit period). Because the $10,000 was accumulated in a deposit period different from the one in which the $95,000 was accumulated, the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule doesn’t apply. Thus, Oak Co. must deposit $95,000 by Friday and $10,000 by the following Wednesday.        Electronic Deposit Requirement You must use EFT to make all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made using EFTPS. To get more information about EFTPS or to enroll in EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov, or call 800-555-4477 or 800-733-4829 (TDD). Additional information about EFTPS is also available in Pub. 966.    For an EFTPS deposit to be on time, you must submit the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date the deposit is due.  Same-day wire payment option. If you fail to submit a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Collection Service (FTCS) to make a same-day wire payment. To use the same-day wire payment method, you will need to make arrangements with your financial institution ahead of time. Please check with your financial institution regarding availability, deadlines, and costs. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for payments made this way. To learn more about the information you will need to give your financial institution to make a same-day wire payment, go to IRS.gov/SameDayWire.   Accuracy of Deposits Rule. You’re required to deposit 100% of your railroad retirement taxes on or before the deposit due date. However, penalties won't be applied for depositing less than 100% if both of the following conditions are met.    Any deposit shortfall doesn't exceed the greater of $100 or 2% of the amount of taxes otherwise required to be deposited.   The deposit shortfall is paid or deposited by the shortfall makeup date for each type of depositor as described below.    Monthly schedule depositor. Deposit the shortfall or pay it with your return by the due date of Form CT-1. You may pay the shortfall with Form CT-1 even if the amount is $2,500 or more.   Semiweekly schedule depositor. Deposit the shortfall by the earlier of the first Wednesday or Friday on or after the 15th of the month following the month in which the shortfall occurred. For example, if a semiweekly schedule depositor has a deposit shortfall during June 2020, the shortfall makeup date is July 15, 2020 (Wednesday).               Penalties and Interest The law provides penalties for failure to file a return, late filing of a return, late payment of taxes, failure to make deposits, and late deposits unless filing and/or paying late is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Interest is charged on taxes paid late at the rate set by law. For more information, see Pub. 15. If you receive a notice about a penalty after you file this return, reply to the notice with an explanation and we will determine if you meet reasonable cause criteria. Don't attach an explanation when you file your return. Use Form 843 to request abatement of assessed penalties or interest. Don't request abatement of assessed penalties or interest on Form CT-1 or Form CT-1 X.  Order in which deposits are applied. Generally, tax deposits are applied first to the most recent tax liability within the specified tax period to which the deposit relates. If you receive a failure-to-deposit penalty notice, you may designate how your payment is to be applied in order to minimize the amount of the penalty. You must respond within 90 days of the date of the notice. Follow the instructions on the notice you received. See Rev. Proc. 2001-58 for more information. You can find Rev. Proc. 2001-58 on page 579 of Internal Revenue Bulletin 2001-50 at IRS.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb01-50.pdf.   Trust fund recovery penalty.  If taxes that must be withheld (that is, trust fund taxes) aren't withheld or aren't deposited or paid to the United States Treasury, the trust fund recovery penalty may apply. The penalty is 100% of the unpaid trust fund tax. If these unpaid taxes can't be immediately collected from the employer or business, the trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to be responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. For more information, see Trust Fund Recovery Penalty in section 11 of Pub. 15.       Specific Instructions      Final Return If you stop paying taxable compensation and won't have to file Form CT-1 in the future, you must file a final return and check the final return box at the top of Form CT-1 under ""2019."" The final return should be accompanied by a statement providing the last date on which you paid compensation that you reported on Form CT-1, the address at which the records for your Forms CT-1 will be kept, and the name of the person keeping the records. If the business has been transferred to another person, the statement should include the name and address of the transferee and the date of the transfer. If the business wasn't transferred or the transferee isn't known, the statement should so state.    Processing of your return may be delayed if you don't provide the required amounts in the Compensation and Tax columns.     Line 1—Tier 1 Employer Tax Enter the compensation (other than tips and sick pay) subject to Tier 1 Employer tax in the Compensation column. Multiply by 6.2% and enter the result in the Tax column. The total amount listed in the Compensation column for lines 1 and 8 combined may not be more than $132,900 per employee.     Line 2—Tier 1 Employer Medicare Tax Enter the compensation (other than tips and sick pay) subject to Tier 1 Employer Medicare tax in the Compensation column. Multiply by 1.45% and enter the result in the Tax column.     Line 3—Tier 2 Employer Tax Enter the compensation (other than tips) subject to Tier 2 Employer tax in the Compensation column. Don't enter more than $98,700 per employee. Multiply by 13.1% and enter the result in the Tax column.     Line 4—Tier 1 Employee Tax Enter the compensation, including tips reported (but excluding sick pay), subject to Tier 1 Employee tax in the Compensation column. Multiply by 6.2% and enter the result in the Tax column. The total amount listed in the Compensation column for lines 4 and 10 combined may not be more than $132,900 per employee. Stop collecting the 6.2% Tier 1 Employee tax when the employee's compensation (including sick pay) and tips reach the maximum for the year ($132,900 for 2019). However, your liability for Tier 1 Employer tax on compensation continues until the compensation (including sick pay), but not including tips, totals $132,900 for the year.     Line 5—Tier 1 Employee Medicare Tax Enter the compensation, including tips reported (but excluding sick pay), subject to Tier 1 Employee Medicare tax in the Compensation column. Multiply by 1.45% and enter the result in the Tax column. For information on reporting tips, see Tips, earlier.     Line 6—Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax Withholding Enter the compensation, including tips reported (but excluding sick pay), that is subject to Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax withholding. You’re required to begin withholding Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which you pay compensation in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax is only imposed on the employee. There is no employer share of Tier 1 Additional Medicare Tax. All compensation (including sick pay) that is subject to Tier 1 Medicare tax is subject to Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax if paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold. Go to IRS.gov/ADMT for more information on Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax.     Line 7—Tier 2 Employee Tax Enter the compensation, including tips reported, subject to Tier 2 Employee tax in the Compensation column. Only the first $98,700 of the employee's compensation (including tips) for 2019 is subject to this tax. Multiply by 4.9% and enter the result in the Tax column. For information on reporting tips, see Tips, earlier.    Any compensation paid during the current year that was earned in prior years (reported to the Railroad Retirement Board on Form BA-4, Report of Creditable Compensation Adjustments) is taxable at the current year tax rates, unless special timing rules for nonqualified deferred compensation apply. See Pub.15-A. Include such compensation with current year compensation on lines 1–7, as appropriate.     Lines 8–12—Tier 1 Taxes on Sick Pay Enter any sick pay payments during the year that are subject to Tier 1 taxes, Tier 1 Medicare taxes, and Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax withholding in the Compensation column. Multiply by the rate for the line and enter the result in the Tax column for that line. For Tier 1 Employer taxes, the total amount listed in the Compensation column for lines 1 and 8 combined may not be more than $132,900 per employee. For Tier 1 Employee taxes, the total amount listed in the Compensation column for lines 4 and 10 combined may not be more than $132,900 per employee. Tier 1 Medicare taxes aren't subject to a dollar limitation. All compensation (including sick pay) that is subject to Tier 1 Medicare tax is subject to Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax if paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold. If you’re a railroad employer paying your employees sick pay, or a third-party payer who didn't notify the employer of the payments (thereby subject to the employee and employer tax), make entries on lines 8–12. If you’re subject to only the employer or employee tax, complete only the applicable lines. Multiply by the appropriate rates and enter the results in the Tax column.     Line 13—Total Tax Based on Compensation Add lines 1 through 12 and enter the result on line 13.     Line 14—Adjustments to Taxes Based on Compensation    Don't use line 14 for prior period adjustments. Make all prior period adjustments on Form CT-1 X. Enter on line 14:    A fractions-of-cents adjustment (see Adjustment for fractions of cents, later);   Credits for overpayments of penalty or interest paid on tax for earlier years; and   Any uncollected Tier 1 Employee tax, Tier 1 Employee Medicare tax, Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax, and Tier 2 Employee tax on tips.      Enter the total of these adjustments in the Tax column. If you’re reporting both an addition and a subtraction, enter only the difference between the two on line 14. If the net adjustment is negative, report the amount on line 14 using a minus sign, if possible. If your computer software doesn't allow the use of minus signs, you may use parentheses. Don't include on line 14 any 2018 overpayment that is applied to this year's return (this is included on line 16).  Required statement. Except for adjustments for fractions of cents, explain amounts entered on line 14 in a separate statement. Include your name, EIN, calendar year of the return, and ""Form CT-1"" on each page you attach. Include in the statement the following information.     An explanation of the item the adjustment is intended to correct showing the compensation subject to Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes and their respective tax rates.   The amount of the adjustment.   The name and account number of any employee from whom employee tax was undercollected or overcollected.   How you and the employee have settled any undercollection or overcollection of employee tax.        Adjustment for fractions of cents. If there is a small difference between the total employee tax (lines 4–7 and 10–12) and the total actually withheld from employee compensation including tips, it may be caused by rounding to the nearest cent each time you figured payroll. The difference, positive or negative, is your fractions-of-cents adjustment to be reported on line 14. If the actual amount withheld is less, report a negative adjustment in the entry space. If the actual amount is more, report a positive adjustment.    If this is the only entry on line 14, you’re not required to attach a statement explaining the adjustment.      Line 15—Total Railroad Retirement Taxes Based on Compensation Combine the amounts shown on lines 13 and 14 and enter the result on line 15.     Line 16—Total Deposits for the Year Enter the total Form CT-1 deposits for the year, including any overpayment that you applied from filing Form CT-1 X and any overpayment that you applied from your 2018 return.     Line 17—Balance Due If line 15 is more than line 16, enter the difference on line 17. Otherwise, see Line 18—Overpayment below. You don't have to pay if line 17 is under $1. Generally, you should show a balance due on line 17 only if your total railroad retirement taxes based on compensation for the year (line 15) are less than $2,500. However, see Accuracy of Deposits Rule, earlier, regarding payments made under the accuracy of deposits rule. If you were required to make federal tax deposits, pay the amount shown on line 17 by EFT. If you weren't required to make federal tax deposits or you're a monthly schedule depositor making a payment under the accuracy of deposits rule, you may pay the amount shown on line 17 by EFT, check, or money order. For more information on electronic payment options, go to IRS.gov/Payments. If you pay by EFT, file your return using the address under Where To File, earlier. Don't file Form CT-1(V), Payment Voucher. If you pay by check or money order, make it payable to “United States Treasury.” Enter your EIN, ""Form CT-1,"" and ""2019"" on your check or money order. Complete Form CT-1(V) and enclose with Form CT-1.     Line 18—Overpayment If line 16 is more than line 15, enter the difference on line 18. Never make an entry on both lines 18 and 17. If line 18 is less than $1, we will send you a refund or apply it to your next return only if you ask us in writing to do so. If you deposited more than the correct amount for the year, you can have the overpayment refunded or applied to your next return by checking the appropriate box on line 18. Check only one box on line 18. If you don't check either box or if you check both boxes, generally we will apply the overpayment to your next return. Regardless of any boxes you check or don't check, we may apply your overpayment to any past due tax account that is shown in our records under your EIN.     Part II. Record of Railroad Retirement Tax Liability This is a summary of your yearly tax liability, not a summary of deposits made. If line 15 is less than $2,500, don't complete Part II or Form 945-A. If you’re a monthly schedule depositor, enter your tax liability for each month and figure the total liability for the year. If you don't enter your tax liability for each month, the IRS won't know when you should have made deposits and may assess an “averaged” failure-to-deposit penalty. See section 11 of Pub. 15. If your tax liability for any month is negative, don't enter a negative amount for the month. Instead, enter zero for the month and subtract that negative amount from your tax liability for the next month.    The amount shown on line V must equal the amount shown on line 15. If you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor or if you accumulate $100,000 or more in tax liability on any day in a deposit period, you must complete Form 945-A and file it with Form CT-1. Don't complete lines I–V if you file Form 945-A.     Third-Party Designee If you want to allow an employee of your business, a return preparer, or another third party to discuss your 2019 Form CT-1 with the IRS, check the ""Yes"" box in the Third-Party Designee section. Also, enter the designee's name, phone number, and any five digits that person chooses as his or her personal identification number (PIN). By checking ""Yes"" you authorize the IRS to talk to the person you named (your designee) about any questions we may have while we process your return. You also authorize your designee to do all of the following.    Give us any information that is missing from your return.   Call us for information about processing your return.   Respond to certain IRS notices that you have shared with the designee about math errors and return preparation. The IRS won't send notices to your designee.      You’re not authorizing the designee to receive any refund check, bind you to anything (including additional tax liability), or otherwise represent you before the IRS. If you want to expand the designee's authority, see Pub. 947. The authorization will automatically expire 1 year from the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing your 2019 Form CT-1. If you or your designee wants to revoke this authorization, send the revocation or withdrawal to the IRS office at which you file your Form CT-1.     Who Must Sign The following persons are authorized to sign the return for each type of business entity.    Sole proprietorship—The individual who owns the business.   Corporation (including a limited liability company (LLC) treated as a corporation)—The president, vice president, or other principal officer duly authorized to sign.   Partnership (including an LLC treated as a partnership) or unincorporated organization—A responsible and duly authorized partner, member, or officer having knowledge of its affairs.   Single-member LLC treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes—The owner of the LLC or a principal officer duly authorized to sign.   Trust or estate—The fiduciary.      Form CT-1 also may be signed by a duly authorized agent of the taxpayer if a valid power of attorney has been filed.  Alternative signature method. Corporate officers or duly authorized agents may sign Form CT-1 by rubber stamp, mechanical device, or computer software program. For details and required documentation, see Rev. Proc. 2005-39, 2005-28 I.R.B. 82, available at IRS.gov/irb/2005-28_IRB#RP-2005-39.      Paid Preparer Use Only A paid preparer must sign Form CT-1 and provide the information in the Paid Preparer Use Only section of Part I if the preparer was paid to prepare Form CT-1 and isn't an employee of the filing entity. The preparer must give you a copy of the return in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS. If you're a paid preparer, enter your Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) in the space provided. Include your complete address. If you work for a firm, enter the firm's name and the EIN of the firm. You can apply for a PTIN online or by filing Form W-12. For more information about applying for a PTIN online, go to IRS.gov/PTIN. You can't use your PTIN in place of the EIN of the tax preparation firm. Generally, you’re not required to complete this section if you’re filing the return as a reporting agent and have a valid Form 8655 on file with the IRS. However, a reporting agent must complete this section if the reporting agent offered legal advice, for example, by advising the client on determining whether its workers are employees or independent contractors for federal tax purposes.

360,Instructions for Form W-8EXP (07/2017),"   Instructions for Form W-8EXP (07/2017) Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting  Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.  Revised: 07/2017     General Instructions  Future developments.  For the latest information about developments related to Form W-8EXP and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to IRS.gov/FormW8EXP.      What’s New These instructions have been updated to reflect temporary and final regulations under chapters 3 and 4 published in January 2017. These instructions include additional information on when a foreign TIN is required to be included on Form W-8EXP. In addition, these instructions include information about the use of electronic signatures.     Purpose of Form Under chapter 3, foreign persons are subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of interest (including certain original issue discount (OID)), dividends, rents, premiums, annuities, compensation for, or in expectation of, services performed, or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income. This tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441 or 1442 on that amount. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person for the benefit of the beneficial owner. Foreign persons are also subject to tax at graduated rates on income they earn that is considered effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person invests in a partnership that conducts a U.S. trade or business, the foreign person is considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The partnership is required to withhold tax under section 1446 on the foreign person’s distributive share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. If you receive certain types of income, you must provide Form W-8EXP to:   Establish that you are not a U.S. person; Claim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8EXP is given; and Claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding as a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession.    In general, payments to a foreign government (including a foreign central bank of issue wholly-owned by a foreign sovereign) from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, other domestic securities, financial instruments held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy, and interest on deposits in banks in the United States are exempt from tax under section 892 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Payments other than those described above, including income derived in the U.S. from the conduct of a commercial activity, income received from a controlled commercial entity (including gain from the disposition of any interest in a controlled commercial entity), and income received by a controlled commercial entity, do not qualify for exemption from tax under section 892 or exemption from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. See Temporary Regulations section 1.892-3T. In addition, certain distributions to a foreign government from a real estate investment trust (REIT) may not be eligible for relief from withholding and may be subject to withholding at 35% of the gain realized. For the definition of ""commercial activities,"" see Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T. Amounts allocable to a foreign person from a partnership’s trade or business in the United States are considered derived from a commercial activity in the United States. The partnership's net effectively connected taxable income is subject to withholding under section 1446. In general, payments to an international organization from investment in the United States in stocks, bonds and other domestic securities, interest on deposits in banks in the United States, and payments from any other source within the United States are exempt from tax under section 892 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. See Temporary Regulations section 1.892-6T. Payments to a foreign central bank of issue (whether or not wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) or to the Bank for International Settlements from obligations of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or from interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business, are also generally exempt from tax under section 895 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. In addition, payments to a foreign central bank of issue from bankers’ acceptances are exempt from tax under section 871(i)(2)(C) and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Effectively connected income or gain from a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States may be subject to withholding under section 1446. Payments to a foreign tax-exempt organization of certain types of U.S. source income are also generally exempt from tax and exempt from withholding. Gross investment income of a foreign private foundation, however, is subject to withholding under section 1443(b) at a rate of 4%. Effectively connected income or gain from a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States may be subject to withholding under section 1446. Payments to a government of a possession of the United States are generally exempt from tax and withholding under section 115(2). To establish eligibility for exemption from 30% tax and withholding for chapter 3 purposes under sections 892, 895, 501(c), or 115(2), a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession must provide a Form W-8EXP to a withholding agent or payer with all necessary documentation. The withholding agent or payer of the income may rely on a properly completed Form W-8EXP to treat the payment, credit, or allocation associated with the Form W-8EXP as being made to a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession exempt from withholding at the 30% rate (or, where appropriate, subject to withholding at a 4% rate). Provide Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid, credited, or allocated to you. Failure by a beneficial owner to provide a Form W-8EXP when requested may lead to withholding at the 30% rate, the backup withholding rate, or the rate applicable under section 1446. In addition to the requirements of chapter 3, chapter 4 requires withholding agents to identify chapter 4 status of payees receiving withholdable payments to determine whether withholding applies under chapter 4. Under chapter 4, certain foreign governments, foreign central banks, international organizations, and foreign entities described in section 501(c) (other than an insurance company described in section 501(c)(15)) are not subject to withholding under chapter 4. A withholding agent may request this Form W-8EXP to establish your chapter 4 status and avoid withholding. Chapter 4 also requires participating FFIs and certain registered deemed-compliant FFIs to document entity account holders in order to determine their chapter 4 status regardless of whether withholding applies to any payments made to the entities. If you maintain an account with an FFI and have a chapter 4 status shown in Part I, line 4 of this form, provide this Form W-8EXP when requested by the FFI in order to document your chapter 4 status.  Additional information.  For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.    Who must provide Form W-8EXP.  You must give Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession receiving a withholdable payment or receiving a payment subject to chapter 3 withholding, or are such an entity maintaining an account with an FFI requesting this form.  Do not use Form W-8EXP if:   You are not a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession receiving amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E, or Form W-8ECI. For example, if you are a foreign tax-exempt organization claiming a benefit under an income tax treaty, provide Form W-8BEN-E. You are receiving withholdable payments from a withholding agent requesting this form and you do not have a chapter 4 status identified in Part I, line 4 of this form. You are acting as an intermediary (that is, acting not for your own account, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian). Instead, provide Form W-8IMY. You are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI. You are a tax-exempt organization receiving unrelated business taxable income subject to withholding under section 1443(a). Instead, provide Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8ECI (as applicable) for this portion of your income.  You are a foreign partnership, a foreign simple trust, or a foreign grantor trust. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY. However, a foreign grantor trust is required to provide documentation of its grantor or other owner for purposes of section 1446. See Regulations section 1.1446-1.       Giving Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent.  Do not send Form W-8EXP to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this person will be the one from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. Generally, a separate Form W-8EXP must be given to each withholding agent.  Give Form W-8EXP to the person requesting it before the payment is made, credited, or allocated to you or your account. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold tax at the chapter 3 or chapter 4 30% rate, the backup withholding rate (determined under section 3406), or the rate applicable under section 1446. If you receive more than one type of income from a single withholding agent, the withholding agent may require you to submit a Form W-8EXP for each different type of income.    Expiration of Form W-8EXP.  Generally, a Form W-8EXP remains in effect indefinitely until a change of circumstances makes any information provided on the form incorrect. In some cases, however, Form W-8EXP will remain valid only for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year. For example, a Form W-8EXP provided on February 15, 2015, by a controlled entity of a foreign government would be subject to the three-year validity period and thus would expire on December 31, 2018, for chapter 3 purposes. For more exceptions to the indefinite validity period, see Regulations section 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii) for chapter 3 purposes and Regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii) for chapter 4 purposes.    Change in circumstances.  If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8EXP you have submitted incorrect, you must notify the withholding agent within 30 days of the change in circumstances and you must file a new Form W-8EXP or other appropriate form.       Definitions  Amounts exempt from tax under section 895.  Section 895 generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income a foreign central bank of issue receives from obligations of the United States (or of any agency or instrumentality thereof) or from interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business unless such obligations or deposits are held for, or used in connection with, the conduct of commercial banking functions or other commercial activities of the foreign central bank of issue.    Amounts exempt from tax under section 892.  Only a foreign government or an international organization as defined below qualifies for exemption from taxation under section 892. Section 892 generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income a foreign government receives from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, or other domestic securities; financial instruments held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy; and interest on deposits in banks in the United States of monies belonging to the foreign government. Income of a foreign government from any of the following sources is not exempt from U.S. taxation.   The conduct of any commercial activity. A controlled commercial entity. The disposition of any interest in a controlled commercial entity. For the definition of ""commercial activity,"" see Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T.    Section 892 also generally excludes from gross income and exempts from U.S. taxation income of an international organization received from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, or other domestic securities and interest on deposits in banks in the United States of monies belonging to the international organization or from any other source within the United States.    Amounts subject to withholding.  Generally, an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums), as well as other specific items of income described in Regulations section 1.1441-2 (such as interest on bank deposits and short-term OID). For purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner’s share of the partnership’s effectively connected taxable income. Generally, an amount subject to chapter 4 withholding is an amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment as defined in Regulations section 1.1473-1(a) to which an exception does not apply under chapter 4. The exemptions from withholding or taxation provided for under chapter 3 are not applicable when determining whether withholding applies under chapter 4. For exceptions applicable to the definition of a withholdable payment, see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4) (exempting, for example, certain nonfinancial payments).    Beneficial owner.  For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the payment in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income. Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee, or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself. These beneficial owner rules apply primarily for purposes of withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. The rules also generally apply for purposes of section 1446, with a few exceptions. See Regulations section 1.1446-1 for instances where the documentation requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 differ from section 1446.    Chapter 3.  Chapter 3 means Chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations). Chapter 3 contains sections 1441 through 1464.    Chapter 4.  Chapter 4 means Chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Taxes to Enforce Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts). Chapter 4 contains sections 1471 through 1474.    Commercial activities.  For purposes of chapter 4, commercial activities are financial activities of a type engaged in by an insurance company, custodial institution, or depository institution (including the act of accepting deposits). An exempt beneficial owner will not be considered exempt for chapter 4 purposes with respect to payments derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity. See Regulations section 1.1471-6(h), including limitations on the scope of a commercial financial activity. For purposes of chapter 3, commercial activities are described in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T.    Controlled commercial entity.  A controlled commercial entity is an entity engaged in commercial activities described in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-4T (whether within or outside the United States) if the foreign government holds:  Any interest in the entity that is 50% or more of the total of all interests in the entity, or A sufficient interest or any other interest in the entity which provides the foreign government with effective practical control of the entity.    An entity includes a corporation, a partnership, a trust (including a pension trust), and an estate. A partnership’s commercial activities are attributable to its general and limited partners for purposes of determining whether the partner is a controlled commercial entity for purposes of section 892. The partnership’s activities will result in the partnership having to withhold tax under section 1446 on commercial income that is the effectively connected taxable income allocable to a foreign government partner.   Note. A foreign central bank of issue will be treated as a controlled commercial entity only if it engages in commercial activities within the United States.       Chapter 4 status.  The term chapter 4 status means a person’s status as a U.S. person, specified U.S. person, foreign individual, participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, restricted distributor, exempt beneficial owner, nonparticipating FFI, territory financial institution, excepted nonfinancial foreign entity (NFFE), or passive NFFE. See Regulations section 1.1471-1(b) for the definitions of these terms.    Deemed-compliant FFI.  Under section 1471(b)(2), certain FFIs are deemed to comply with the regulations under chapter 4 without the need to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS. However, certain deemed-compliant FFIs are required to register with the IRS and obtain a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN). These FFIs are referred to as registered deemed-compliant FFIs. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(f).    Exempt beneficial owner.  An exempt beneficial owner means a person that is described in Regulations section 1.1471-6 and includes a foreign government, a political subdivision of a foreign government, a wholly owned instrumentality or agency of a foreign government or governments, an international organization, a wholly owned agency or instrumentality of an international organization, a foreign central bank of issue, a government of a U.S. possession, certain retirement funds, and certain entities wholly owned by one or more exempt beneficial owners. In addition, an exempt beneficial owner includes any person treated as an exempt beneficial owner under an applicable Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA.    Financial institution.  A financial institution generally means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or an insurance company (or holding company of an insurance company) that issues cash value insurance or annuity contracts. See Regulations section 1.1471-5(e).    Foreign central bank of issue.  A foreign central bank of issue is a bank that is by law or government sanction the principal authority, other than the government itself, to issue instruments intended to circulate as currency. Such a bank is generally the custodian of the banking reserves of the country under whose law it is organized. The Bank of International Settlements is treated as though it were a foreign central bank of issue. A foreign central bank of issue must provide Form W-8EXP to establish eligibility for exemption from withholding for payments exempt from tax under either section 892 or section 895.    Foreign financial institution (FFI).  A foreign financial institution (FFI) generally means a foreign entity that is a financial institution.    Foreign person.  A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, foreign estate, foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign person.    Foreign government.  For chapter 3 purposes, a foreign government includes only the integral parts or controlled entities of a foreign sovereign as defined in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-2T. Similar definitions apply for chapter 4 purposes under Regulations section 1.1471-6(b). An integral part of a foreign sovereign, in general, is any person, body of persons, organization, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of a foreign country. The net earnings of the governing authority must be credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion benefiting any private person. A controlled entity of a foreign sovereign is an entity that is separate in form from the foreign sovereign or otherwise constitutes a separate juridical entity only if:   It is wholly owned and controlled by the foreign sovereign directly or indirectly through one or more controlled entities. It is organized under the laws of the foreign sovereign by which it is owned. Its net earnings are credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion of its income benefiting any private person. Its assets vest in the foreign sovereign upon dissolution.    A controlled entity of a foreign sovereign also includes a pension trust defined in Temporary Regulations section 1.892-2T(c) and may include a foreign central bank of issue to the extent that it is wholly owned by a foreign sovereign. A foreign government must provide Form W-8EXP to establish eligibility for exemption from withholding for payments exempt from tax under section 892 or for purposes of establishing its status as an exempt beneficial owner.    Intergovernmental agreement (IGA).  An IGA means a Model 1 IGA or a Model 2 IGA. For a list of jurisdictions treated as having in effect a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, see the list of jurisdictions at www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA-Archive.aspx. A Model 1 IGA means an agreement between the United States or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs to such foreign government or agency thereof, followed by automatic exchange of the reported information with the IRS. An FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction that performs account reporting to the jurisdiction’s government is referred to as a reporting Model 1 FFI. A Model 2 IGA means an agreement or arrangement between the U.S. or the Treasury Department and a foreign government or one or more agencies to implement FATCA through reporting by FFIs directly to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of an FFI agreement, supplemented by the exchange of information between such foreign government or agency thereof and the IRS. An FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that has entered into an FFI agreement with respect to a branch is a participating FFI, but may be referred to as a reporting Model 2 FFI.    International organization.  For purposes of chapter 3, an international organization is any public international organization entitled to enjoy privileges, exemptions, and immunities as an international organization under the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288-288(f)). In general, to qualify as an international organization, the United States must participate in the organization pursuant to a treaty or under the authority of an Act of Congress authorizing such participation. Any organization that qualifies as an international organization under chapter 3 also qualifies as an international organization under chapter 4.  For purposes of chapter 4, an international organization also includes any intergovernmental or supranational organization that is comprised primarily of foreign governments, that is recognized as an intergovernmental or supranational organization under a foreign law similar to 22 U.S.C. 288-288(f) or that has in effect a headquarters agreement with a foreign government, and whose income does not inure to the benefit of private persons.    Participating FFI.  A participating FFI is an FFI that has agreed to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to all branches of the FFI, other than a branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a U.S. branch. The term participating FFI also includes a reporting Model 2 FFI and a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution, unless such branch is a reporting Model 1 FFI.    Specified U.S. person.  A specified U.S. person is any U.S. person other than a person identified in Regulations section 1.1473-1(c).    Substantial U.S. owner.

Territory financial institution.  The term territory financial institution means a financial institution that is incorporated or organized under the laws of any U.S. territory. However, an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company is not a territory financial institution.    Withholdable payment.  The term withholdable payment means an amount subject to withholding for purposes of chapter 4 as described in Amounts subject to withholding, earlier. Also see Regulations section 1.1473-1(a) for the definition of withholdable payment.    Withholding agent.  Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of U.S. source FDAP income subject to chapter 3 or 4 withholding is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies.      Specific Instructions    Part I — Identification of Beneficial Owner Before completing Part I, complete the Worksheet for Foreign Governments, International Organizations, and Foreign Central Banks of Issue, later, to determine whether amounts received are or will be exempt from U.S. tax under section 892 or 895 and exempt from withholding under sections 1441 and 1442. Use the results of this worksheet to check the appropriate box on line 3 and in Part II. Do not give the worksheet to the withholding agent. Instead, keep it for your records.  Line 1.  Enter the full name of the organization.    Line 2.  Enter the country under the laws of which the foreign government or other foreign organization was created, incorporated, organized, or governed.    Line 3.  Check the one box that applies. A foreign central bank of issue (wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) should check the ""Foreign government"" box. If you are a Foreign private foundation, you should check the ""Foreign private foundation"" box rather than the ""Foreign tax-exempt organization"" box.     Line 4.  Check the one box that applies to your chapter 4 status (if necessary). You are required to provide a chapter 4 status if you are the payee of a withholdable payment or hold an account with an FFI requesting this form. See Regulations section 1.1471-3(a) for the definition of a payee for purposes of chapter 4. By checking a box on this line, you are representing that you qualify for this classification and, if you are claiming a status as an exempt beneficial owner, that you are the beneficial owner of the payments to which this form relates for purposes of chapter 4.      For certain chapter 4 statuses, you are required to complete an additional line on this form certifying that you meet the conditions of the status indicated on line 4 (as defined under Regulations section 1.1471-5 or 1.1471-6 or an applicable IGA). Make sure you complete the required portion of this form before signing and providing it to the withholding agent.    If you do not certify as to your chapter 4 status, this Form W-8EXP will not be valid for purposes of chapter 4 if you receive a withholdable payment at any time in the future. For example, if you do not certify as to your chapter 4 status because the only payments you receive from the withholding agent are with respect to grandfathered obligations described in Regulations section 1.1471-2(b), then you will be required to resubmit Form W-8EXP and certify to your chapter 4 status if you receive a withholdable payment in the future. You may consider certifying to your chapter 4 status even if not required in order to avoid resubmitting Form W-8EXP to the withholding agent. See Expiration of Form W-8EXP, earlier.  Line 5.  The permanent address of a foreign government, international organization, or foreign central bank of issue is where it maintains its principal office. For all other organizations, the permanent address is the address in the country where the organization claims to be a resident for tax purposes. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes unless such address is the only permanent address you use and it appears as your registered address in your organizational documents.    Line 6.  Enter the mailing address only if it is different from the address shown on line 5.    Line 7.  A U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN) means an employer identification number (EIN). A U.S. TIN is generally required if you are claiming an exemption or reduced rate of withholding based solely on your claim of tax-exempt status under section 501(c) or private foundation status. Use Form SS-4, to obtain an EIN.    Line 8a.  If the organization has registered with the IRS as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), direct reporting NFFE, check the ""GIIN"" box and provide your GIIN. For payments made prior to January 1, 2015, a Form W-8EXP provided by a reporting Model 1 FFI need not contain a GIIN. For payments made prior to January 1, 2016, a sponsored direct reporting NFFE may provide the GIIN of its sponsoring entity.    Line 8b.  If you are providing this Form W-8EXP to document yourself as an account holder (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(a)(3)) with respect to a financial account (as defined in Regulations section 1.1471-5(b)) that you hold at a U.S. office of a financial institution (including a U.S. branch of an FFI) and you receive U.S. source income reportable on a Form 1042-S associated with this form, you must provide the TIN issued to you by the jurisdiction in which you are a tax resident identified on line 5 unless:  You have not been issued a TIN (including if the jurisdiction does not issue TINs), or You properly identified yourself as a foreign government, foreign central bank of issue, international organization, or government of a U.S. possession on line 3.  If you are providing this form to document a financial account described above but you do not enter a TIN on line 8b, and you are not a foreign government, foreign central bank of issue, international organization, or government of a U.S. possession, you must provide the withholding agent with an explanation of why you have not been issued a TIN. For this purpose, an explanation is a statement that you are not legally required to obtain a TIN in your jurisdiction of tax residence. The explanation may be written on line 8b, in the margins of the form, or on a separate attached statement associated with the form. If you are writing the explanation on line 8b, you may shorten it to ""not legally required."" Do not write ""not applicable.""                 Line 9.  This line may be used by the filer of Form W-8EXP or by the withholding agent to whom it is provided to include any referencing information that is necessary or useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its obligations. For example, a filer may use line 9 to include the name and number of the account for which the filer is providing the form.       Part II — Qualification Statement for Chapter 3 Status    You are not required to complete a chapter 3 qualification statement if you are submitting this form to document your chapter 4 status and are not receiving a payment that is subject to withholding under chapter 3. However, in such a case, you may also provide Form W-8BEN-E to document your chapter 4 status.  Line 10.  All foreign governments claiming the applicability of section 892 must check box 10a as well as box 10b or box 10c, whichever applies. Enter the name of the foreign sovereign’s country on line 10b (if the entity is an integral part of a foreign government) or on line 10c (if the entity is a controlled entity). A central bank of issue (wholly owned by a foreign sovereign) should check box 10c.    Line 11.  Check this box if you are an international organization. By checking this box, you are certifying to all the statements made in line 11.    Line 12.  Check this box if you are a foreign central bank of issue for purposes of chapter 3 (see definitions) not wholly owned by a foreign sovereign. By checking this box, you are certifying to all the statements made in line 12.    Line 13.  If you are a foreign tax-exempt organization, you must attach a statement setting forth any income that is includible under section 512 in computing your unrelated business taxable income.    Box 13a. Check this box if you have been issued a determination letter by the IRS. Enter the date of the IRS determination letter.     Box 13b. Check this box if you do not have an IRS determination letter, but are providing an opinion of U.S. counsel concluding that you are an organization described in section 501(c).     Box 13c. If you are a section 501(c)(3) organization, check this box if you are not a private foundation. You must attach to the withholding certificate an affidavit setting forth sufficient facts concerning your operations and support to enable the IRS to determine that you would be likely to qualify as an organization described in section 509(a)(1), (2), (3), or (4). See Rev. Proc. 92-94, 1992-2 C.B. 507, section 4, for information on affidavit preparation of foreign equivalents of domestic public charities.     Box 13d. Check this box if you are a section 501(c)(3) organization and you are a private foundation described in section 509.     Line 14.  Check this box if you are a government of a U.S. possession. By checking this box you are certifying to the statements made in line 14.       Part III — Qualification Statement for Chapter 4 Status    You are not required to complete a chapter 4 qualification statement if you are not the payee of a withholdable payment or are not an accountholder holding an account with an FFI requesting this form.  Line 15.  Check this box to indicate that you are treated as a nonreporting FFI under an applicable IGA (and as defined in the IGA). You must identify the applicable IGA by entering the name of the jurisdiction that has the applicable IGA in effect with the United States. You must also provide the withholding agent with the class of entity described in Annex II of the IGA applicable to your status. If you are an FFI treated as a registered deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable Model 2 IGA, you must provide your GIIN in the space provided.     Line 16.  Check this box if you are a territory financial institution. By checking this box, you are certifying to the statement in line 16.    Line 17.  Check this box if you are a foreign government, government of a U.S. possession, or foreign central bank of issue as defined for purposes of chapter 4 (see Regulations section 1.1471-6). By checking this box, you are certifying to the statement made in line 17.    Line 18.  Check this box if you are an exempt retirement plan of a foreign government as defined for purposes of chapter 4. By checking this box, you are certifying to all the statements made in line 18.    Line 19.  Check this box if you are a 501(c) organization other an insurance company described in section 501(c)(15). By checking this box, you are certifying to the statement made in line 19.    Line 20.  Check box 20a if you are passive NFFE. If you do not have any substantial U.S. owners, check box 20b. If you have any substantial U.S. owners, you must provide a statement with the information set forth on line 20c.    Line 21.  Check box 21 if you are a sponsored direct reporting NFFE. Provide the name of your sponsoring entity in the space provided. By checking this box, you are certifying to the statements made in line 21.       Part IV — Certification Form W-8EXP must be signed and dated by an authorized official of the foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession, as appropriate. By signing Form W-8EXP, the authorized representative, officer, or agent also agrees to provide a new form within 30 days following a change in circumstances that makes any certification made on the form incorrect (unless no future payments will be made to the organization by the withholding agent). The authorized representative, officer, or agent must also check the box to certify that he or she has the capacity to sign for the organization.  A withholding agent may allow you to provide this form with an electronic signature. The electronic signature must indicate that the form was electronically signed by a person authorized to do so (for example, with a time and date stamp and statement that the form has been electronically signed). Simply typing your name into the signature line is not an electronic signature.     Instructions for Form W-8EXP - Notices    Paperwork Reduction Act Notice. We ask for the information on this form to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States. You are required to provide the information.
